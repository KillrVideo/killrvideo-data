starting our summer series where we're going to be building three different apps uh give us a thumbs up in the chat if you can see and hear us clearly we just want to make sure that we're not facing any technical difficulties okay great one two one two oh yeah cool great well today we are we're going to start out our summer series by building our first app with javascript and node.js we're going to be using react as well um and so it'll be very beginner friendly and we're just going to start with the basics and build you up from there so a little introduction uh this is our developer advocates team uh i am ryan welford i'm joined with uh by david gilardi hello david hello hello everybody cedric lundvin hello cedric hello everybody super happy to be with you for another workshop another week and you know what it's not only me ryan and david on screen we also have the full advocacy team from data stacks there for you today answering your question in the live so that would be a great session all about interactivity let's get rolling yes okay so we're gonna do a little bit of housekeeping uh right off the bat just to get you introduced to some of the tools that we'll be using so we are streaming on youtube and twitch uh we monitor the uh the youtube chat mostly for questions so if you're watching on twitch we're not very active in that chat so if you want to ask some questions you can go to youtube chat or we also have the our discord that we have a large community i think over 13 000 people now um and we are also monitoring that chat as well for questions and that's a good place to ask some long-term questions as well we can continue helping you outside of the workshop times um mentee.com is a tool that we're going to be using for our game today we are going to do a quiz at the end and you have an opportunity to win some swag um and the the quiz is uh a lot of fun uh you get a lot of points and uh and answer some questions about the workshop um some of the tools that we'll be using we have our github repo uh that hosts all of our content um and we'll be working through that it's kind of a designed to be self-service as well as facilitated by our workshop so we'll be dropping that link in the in the chat soon and we're also going to be using a cloud ide called gitpod and that's going to be um allow us to edit the code directly in our browsers without having to install any ides if you don't have any and it integrates really tightly with github so it's really nice to use and that's a tool we'll be using and we'll walk you through how to how to get that set up we are going to be using astrodb as our database today and um it comes with some apis as well with stargate um this is our nosql database that we'll be using for throughout our summer series for all of our apps and we'll walk you through how to how to set that account up and it'll be ready for you for all three workshops if you're joining us for all all of the series um but it is a uh a managed cassandra instance in the cloud um which is a fantastic nosql database and we're really excited to have you use it so i am going to go ahead and hand it off to cedric who is going to talk us through uh how the summer series is going to work yes so let's go quickly because we do have a lot of technical stuff to cover so we are starting a journey for three weeks uh three workshops you can run each worker shop as a standalone session but that will be a progression in between now and in three weeks more and more advanced stuff so today is really beginner beginner so it's a live workshop as ryan stated you can ask questions we will play games together and you will do hands-on with nothing to install okay that's being said second after the workshop we will ask you to do some homeworks if you want to do the homework it will simply complain complete all the steps that we did today in front of you it's explained step by step do not worry it's very easy and to submit the artwork it will be on github super easy so why would you do the homework well when you do the homework we will grant you some badges so there is no certificate to attend the session but if you do the workshop we will give you a badge and you can brag with those badges on linkedin after three weeks if you get the three badges you get the golden bass stating that you have completed the series congratulations and then for anybody that have completed the series really we will ship you some real slash swag to your location okay so the stickers of your badge and more swag so yes stay with us with the three weeks do the homework and you know you will get this swag shipped to you that's cool right the only thing you have to do is learn with us uh in three weeks and guess what i even have a surprise for you so now you will be very excited well um we are also starting a game okay this is the url we will provide you the url again at the end it's the google form to enter the game you need to complete at least one or more get one page and then you feel if you have multiple pages that's more chance for you to win and you can you will see in the form um that we can ask you to follow the youtube channel to do the homework with us and also eventually to write a blog post about what you learn what you like and even doing your own sample app and the more things you do the more points you get and beginning of august we will deliver three gift three amazon gift card to three among you at the audience uh you know not for the best submission but randomly based on how many points you get you have that many chance to win so everybody can participate even really beginner you know the more you do the better are your chance so good luck everybody we will share this link again uh very soon to you and with that i think uh enough with the housekeeping and introduction let's go to the technical stuff what do you think yeah let's guys it let's do it let's do it i do see some questions about how long is our session today cedric so the session will be two hours uh to do the end zone and and demo uh we will do a lot of demo in front of you but we will stay a third hours live with you to answer your question and redo the arm works because maybe we will do two we will go too fast so overall it will be three hours live with you uh but the full content will be covered in the first two hours okay so in these two hours this is what we will cover application 101 what is an application really start from the beginning from scratch presentation layer uh data databases application layer and then we will do all the giveaways and and um all the nice stuff we will give you even today okay so application 101 really for the beginner what is an application what is the first thing you might think about when i told you about applications mobile apps of course this is what we use every day multiple times a day we spend way too many hours in front of our phone or application that you will run on your laptop desktop application okay but if you look at those application you can do some strengths weakness open it opportunities thread diagram this is what we call a swot so the strength because it's native install on your hardware it will be the most performant and you can have the extended features of what the mobile can offer or the laptop can offer so it seems great but there are a lot of weakness as well you know as a developer you need to learn how to develop in one device or another one framework or another and also you know it can be cumbersome for user to install your app still there are some opportunities like uh better usage smooth smooth integration there are also some threats security if you ask a user to install an app you know it could be a tronia trojan horse a key logger stuff like that so for today the application we will talk about and discuss about are the web application development or web app so why would you do a web application well the idea is to have the same code that you can use and invoke from multiple devices laptop mobile tablet it's responsive so the ui will adapt based on the device you are using but to be honest you will interact with the same progression layer so how does it work you are working on a mobile like you know for instance watching at youtube you are on one of your brother either on mobile or on the web some application i don't know if you're aware but some applications are fully web even if you do need to install them you know like twitch for instance i don't know if you realize that when you install twitch exactly the same as the website this is called progressive application it's a new way of developing a mobile app and it's mostly a web view with extended features it's the best of the two work it's coming so the client you know that all browser-based now what about the presentation presentation here on the front end it's a web server with three technology technology html css javascript that i will cover right after that these web server need something to interact with this is what we call a back-end exposing some service apis micro service you might have heard the world and finally you need somewhere to store the data if your application stateful have a state so could be database file system external storage or even third-party tools you know like document oriented um software so this is the overall architecture of the web application development and guess what we will cover all of them today in the two hours so no time to waste let's dig into frontier presentation layer so there remember html css javascript today's back to basics so let's take a little bit about those three things first html so to be honest anything that's uh that is on the web webview are real html ipertx markup language this is really the language of the web your web brother will read this markup and we render this markup as your user interface so it's an xml as you can see on the screen but it's not strongly validated you know now you can have not a really well formatted uh xml it will still work until you especially validated that i need x ht x html and unforced validation so you know what it looks like it's a xml-based markup and there on an html file extension.html or dot htm you will define what your web ui should look like so the part so the body the heads maybe you can you can see that and in the body you will put some structures what is a paragraph what is a link what is an image what is a table and a subdivision is really what is the most important to be honest in the front-end world division this is where you will define area of your screen so today and i think we did not talk about that yet we will build together a to-do app and if i told you to build a tutu app only with html yes you could and actually this is what i did in codepen so you can if you want go to content dot io slash data stacks devs and you will see that a first pen that i created it's the to-do list but only using html so here i do have the tag html some head to describe the metadata of my page body well i do have the structures and here i do have one div okay um in the div i do have some text i do have a form this is where you see the input i can add another input that could be input type button and you will immediately realize that as soon as i change something it will be it will be shown on here below and here i i do have a button so you know the browser will render in real time this html format with form div and list okay good enough now if you want to add some styling in your code you can add the style attribute on the tag div or any tag you can just add style and look at that so as of now the border is blue i can change the border in red and it will be re-render and now the border is red and any piece of the data could be edited to say hey now maybe this guy should have the color red okay and you know let me do the proper syntax uh style color red and that guy should be now uh in red maybe not sure what i miss maybe i should have a span but never mind you got the id send something here and it will be reflected here okay but it can be pretty you know annoying to provide the style everywhere it will have a very long html so to avoid doing that the second item that you want to to learn is css cascade style sheets this is how you will style your web page instead of in instead of creating in each tag i want this area in blue uh i apply a line i don't want this margin or the background you will do it once provide a name and now each time you would like to apply this style you will say hey div class is and provide the name of the css like that it's a way to mutualize all the styling okay if you provide a html tag like body it will be apply on the body and you don't have to do anything if you are using a dedicated name this is what where so the name could be uh either dot something or ash something it it will be either a style that would be reused a class or a unique style if you use the id and you can mix all these classes with something called a selectors so hey semicolon visited means that that should be applied on a link only when the user have clicked on this link simply put css is also the framework that brings the responsive because if you put the screen in big or the screen is small css will be able to detect and there are some dedicated tags like media to hide or change part of the screen based on the resolution of the screen to be honest that is how the responsive is done okay css is pretty powerful but can be extended you know maybe you want to have a dedicated color of your own and you want that multiple classes use the same color so instead of copy pasting in the color in every class what you want to do is just define the variables and apply these colors everywhere but css by default does not allow to use variables to to extend that behavior you can use pre-process preprocessors pre-processing tools like sas or less and here you can see some sample sas and less with css you can also do some animation and do some moving parts if you wish to we provide you links in the slide the slide the exercises everything is available to you on github and the link is provided in the youtube description keep moving so it was our html to-do list hey what if i just add one uh spreadsheet to this to-do list this is what i do have my sample code 2 on codepen data slash dev so here you can see it's exactly the same html but i i i did a css just to provide some decoration on each on my div so here i do have my input and tasks one two three which now are you know still same task one two three but look at that the css can do some transformation at runtime if i over the link see i do have click to complete over it and if i click we can uh we can do some other stuff so that's css providing some style of an html okay what's next the next piece of the trio for front-end is javascript javascript is a programming language and i need to admit that it's probably the most successful and the most known yeah programming language now maybe with python but you know i'm old i'm a java guy i love java i would love to stick to java all all day long but hey that's the future so i will need to cope with that okay so the javascript uh will work with your html as well but javascript will see the html as a document object model dom you will still see tags but also properties attributes and also detect events if you click somewhere if you put your mouse over div if you do some user action click javascript will get an event and based on an event you can react and edit at runtime the html so but javascript is way bigger than that so now if i go back to my to-do list and i now add a third layer which is the javascript okay i still have the same html i still have the same css but now i define some variables const hey i would like the list over here to be one variable i would like my form to be one variable and i would like the items to be just eat them over here and now if i detect the submit event coming from the form stating that you type enter after entering a value well i will update the html of your page and so now if you look at that i do have a working to-do list because if i use you know sample one it's okay sample two it's okay because i append to my html this new row item of the list that's to add item but same if i click on one of the item i can detect this event and and do some computation if i check something i click on something and it was not checked i will change the class you know the css the the the attribute checking the radio button here and if i change the check it status then css know that oh now i need to change the style from the start to the checkbox okay and if i click and it's already checked i will update the html to remove it and see if i click it's done if i click it's in it if i click it's done if i click it's delete and i did not use any framework i didn't use any node or something like we talked about it's really with bear sample javascript not even using gquery or stuff no framework you can build your app so we are pretty happy about it right just by document get element by id that inner html we can change the the content of our page we can listen of the event of the user this is what we call client-side javascript so we are p we know javascript well you know this is what i think i this is what i think but you know just client-side javascript it's not enough you need a full stack of tools to make the application more complex and easy to use and this is what the frameworks will allow you to do frameworks at the html css part you know don't reinvent the wheel there are some pretty famous framework the more from the most famous is of course twitter bootstrap to build some user interface reusing some style using some division but also reusing some javascript okay so almost almost there and then we we can uh do stuff and show you real real stuff so what i did right now it's just showing static code no run time but hey node.js is a javascript runtime that will execute the javascript and provide end points to be contacted to it's like scalable open source and there you can now generate dynamic page content and you can start interacting with the data i see the question quickly on the on the chat what was before storage over here so storage is a class to use the storage in my brother what we call the local storage you know just to have a state full application because if i refresh that i still get my default task 1 task 2.3 and what you need is really a backend to be able to save that state and not using storage while node is an application server to help you build that application that you need so node is the runtime okay and when you build an application with node you get some extra tools so npm the node package manager is the command line that will download all the libraries remember on ring vendor will use libraries and framework npm will make you download and use existing libraries and will also help you to interact with your application start stop deploy build your application will be done through npm we will see that with ryan and pm run something and in the node stack you also have a node package runner so pre-build task so here i just put a screenshot of npx code say hello and that stuff will just display in the output a co would say hello so the guy who invented that is just a genius but that gives you the the id npx is what we will use to start creating a real app because it will do stuff for us so npx to execute and run something npm.package manager and uh finally it would be my last uh slide about the frameworks and the acoustic step at the front-end side and it's react so i told you in the node.js world we reuse some frameworks when it comes to front-end advanced user interface three big frameworks lead the way react view and angular so today we will focus on the most famous and it is react.js so javascript library to build some user interface and uh with already pre-built and ready to go user interface component but you will also build your own component no later than today okay so um last slide and i will hang over to ryan if you see the overall architecture of the web of the web architecture here we will focus on the presentation here the front end i already told you that we do have html css in javascript but we will have a runtime node.js and we will build the app using react and what is this guy git pod we told you we do not want you to install anything today um and to use that javascript stack you need id so integrated development environment like vs code or any id to to implement javascript guess what gitpod is a cloud-based web-based ide and if you know vs code you won't be surprised it's exactly vs code available for you for free in the cloud and with that i think i already talked too much and now it's time to show more all right now it's my turn we're gonna do a demo here um so this is something that uh we'll have you guys do in the homework but for now i just want you guys to follow along and watch so that um we can kind of get through it quickly and and you can absorb it and and we'll we'll run through it again maybe in the q a section if you guys have more questions but for now we're just going to do a quick demo on how to to create your first basic app in react using the create react app boilerplate so i'm going to move over here so uh this is i'm just working locally right now but you can do all of this in git pod as well um you just need a kind of a local uh install uh so the first uh set that we're gonna do is we're going to use that that npm runner that cedric talked about npx and we're going to use the create react app library and then we need to give our uh our new app a name so we're going to do my app and this will something real quick yeah sorry ryan if you don't mind um let me just jump in uh something real quick uh what everything that ryan is doing right we're gonna demo it now but then as part of the homework you'll have this to do for yourself in the homework right so don't worry about trying to do this at the moment or anything like that we'll just follow with ryan and then we'll we'll see you with the homework with this yeah yeah so don't don't feel like you have to keep up if you just want to sit back and watch you can if you i mean if you want to try and follow along uh you know that's that's definitely your choice but we there's a quite a bit to get through so we want to make sure that we um have everyone's attention uh so what mpx create react app is doing is it's downloading a few um basic dependencies that react will use uh to be able to create the basic app and it creates some some starting files like our entry point our index file and our our initial component and when it's done we'll actually be able to right away uh start the app um as a as a very simple kind of splash screen and we'll show that off okay so when it's done uh installing i just have to change the directory to the my app that i created which is right here and we can drop this down and see all of the files that it adds right here so this is kind of our starting point and we can go ahead and right away type npm start and this is going to start up our um our app and it should show up over here this is running a local server there we go so this is what you start out with when you use create react app it's just a basic splash screen with the react logo and it gives you a little bit of instructions you can edit source slash app.js and save and to reload so actually we can go ahead and make changes to app.js and it will automatically update in the browser we don't have to restart the server or anything like that it will dynamically change as we make changes um so we're gonna do just a quick change here uh i'm gonna get rid of this link and i'm gonna edit this text here so the uh link block we can just get rid of that and if i just change this text just do the classic hello world and i save it you'll see that it updates automatically right away this is really useful for uh you know developing your app and being able to see your changes right away and make adjustments and changes as as you need so we've you know we've removed some unnecessary links uh changed the text and uh it updates right away so this is the kind of main component of our app right app.js this is what has provided us as the entry point to our app and technically this is already a component one of the motifs of react is that everything is a component and you break things down into smaller and smaller components so that you have reusability and um and dynamic uh content so let's go ahead and create our own component so i'm just going to create a new folder here call it components gotta stay organized it's important and a new file and we're gonna call this uh so the the app that we're going to be building today is a to-do app right so we're gonna have a to-do list so i'm gonna make our basic first basic component uh a l a list component right so list.js is what i'm gonna call it and in here uh we need to do a few things we need to import react from reacts this is our our basic react library that we have to import wheel to use it and then we make our our component and uh a component is basically just a function right and we're gonna name it list and we're gonna return something and the return in react is what is going to be rendered uh to the dom that's what cedric was talking about that dynamic um uh page so this is what's what is actually going to be rendered to our page right and then we have to export this uh this component so that we can use it in other places we can import this into our app component and use it so what should we render lost my mouse then well let's think about a little bit we're going to have a list of items that we want to display so the first thing that we should do is maybe define an array [Music] of of items of text that we're going to display and it's going to be a to-do list right so um let's make a let's make a quick to-do list i'm gonna define an array uh it's always important to start your to-do list with easy things right so we're gonna get milk that's an easy thing to do uh then you gotta work your work your way up uh we're gonna buy amazon right that's the company so that's yep i'm just gonna buy amazon i mean you gotta you gotta make sure that you're always moving forward uh and then you know you have to save the hardest for for last so we're going to take over the world uh at the end so this is our to-do list right we have to get milk then buy amazon then we have to take over the world which i think is pretty reasonable those two dudes are so much better than my to-do's man geez you gotta be ambitious um okay so we're going to take this array uh and we're gonna render it out so i'm going to to take this array uh and map it and if you're not familiar with map i'll do a brief overview we're going to map each item in the array to a paragraph block and and this is our html right that cedric showed off this is our paragraph uh tag and we're just going to import the item uh we can just print the item there so the map function is a built-in function for arrays it just takes each uh each item as uh in the array and does something with it so i'm naming you know the the um the variable item is going to reference what you know the whatever uh position in the array it's it's talking to and then i'm just gonna take that variable and i'm gonna put it in here into the the paragraph tag and i need to put these brackets around it in react to say i'm using this as a variable i'm not using the word item right all right so this is our first component our list component we're gonna we need to find this array we're gonna map this array to um to this paragraph tag and it's gonna list each item in a paragraph tag right so let's go ahead and save this but now we actually have to use it right we still have our our page over here it's not doing anything it didn't change because we need to uh change our app.js the first thing we need to do is import our new component so if i import list from and then i have to navigate to our component so it's in the components directory and then list so now i've imported this component and i can actually replace our hello world with our list component just like that this is how you uh you use a component it looks very much like html this is uh um jsx i believe that's what it's called gs6 yep and so this is going to import our list component and display it right here and so if i save this you'll see that our list our to-do list get milk by amazon take over the world automatically gets updated on our page so that is your first component but this isn't very dynamic right this is still a static you know we've already we've predefined the the to do's um and you know every time we use this list component it's going to be those exact to-do's right uh so we're going to make it a little bit more dynamic by using what are called props and props is short for properties and it's something that we can use in our components to make them a little bit more reusable and dynamic so the first thing that we do uh before i move on i might be moving a little fast i know if there's any quick questions um yeah just quick question uh about arrow function so what uh you know why why did you arrow function and what does map do okay yeah i'll i'll do a quick uh overview of map again so map is a built-in function for arrays in javascript so this is just you know traditional javascript not special to react at all and all it does is it iterates through the array right so we have these three items in our array and it iterates through each item and it does something to it right and we're telling it what to do with each item with this arrow function right so this arrow function is taking a variable that i'm calling item and it's going to do this to it which is basically just wrap it in the paragraph tag and then print it yes so in java it's called a lambda function you know i will play the the the boring java guy multiple time today in java it's called the lambda function yes it is i think it can also be called a closure or mixing at some point okay so that's all the that's that's all the the map does is instead of doing a for loop and staying you know as long as we're less than the length of the array do this thing it's just a much easier way to to just use the built-in function uh and the arrow function is is basically just you know defining what we're doing to that to that stuff hopefully that's a good explanation all right so we are going to use some props which are properties so first i need to tell our component that it should be expecting some props which we put props in the parents here as a parameters and then i'm going to remove our array here and change this const a little bit to this and what this is doing is it's declaring a const and it's going to be looking for a property called item list so it's going to we're going to include some props with whenever we call this function we're going to include props with it and it's going this is going to look for a prop called item list and then it's going to use the item list just like normal but if we save this right away we're going to get an error over here it's going to say oh can't read property of map undefined because we have not defined our prop yet so in app.js we're going to add our item list prop right here so this is how we include properties with our components is when when we call it we're going to include a variable equals and we use these brackets to define what that variable is and so when our component is looking for item list it's looking for this to be defined and any time that we call our list component every time we use it we can provide a new property so if i save this we're going to see our our list right here right but i can actually reuse our list component give it a new property and well we failed to take over the world so we're going to go back to basics and just get some bread and get some eggs right hey so ryan i got a question for you it's one that i i see coming up a lot and i figured we should address it so why both index.js and app.js what's that about okay yes yeah so index.js is the entry point to the to the whole um site basically um this is um starting up the virtual dom um and then it's just rendering our first component app.js where that we're importing here um and i believe let's see if i can find it so indox index.html um is kind of the page the html page that we're uh using and it should be importing the index index.js um maybe maybe a mistake in there uh in any case index.js is really just the oh here it is so document.getelementbyid root so in our index.html we have our our all of our header information and then we have our body and then we have this div root and so our index.js is basically injecting our virtual dom into this element and then importing our app component and rendering it hopefully that makes a little more sense it's just uh typically i i've always left index.js alone maybe remove the report web vitals if you don't need the performance stuff and then make all your changes starting with app.js it also imports your css your index.css file so if you need to do the stylings and stuff this is where you would do it um but that's the main difference um okay cool thank you yep so as you can see uh i'm actually gonna move cedric's head a little bit exploding yeah so i've used bread i i can't get the bread yes please now i can get it yeah french bread is aware either yeah it's the best yeah no no doubt uh so i'm i'm reusing our component again but i'm giving it a new array a new list of items and it go it prints them just fine right so now this component is reusable and i i'm not hard coding the list of items directly into the component which is definitely the way to go all right so now our component is dynamic all we need to do is get a list of items as an array and we can use our components component to list these items out but we can go deeper because this list is actually can be broken up into smaller sub components by creating a new component for our items so let's do that you'll you'll figure out real quickly that react is basically components all the way down uh it's pretty fun but when it's all the way down man [Laughter] so i'm going to create this new component item i'm just going to paste this uh code in here and it's this is super simple right we're going to use properties again it's going to be looking for a prop called item and it's just going to wrap that item in a paragraph tag and print it out super simple almost uh you can almost ask yourself why we're doing this but i'll show you why but then we need to import uh our item component from come on if i can type from item and then i'm just going to replace this with our item and give our our prop value like that so i'm using our component item i'm mapping each of the entries to our array to this property called item and here's our array index so item item item so now i can save that and nothing has changed right because uh we basically have just broken it up into smaller subcomponents but now this item component can be customized uh more easily customized um on the kind of granular level right um so one of the things that we can do with this item and i'm just this is going to be pasting a lot of code uh but we can use this code to create um some interactivity uh with our items so if i just go ahead and save this when i hover over each of these items did not change there we go when i hover over the background changes right so now we you know have a kind of a hover effect and all i'm doing is you know using our on mouse over and on mouse out functions and i'm defining functions uh called handle mouse over and handle mouse out to set the background whenever those things happen whenever those events happen oh um can i have a red circle in front of me as well if you put the mouse over me uh yeah if you were part of the website oh actually hold on that that's actually a fun idea no no that's not walking [Laughter] and put cedric on the logo all right so oh there you go there you go i like that yeah yeah now everybody you know use reaction use reacts use react so now we have a little bit of interactivity now we know you know what we're hovering over something else that we can do uh is add some input so this is going to be a to-do list eventually right so if i oops paste this code so now we are adding uh instead of just a paragraph tag we're using a div and then we're adding an input of a check box input style type check box uh and then our label is our item name and then when we have our on change so whenever the check box is changed we're going to set is checked which is how we save the state of whether it's checked or not so now if we say this now we have checkboxes in front of our oh i gotta move cedric now we have checkboxes in front of each of our items okay and we can check it and uh oh we didn't we didn't take over the world but i'll check it anyway so now we have um some more interactivity with our components and we have more granular control over each item and we can we can do a lot of really cool things so that's your basic uh component structure how to make your basic components how to organize them you know trying to break it down into the smallest sub-components that you can um you could even have you know these check boxes themselves b components so that you can style those components and and do some cool things with them as well but that is kind of the very basic how-to for react um so let's see if there's any questions um we got a question about the states i don't know how much you want to go that's wrong yeah so let's see i'll make this window a little bit bigger [Music] so i'll briefly talk about uh state um remove cedric again uh so i did kind of copy this this code in uh without explaining it so there is uh this is called a hook so we're using this hook use state and basically this is a way to save uh save some information about our components and and what it's doing so i'm using this to to determine if a a check box is checked or not so the way this is used is i'm defining a const i'm giving it a name uh is checked and then using the hook i'm giving uh oops i'm moving stuff around i'm defining the name of the of of of a function of a setter function basically so this is called set is checked and basically if i call this function and give it uh a boolean value right like i'm doing right here it's going to change the value of our state variable to the value that i give it and then i'm using the use state hook and i'm giving it a default value so it's going to start out false meaning it's not checked and then if i want to check it i can set is checked to true and that will change uh the value of this state variable to true and then the input has a a variable checked that determines whether it's the checked variant of the checkbox or the unchecked variant of the checkbox and i'm just mapping it to the uh state so whether it's true or false it will update appropriately so something to note and we'll and i think david will we'll talk about this uh in a bit is um anytime that state changes uh component will automatically re-render and anytime a prop changes the component will automatically re-render and uh david's going to visualize that a little bit so hey uh ryan question for you i see this one coming in a couple times so if i click on the check box again we'll be unchecked uh currently no uh yeah so that is something that's uh i would have to do so we could do a little bit of live coding uh i would want to instead of um straight up using the set is checked i'd want to have a handler so i'd have a handle uh handle checking um and i would create a function to handle that and basically it would kind of toggle it right so if it i would check if it's true then set it to false and if it's false then set it to true and that would give me a toggle ability and a follow-up to that ryan is are type checked and unchanged reserved keywords or did you make them up um so type checked and on change uh are reserved keywords for the input tag i had a feeling that multiple people may have had that question yeah live coding with ryan if i can spell yeah let's let's be the the demo god yeah this is the best part right when everybody's watching you type right i know and see if we can mess ryan up you know just yeah yeah yeah you do not want to know how many people are watching right right yeah yeah don't don't tell me oh hold on it's probably gonna there so now i can uncheck it sherman says this is scary victory okay yeah put all the victory in the chat didn't make a mistake but yeah so this is how you probably want to do it this is you you create a specific handler and then you call the set is checked depending on yeah that's how you'd probably want to do it nice pressure was high but i did it yeah 80s i just went to the 80s sorry now shot asked if we can use the not operator instead of else uh you could uh i just use else because i'm checking i have to check one thing and then if i if it's not bad then it's the other one so that's why i did that all right cool so yeah this basics of react that should you know getting the the basic create react app uh going getting your basic app um and then making your first components and that this uh will will definitely get you started so with that i am going to hand it back over to cedric uh would you do that do you want that i need to walk make cedric ernest keep right she's can you put me back to the react logo round of me no i didn't i just kind of like me i did kind of like you on top of the react logo i thought that was really nice okay i don't know if you can see it but i'm i'm seeing a double screen effect you might want to turn off your uh your your video oh you know what i would just do one slide so i don't know okay but yeah i can see just a hum right on the left yeah okay so let me move uh to the database you know as of now we do have a react a full working react app but the states the to-do's are still stored in memory and we would like to be able to store that in the database so the front-end tier okay done it's green we are ready um now we will look into the database again we don't want you to install anything today and we'd have a good news for you um at data stacks we do have a db that you can use for free and it's called astra db and the next and zone will be now your turn to work and to create these astra db just to have a database ready to go when later we will do some code and would like to interact with the database and we do the database before because it will take a few minutes for the database to initialize before be able to accept the queries astradb is based on a nosql database called apache cassandra no mongodb is not the only nosql database out there for the front end so we are not using a stack like burn or min we are using astradibi as a database and you will see how easy it is to use and with that let's move to the astra db part and i think now it's david's turn to work a little bit right oh now i gotta i gotta work now all right yeah it seems like to be me or mikey yep yep yep and i wouldn't have been pretty quiet david count on me to disturb you david all right yeah no you disturb away disturb away hopefully you are seeing my screen and now for so many of you no we don't know not yet no we do just oh do we see the screen no we do okay good all right all right so for so many of you who've been asking um where you know the github repo and everything like that this is now the part where you're going to start doing some of this stuff with us right i've seen a ton of questions come through uh with regard to the database right i think people there were a lot of really insightful questions seeing you guys work with the to do items be like where are you storing this is there a backing database and as cedric was just talking we hadn't gotten there just yet so we're going to do that now so i'm going to give you the rainbow as a matter of fact i'm just going to give you the link to this first part here so here is the first exercise so step one let me go ahead and pop this in and i'm going to spam it so it doesn't get missed there you go i spammed it i wasn't kidding okay i wasn't kidding now by the way you know um and i've seen some questions about this as well if you're just watching for now that's totally cool right you can you can we have a couple different ways so at the end once we finish the two hours we're actually going to stay around for another hour do some qa and get started on the homework so if you want to do stuff then that's totally cool if you want to watch the video later and do it we have our discord channel you can come and get help or chat with us anytime but everything should be in here um what i'm going to do at this point is i'm just going to start stepping through step one with you let's get our database up and going and then we're going to start to slowly kind of connect up the app to the database and kind of see what that looks like yes heidi someone's got to block me for spamming that's true so by the way um something else i want to point out on these buttons on any of the buttons you see in here unfortunately the markdown does not us allow does not allow us to do a target blank so what that means is if you click on it it's just going to take over the tab you're in in a lot of cases that's not what you want to do so i really suggest either right click say open link a new tab or to middle click or control click whatever it is on your system to launch into another tab that's exactly what i'm going to do here that's what you see me doing here so if you've never used astro before and i know the question will come up this is totally free you'll not be asked for a credit card you won't have to pay a thing everything we're going to do is in a free tier so if you've never signed up before then you can either sign up with google with github or you can just put in an account i'm now i obviously have an account so i'm just going to go ahead and sign in and it should only take a moment to register oh yeah go ahead now just is it's free i already see some questions coming you know don't worry about the 25 dollar or anything like that you know it's free no credit card no charge that's that has tax paying for you up till you reach uh 40 million query per month it will not happen anytime soon don't worry about that it's totally free yeah and you know you won't get charged any yes and rush one are we going to do a to-do app yes yeah you're going to do a to-do app um that's actually what we're driving to now yeah we're totally doing that yes okay so now for some of you who have come in if you've never had a database before and you've registered you might actually come to a screen that looks like this okay it's going to normally blow this up just a little bit for you right and you're going to see this create a database screen um and if you are curious uh if you get asked for like a plan pick the page you go now i recognize we say it's free and they're like whoa whoa pay as you go that's it that's just the way that it's it's named it's because it's serverless and it can expand dynamically and contract dynamically um you get as part of the free tier like 40 gigabytes of storage millions of reads and writes we are never going to touch that right and again if you don't put in a credit card you'll never be charged a thing so pick pay as you go like i said you'll see a screen that looks like this it says create a database now at that point if you scroll down a little bit you'll notice in the instructions right we have this database name and key space now you can technically put whatever you want but we're asking for the purposes of this workshop use these values right so when i go to the database name i'm going to put in that to do's workshop db just like you see here and then for the key space i want to use to do's now as far as the regions and the providers you can choose any of them now the question always comes up hey do you have to like pay aws or have an account no that is 100 being managed by astr for you this is just we're just giving you a choice it's flexibility on what provider you want um pick a region that is close to you i'm in the east coast of north america so i'm gonna pick something close to me right the closer the better and then once i have my database name my key space name and a provider and region then create database to light up i just say create database and it will create now this is going to take just a moment right as cedric mentioned a second ago um it will it'll take it a couple minutes to start one of these up this is a fully featured nosql cassandra cluster that you're getting right um what's really awesome about this is you can literally just point click and start the thing up and then go from there and you're getting all the benefits of cassandra and such like that so it does take just a couple minutes um what you're looking for is either it'll say pending or initializing if that's the case you're totally cool so once you get here give us a thumbs up let us know we want to get a feel for where everybody is um does astra have drivers for spring boot hey relentless how you doing um cedric i believe you probably have answered that oh yeah so yeah what did you find the question but anyway um i have created a spring boot starter for astra so you know it's on the maven central and you know you can go to that on github go to data stack slash astra sdk java or you know reach me uh a dm and i will send you the link i'm the one maintaining the the spring boot starter for for this technology awesome i am seeing a set of thumbs up coming coming in wonderful it sounds like our databases are getting created exactly so again we can just leave that go for a moment and i'm seeing plenty of those come in all right awesome all right so what i'm gonna do now is we're going to go to session step 2 create a security token so if you think about it when you have a cloud-based any kind of cloud-based service but a cloud-based database or something like this in order for your your clusters your databases your servers whatever to be accessible to your applications well you know the endpoints have to be publicly available but you don't want to have your instances and your databases just wide out in the open right you need a layer of security you're going to find by the way for any of the cloud providers amazon google azure anyone really out there you know having a security token is kind of the way you do things right astra is no different so we do provide that security layer as well so what we're going to do here is now mind you there is a link right here if you go to this link it'll actually bring you through the instructions on how to create a security token you'll notice these little showmes as well if you click on one of those we have little animated gifs in here that show you what to do now i'm going to step through this with you we're going to do together right we'll create our token um but i just wanted to point out that there are app links and the animated gifs if you're going to do this later and on your own we've tried to provide resources so you have the instructions of what to do yes so many thumb up so people are following perfect that's great excellent okay so the next thing i'm gonna do at this point i should still be in my dashboard i have my active database wonderful now i want to come up to the top left hand corner where it says current organization there's a drop down here and in there there's organization settings so go to organization settings and then token management all right yeah um mahendran we are going to do swagger we're going to get into a little bit later we need to set up this token first uh because in order to do anything with swagger that whole security layer i'm talking about you need a way that you can authenticate in order to talk to the database throughout you know with any of the api so we need to set this up first yeah you know speaking of which david maybe maybe you should say a word of mp on apis after you created the token yeah maybe are we going to talk about api cedric what do you think all right so let's put your token you know yeah let's create the token first let's create create the token first okay so now once i'm in token management i want to select my role in this case go ahead and just pick database administrator and say generate token now here's the key thing right these once you show this once if you navigate away from this page you will not be able to get these values again what you want to do is say download that csv so that way you have a way to access it later right now if you leave this page open you can do that you can actually use these little copy widgets to pull it but you're going to need this later so really download the csv so you do have access to this later now something very very key about these tokens don't ever share them right in the homework especially in the homework when we're going to ask you to give her screenshots and stuff you don't ever want your token to go out in the open now right now you might ask about mine well guess what after the session i'm going to delete that promptly um because this will give people access to your database right that's exactly why after you you generate them and you navigate away you can't just get it again um so again make sure to download that csv so you have it locally because you're going to need this later okay so once you've generated your token let's see a thumbs up let's make sure you're good download your csv and then we'll move on to the next section yes me me not just kidding and then a matter of fact i should point out i i totally didn't tell you that um when you're in this token section if you to get back you'll find there's this little asteroid click on the astra here that'll bring you back you could go a couple different ways but if yeah you click on the little icon up here it'll bring you back oh reggie i will share the github link here in a moment for step three all right i'm seeing some thumbs up folks are getting their tokens generated i'll give them a second all right here is for step three i'm gonna spam it again because i like to spam because i'm allowed to oh you oh yeah you like to spend david i can tell there we go spam and step three okay moving on step three it seems like oh will our homework be checked daniel daniel is yes we actually manually check all of the homework yes yes we and we love it no honestly it's actually a lot of work we love connecting with all of you that way um we have sometimes like last week oh god how many hundred of them we had to go through but now we manually check all the homework yeah yes red diamond spammer oh uh uh jenya when the csv is not working when you try to open it um make sure that depending i don't know what system you're on or what os or anything like that um you might want to just open it in a any kind of like a text reader or document reader or something like that yeah yes felipe manually because we have to we have to check your work we have to actually look at them that's totally true yes you are making a token for db admin megan that is correct and yes preom you can use a token from last session that's i'm glad you asked that question when you create these tokens until you delete them they exist indefinitely and the point of that is if you think about you're going to create a token and you're going to you're going to link your app right you're going to set that into your app's environment to then talk to the database so you don't probably want those kind of you know timing out every day or or something like that so it's up to you you have to ensure that from a security standpoint this is another reason why we say don't put your tokens out in the open right you don't want those out in the open you want to keep them secret secret but yes they will last indefinitely um but you could always create new tokens and you can always delete tokens so no big deal there all right i see a lot of oh yeah yesterday yeah that was you know what was interesting is that was all the others on the front end piece and and we kind of hit it hard the back end was fine but the team has addressed that by the way that should not be an issue again yes okay um all right i saw a lot of thumbs up wonderful okay so moving on now to step three so here's where we're going to start talking about the the apis but before we do davey yeah i need yeah i know you want to move so fast cedric's going to talk about apis before we get into the exercise exactly i'm the slide guy you know give me a bunch of slide please but you know next week i won't be the slight guy i would be you know doing more stuff oh raul real quick i want to answer this because i'll address it can you discuss how you store these tokens securely outside of demo apps yes um later on when we get to we're not going to really address it today in the next part of the series when we get to next week and the week after with the tick tock and netflix apps you're going to be using a platform called netlify um this is netifying in having a service like this is where you can store those types of tokens securely in the framework in the in the service itself that way you do not have to expose them directly to the application where they can be seen or anything like that so it's actually very easy to take the i'm going to i'll mention it later but when we go to set up our to-do app we're going to create a dot env file an environment file all of those values later on not not this not today but later on in the series you're going to see how those then get injected up into a service like nullify where we're actually hosting our app and store them securely so we will talk about that coming up exactly so um we you just created the database all together using the web ui and we do have the database now human has the question how do we interact with the database you know the default behavior is to use the drivers maybe you have used some relational database or you need a dedicated library that we know the binary the binary protocol and the binary way to interact with the database and you know it can be pretty cumbersome to to learn about multiple drivers so what we would like to do is on top of the database provide an api so what is an api an api it's uh i mean it stands for application programming interface and it will list the operation that developer can use it's simple as that and so rest api are a way to invoke operation and method using http format http verb get put post delete those are the default uh methods in the ver in the http world using that to create things update things and delete things in the database instead of having to learn cql or way to interact with database we will stick to api and api work on http and interact with json format and jiva json okay javascript object notation javascript love json because when you load a json javascript will know out of the box uh how to map that as an object and start working with that that's really the default data structures for json so instead of having us to learn about cql sql how to interact with the database we would like to have an api and you know if you do have a little of experience in the front end you know that front-end 100 front-end guys doing react create component and you do have another team or more advanced user called the full stack the guy that will implement an api for you you as a front-end developer to interact with and these full stack developers have multiple technical choice they can build the back end in java or even or javascript or anything they like but it can be different from the front end because it's not the same runtime today is all about javascript so if you would like to build an api using javascript you will probably use a framework called express but guess what this is not what we will do today today we will use an api that's provided out of the box by astra so astra db just the database you created it's not only the database voltor saw a set of api to interact with the database you don't have to implement a backend yourself and i think i'm done with the api uh just stating that this api layer in a strategy is something we call stargate and it's open source so it's not only inside astraliby if you know somebody who using cassandra just told them about the stargate to create these apis for you and with that i think we can move to this api how does it work baby can you make a sedan alright let's let's find out now if you could cedric could you do me a favor could you go back a slide go to where you have um the get put post that kind of deal yes yes if you don't mind yeah you can sell the pictures that get this blue is green get this blue right what is this ui what is riya what is swag girl david what is swagger yeah so swagger swagger is actually a really nice um really nice capability that no from stargate and cassandra we are actually providing this for you but it provides a nice res api web-based interface that you can use to then interact in this case with our cassandra database or astra database right and what i really want to point out is notice on centric slide there on the left under rest api where it says use http format methods and verbs things like get post put delete so what this is really talking about are what you know what we call crud right create read update and delete when i want to change things that are in the database to then reflect the state of my application maybe i want to add something maybe i want to update something i've already added maybe i need to delete something maybe i need to read something right so it's these four basic methods that pretty much any time you're interacting with the database you're going to need so you're going to find that these are exposed right these these types of methods are exposed here in in in http with things like get post put and delete and those roughly translate get is read right um post is create put is update and delete is delete now don't ask me why you know they're just i realize that you're like why aren't they the same words you know this is what happens that's standard it came out 20 years ago right so um so i i think hopefully those words will make sense you know kind of where they come into play um and the reason why i want to point them out and the reason why i asked cedric to show that is now when we go into the swagger ui as cedric was mentioning you'll see these different color icons in swagger and you'll see those same words are being used and that helps you kind of identify what kind of method we're talking about all right so let me go ahead and share my screen again all right there you go ryan i gave you my screen i got it all right so now now cows are pretty cool red diamond cows are pretty cool all right so now we're going now we're going to step three i'm gonna spam it again because it's fun and again if you remember what ryan and um cedric were doing uh previously in particular i think cedric in your codepen stuff you had you were calling storage right a storage method and all that storage was just local so as he was making changes to his application state changes they were just being stored local right there there was no backing database and this is we're going to start to kind of build up the knowledge of what these apis are what to do with them and then how we can tie the database in okay so going now to step three now if we go back again i'm gonna go through the steps i'm gonna bring you through them slowly but they are all here self-service for you um so if we go back to our astra uh ui and if you're not already there if you're not in the dashboard you can click on dashboard and we built this to do's workshop right so i'm gonna click on that i'm going to click on the database that we're working with today and then within there i want to go to connect so the connect tab here up top and then we're using a rest api now notice there are multiple apis here there's document there's graphql that's fine we're going to address those in later sessions in this series but today it's rest so we're going to click on the rest api and then you want to go down to where it says launching swagger this link is your link this is endpoint that is generated specifically for you now this is again one of those areas where you want to right click and say open and link in a new tab or middle click just put it in another tab that's really what it comes down to you should see something that looks like this yeah jacob the graphql stuff is coming in the third week i believe yeah yeah with the netflix club all right so you should see something like this so that's pretty much what the instructions here are doing now if we're at step 3b then what we want to do the first thing we want to do is create a table right we want to work with our rest api via swagger to create a table now admittedly there's a lot going on in swagger so so you know what you want to do is you want to find schema so i'm going to scroll myself down to the schemas section right now something clear our something i want to be real clear about notice how you see these v1 there's also v2 right the the version we're going to use for everything we do today today are going to be the v2 versions right so that's important when you go to this next piece okay so notice here v2 and it's create a table so i'm going to look for create a table now you could just search you know you could be smarter i'm going to scroll down and kind of find it there we go okay here it is create a table notice it's v2 schema key spaces key space name so something cool about rust by the way and we're going to get into this a little bit more later this is actually exposing an endpoint that is accessible to your applications i'm going to show you where that comes in in play later but you can literally once you have the full url of this you can actually execute those those cred commands those create read update and delete with nothing but a uri like this that you just build up i don't have to download code i don't have to have a library installed that i interact with or anything i can literally just access these types of commands these methods right through um the endpoint uri and so like i said we're gonna we're gonna play with that today so again make sure that you're in v2 schemas key spaces key space name and tables create a table let's see now once you're here you're not gonna be able to do anything here until you hit try it out you need to click on try it out now remember that token that i said download the csv you're going to need it later that's what i was talking about right so you want there's three values in that csv you want the very last one it starts with astra cs right so if i go whoopsie if i go to here they are very long right so notice that it starts with astro cs like this right so again that is out of the three values in your csv that's going to be the last value there you want that token that's what you're putting in here where it says extra sander token that this is the token this is how you're going to authorize or um become authorized so when you go to use the api this token will give you that authorization layer otherwise you won't be able to do anything now the key space name i have put that in here remember we created this earlier it's to do's so i'm going to go ahead and say to do's right and then the body now in this case we're actually going to use some json and i don't some of you may have these widgets you can just click the little widget here to copy this or you can highlight the whole thing you want the whole thing right now a couple things i want to point out about what's going on here so this is just a table definition um and if you think about it when we create a table um well we need to know things like what columns do i have in the table what are their names what are their types is there a key so on and so forth that's all we're defining here right so if i take a look i keep fat finger in that if we take a look you'll see the name of the table is going to be rest for me read me by id right and some column definitions okay i'm going to have a column called id i'm gonna have another one oh yeah called text another one called key right so on and so forth what are their types okay i want to use a uuid for my id for text it's text you know for completed right that's a boolean so we're just defining what the table is going to be here now what i'm going to do is i want to replace this and i think i hear a question from cedric and let me just do this real fast i'm going to replace what was in the default body with the code that i copied from here right and then once i do that i'm going to hit execute and if all is working well i should get a code 201 that says created right and it's telling me right here that i've created a table called rest from readme by id hey david could we uh zoom in to the page yes we can is that what you're going to say yeah something like that yeah just sorry about that i am wearing small red earbuds yes yes i am yeah right there right there yeah so yeah as a matter of fact if you get done with that um right there give us a thumbs up right let us know that you've created the table with your swagger ui oh dion if you if you use version one no big deal um just go ahead and go find the proper one and reapply the command yeah yes press execute megan yes absolutely so once you get to the point um once you get to the point where you filled the all out you filled out your token your key space name and the body press execute wonderful and you should see now something else i want to point out for your homework especially in the homework we're only asking you provide the end screen shot up the full thing you don't have to provide screenshots for every single step of all the things we're doing just at the very end because in order to get to end you kind of have to have done all the things before so we know but do us a big favor notice hear in swagger in the curl command this is the command under the hood that's actually being issued to issue this it has your token so don't don't paste this in don't post these because your token is sitting there in the open i just want to point that out last thing i want to show you here notice the request url this to me is actually really cool i love the fact that swagger does this because sometimes it can feel a little abstract like what endpoint are you talking about what's the url this is what i'm talking about right here right so notice i have this endpoint that's been generated for me from data stacks but from the rest of it right then this is the endpoint this is how i access creating a table could i do this for my application code absolutely right and a matter of fact that's exactly what we do in code so when you start up the to-do app the real one um it actually executes against this very end point to then create my table dynamically right so it's a really neat way that again i don't have to even um import a library i don't need any like special classes or anything like that i can literally just call this endpoint and you know pass pass these values in all right all right good so i'm seeing thumbs up it looks like folks are getting there i do see siddharth with a 500 error um oh yeah uh niha postman is different from swagger so postman you know swagger is going to provide you with all those rest end points right i don't know cedric you're going to have more that you want to say on this um where uh yes postman is you know it's it's not a web app right postman is an application that you download and then you can configure to do very similar things but it's also not limited to rest yeah cedric do you have more you want yes yes exactly so swagger has really generated a http web web ui for generated client web ui based on the api specification so you use swagger close to your api each time you add a new endpoint swagger ui will be updated with the new endpoint and you do have this ready to go client postman is a thick client that you will an app not the mobile you know it's just the app that you need to install on your machine and you can also shape create some queries to do the same so yeah those are pretty close and you know at some points somebody created post women which is postman in a web version it should be probably in the middle of those two tools yeah by the way i noticed that somebody had a 400 error right um if you have a bad request or unauthorized i invalidated my key right so if you have a bad key or something like by a bad key maybe something that fat finger at a character wasn't in there um that could cause a 401 a 400 i'm i was thinking if i just mess up this you know what's funny it's actually i don't know if there's a layer of validation here cedric but it's not letting me execute when i invalidate the json that's funny um yeah yeah i same here um here we go so if your key space name is incorrect um then that would give you a bad request right because the key space does not exist so i would say take a look at the error message that it's giving you to make sure that you're good um if it is not to do's you may have created a key space if you created your own key space like if you missed the instruction and didn't put in to do's then you'd need to use that one all right so i see um a bunch of i saw a bunch of thumbs up so i'm going to go ahead and move on now to step four let's go ahead and do that so again i'm going to spam because i get to it's fun okay there it is step four step four okay nice all right so so now we've created a table wonderful we've created a table with a rest endpoint now let's put some data in the table right so this time um we're going to go to the data section right so if you think about it schema are the things that we're going to use to create our um our ddl or data definition language right the statements that like create table you know anything i'm going to create you know in you know the structures and stuff in the database it's in schema but when i want to work with data like i want to insert some data into a table now i'm going to go to the data section so by the way just a little hint copy your aster token because you're going to need it and now i'm going to go to data now again check out make sure that you're using v2 right we're going to find add row but v2 is the key thing so oh wait here's add row nope that's v1 i want add row v2 here it is right so now i want to add a row to the table we just created i need to try it out again i almost read it right i totally did that now again we give you the values right here so if you're like hey what's the key space name well it's to do's hey david we're getting a few requests for more zoom if you get to oh even even more on the swagger yeah all right so that technique zoom it in there that's that looks good all right yeah way better okay now remember we just created a table a moment ago called rest from readme by id right so this is the table that we now want to insert some data into so we're using our key we're using our key space name at to-do's and now i want to insert some data into the table we just created all right so now you'll notice this section says copy the following into the json body so i'm just giving you a row now let's take a look at this row when i oops when i copy that in there okay so just a couple things if you're wondering like where did this come from no i don't want that just that we want that exactly so if you remember when we created the table i said we had an id field right we had a completed boolean we had a text field we had a key so all we're doing is we have key value pairs here right here's the id here's my id here's completed here's a value here's some text that's the to do item itself um and no key here so now when i say execute i should get a response body 201 if that worked it's going to give me back the id of the data that it created so now i've inserted the row in there right i've inserted the row into my table what are we seeing a document id yeah just an id just an id just an id yeah and again notice the url here right notice our endpoint and you'll see this is the same thing i would access from my from my application now notice here by the way this is cool i can literally put the name of the table that i'm working with right it's through this end point i'm putting the name of the table that i'm working with um also i should have pointed this out before this is a post right this is going to be a post because i'm inserting some data into the database all right yep and now yep and if you get there give us a thumbs up let us know yeah if you're getting like a 404 or 401 it very well could be the wrong key space name or the wrong table name like if i invalidate this and take a look oh not found it should the errors are usually pretty descriptive they are okay okay yes rubber yes crab create post yeah exactly oh i look we've got some oh wait here it is yeah so i saw the falcon in here i could do that one with this hand but i can do nanu nanu from mindy morgan mindy for the sand [Laughter] i just went back to the 80s right there right the early 80s oh it's in token yeah if it says missing token then that tells me that um that tells me something is up with the token here um maybe it's not pasted in properly or if it's just missing it all together yeah yeah so thoughts have been satisfam uh has the same issue it's if it says unauthorized for operation you're probably missing the token in the uh yeah so if i were to take this unit and and do that then oh yeah funny enough it must yeah it's validating out it won't let me do it completely but if somehow let's say i miscopied the token then i would get something like that yes okay yeah i have to like force it on one hand to do with the other one okay so i saw a good amount of thumbs ups all righty so now we've created a table we inserted a row but now let's look at those values right so let's go to step five and by the way don't forget that this is all part of the homework right so if you're if you're a little behind or anything like that no big deal no big deal you can you can follow up at your own pace i want to make sure that we can um okay okay so we're going to go step five retrieving values now we created our table we added a row let's get the data back let's see the data we just put into the database and i want to point out this is using a get this time right we're going to retrieve and get it get um so now we want to go to um data again we're in the data section i'm going to pull out my key i need every single time that doesn't change okay um now i want to get i want to say retrieve all rows right i'm going to say retrieve all rows again v2 so let's see retrieve all rows ah retrieve all rows v2 open that up try it out can't forget that part i'm going to paste in my token i want to give it the key space name that we're working with the table name again we're giving these all right to you here in the instructions okay and there we go that's it that's all you need for this we're not doing a where clause or anything like that just i want everything from this particular table now i'm going to execute and boom ah look at that that's the data we inserted before so right there that's a nice verification because i go okay well in order to get that response i know that i have the correct key space i've got the correct table and i'm retrieving the row that we inserted before all right oh um the homework just to point that out um i'm gonna scroll up real fast the homework we have a homework section um the homework is to do essentially two things for this week um one is you wanna get to the end result of doing the to-do app i'm actually gonna demo that part but that'll be part of your homework um and then the other part is to do what ryan did in the beginning and create a react app from scratch using mpx so we will we provide all of that in here um you'll find all the links and everything are here in the repository okay so if you retrieve the rose can i get some thumbs up i want to get to this point get some thumbs up let us know you've done it cedric are you doing it with us yeah yeah are you really that's great no no i can't i know i need to get serious read the question read all the thumb up now we are doing great so this is five steps so you know let's move on let's move on yeah remember we need to play a little game in the end we do so i'm gonna get going on this next part here real fast um and then here's so for the rest of the thank you for the thumbs up awesome everybody so from six on from step six on i'm actually gonna show you something real fast with the to-do app so we can kind of bring things to end to end with this api then we're gonna get into some of the games when we are done at the two hours right and we'll go into the you know then the session is is over right and we're gonna do another hour added on to go into some q a and go further into the homework right that's totally optional it's totally up to you whether or not um you stay with us for that time right um but that's where we're going to get more into the rest of what's going on here um but for the time being i'm going to move on so this is all of this stuff from this this skip pod and all that it's all part of the homework and that's part of what i'm going to show you here right now so wonderful okay so what i've done here is i've kind of cheated because i already have things running and this is part of what you're going to see by the way when you get this running in gitpod right we're not going to do that part now we're just i'm just going to show to you and here's really what i want to point out right so for one um the first thing is if you remember ryan and cedric they were both talking about like react components and how you can dynamically update the dom right so you're you're able to dynamically update all the html and stuff on the page without having to refresh or do anything like that it just kind of injects it right into the page uh anyone here if you remember the days when we had to actively refresh the page in the header usually right you'd see these the page would just blink every second or something like that oh the days um we clearly don't need to do that anymore right javascript has made things uh a lot nicer um so what i want to show here though is this is similar to kind of what they were showing but now um we have a tie into the database right so if i add actually i should do fun ones like ryan did like okay we've already did we already take over the world uh i thought i failed and i had to get bread and eggs but if you want to take over the world we can do it okay i'll make sure to do that i'll make sure to do that so one thing i just want to point out then as we now start to build into the actual real to do app this is part again what you're going to do in the homework right um you should notice that as i add things like um totally get more milk and such right you'll see that what what i've done in code let me blow this up a little bit too make this a little see if i can't show you this so in the code and i actually found this really helpful to kind of track certain things um you know ryan talked a little bit about like state and props and such so what we've done is in a couple spots we've just added a little console log that just prints it out right that just printing out um to the console here that's what this is doing so anytime i make a proper state change react is going to update my page right um so i'm just like i said i'm just spitting these out in certain spots um so you can see some of those changes and you'll see this in the to-do app that you build right so you want to open up if you notice uh if i turn this off real quick in most browsers today you're going to have a more tools developer tools that's what we're looking at right that's all we're looking at um and what'll happen then is the the console when i turn on the console i'll see these proper state changes so as i add items here oh and um drink that milk right as i add items here you'll notice that i'm getting a state change right because i am now changing the state of the object that i'm working with as i add in more items and what's really cool is then react is taking that and is injecting it onto the page dynamically i don't have to do any more i don't have to actively refresh or anything you can really see that here i think cedric you were showing something similar if i then complete one of these tasks you can see right there boom it automatically makes that nice change right so you can see react is updating the page nice and dynamically that's really cool and each one of these kicks off a prop or a state change depending on what they are um so it's i found it kind of nice to play with this a little bit and you can kind of start to like dig into the objects and see what those look like now on the back end if i take a look this is actually getting a little bit more into that back and piece because i want to bring you into where this rest api um is is coming into play so when i am working on the back end um you're gonna see these calls being made let's say like when i want to create something right so every time i add an item i add a rest to do so every time i go here and i add something then i am calling this create this address to do now i'm going to just gloss over real quick this function thing and what's going on with that we are going to address that in the upcoming weeks here's what i really want to point out notice this create rest to do and then i have a function over here that's create rest to do notice this right here this should look really familiar right so what we're doing here this is us calling that rest endpoint it's the same thing swagger was doing right it's the same thing the difference though is you know where in swagger we have like fields for um the key space and our token and stuff that is all being supplied in the code here and such that's part of the body we're building up and such but the key thing i want to point out is we're calling that same exact rest endpoint so this is where we're able to use rest so every time i make some kind of change here in the to do app these are just crud operations i'm creating something i'm reading something every time i create something here create something here i'm also re-reading right i'm reading from the database to find out what the updated value is or maybe i want to delete something right um each one of those are then executing against those same rest apis that we were just working with with the swagger api right so that i just wanted to point that part out you're going to do this as part of the homework and i i really kind of impress upon you to experiment with that now one other thing i want to do and this is also going to be part of the homework so don't worry about um trying to find me or follow this is i'm going to check out something else we've added all right that should have worked now we have another update it's in the final branch of the to-do app now this one i'm going to turn some of this stuff off this one actually has a nice little console and what it does is every time you make some kind of update it actually gives you the full the full endpoint with where clause or anything right let's say what happens if i update something i'm going to update this by changing it to complete it so now you can see here's my path i'm using what method is it to put and here's the body it changed completed to true what happens if i uncomplete it right well here we go here's my path i'm using a put again for an update but notice my completed is false so you can kind of break it down and you can see how each of the different states is now being stored in the backend database using the rest api all right so again that's all part of the homework i just want to show you that part and with that cedric i think we're going to turn it back over to you uh yes maybe me or ryan don't let me yeah who's gonna do it who's gonna do it i think ryan will do the game yeah answering a question real quick oh curious to beat me to it thanks kirsten all right we are all in two questions so so guess what what to play the game right how to play the game you've got 10 minutes left so we're going to do a quick uh game using mendy.com um so if you go to mendy.com and open a new tab yep i'm totally playing it this time totally doing it all right i'm gonna get some music going too so i'm gonna let's see swoop that's the wrong one here we go and don't forget the code can you show the minty screen now and i post it in the chat as well let me get some music going as well so we're gonna do this game uh we're this is a game that you have the chance to win some swag the top three scorers will uh we'll get some swag uh so yeah go to mency.com enter the code that you see on the screen you can also scan the qr code with your phone and uh we'll get this started when you get into menu give us a thumbs up and uh we'll see your your input in um coming out of david's head that's a good place all right okay let's do it all right awesome so something to note uh the speed in answering the questions matters you get more points the faster you answer so make sure that you're paying attention to your phone or the tab that menti is opening and answering as quickly as you can when the questions come up the the stream has a bit of a delay so if you're watching the stream to know when the questions are coming up uh you'll be a little bit late so keep that in mind um let's see all right it sounds looks like we got a good amount of people in so i'm gonna get this started remember mentee.com and enter in this code five five seven nine six eight two oh should i play as well i want to win some swag hey you already have the spike i don't even have the swag yeah i asked oh yeah we don't get the swag do we know well you guys have the t-shirt i don't even have the t-shirt yeah i'm jealous i have a whole closet of t-shirts like this if you want something yeah get out my old one so we will ask you a question if you answer fast and correctly you get points the three fastest among you will get some swag which we will ship them all around the world uh also housekeeping please look at your tab or your phone and not the youtube stream because the youtube stream has a delay of one second so to be as fast as possible stay close to your phone or new tab just to have the question as fast as possible all right let's get started oh there's everyone i can put my name in what does h oh it that's misspelled html stand for high trading machine learning hugo thomas mark luke hypertext markup language or hippie markup to learn hippie hippie i haven't seen these questions no surprise everyone got that one correct hypertext markup language awesome wow that's actually awesome i don't think i've ever seen a result quite like that that's great take a look at our leaderboard fastest was ribbit okay who was the fastest oh actually it's a tie between ribbon and carl i think you might have an opportunity to change your name now if you uh we're stuck with the default yes i did get one but it's a very close game wow all right okay question two what is css not used for oh style and formatting of text storing data animations and transitions page layout and organization remember what is css not used for hey all right yes the majority got by correctly storing data css is not used for storing data it is for styling and animation so my question are too easy right everybody goodies no no i i think this is great actually because either folks already knew this or if they didn't um hopefully that means that they got the right information centric so nice job nice job okay okay let's do it and it was very information dense so there's like lots to remember so i think it's oh yeah yeah so many things all right roshan takes the lead jimin is in second jason in third but it's very close and it's now totally different from before that's just great all right question number three what is the name of the object tree updated by javascript the dom document object model the palm project object model the job javascript object model or the mom we all need that's a pretty good one oh don't put your answers in the in the um chat by the way make sure you put them in mendy yes the dom the document object model is correct a little bit tricky with the javascript object model can throw if you uh that is a tricky one right that seems like that could be a thing all right let's see what our leaderboard looks like all right who's the fastest looks like a moog was the fastest brings them up to second place with alex k in first and chad o'brien in third yeah man that was a that's a mix-up all right let's get to question four what is the name of the package manager for node npx mvn npm or you cannot call it it does not have a phone dad jokes for the win kill me yeah yeah sorry about that yeah next time you do the question ryan no i like it it's fine i love some of the answers in here in the chat it's funny all right yes npm is the package manager npx is the node package runner a little bit tricky all right see what a leaderboard looks like i'm going to beat cedric pablo is the fastest bringing them up to third place among is in first and roshan is in second awesome man it's been uh lots of mix-ups in this one yeah it's it's it's a tough competition it is competitive that's great to see so many so many move in the leatherboard all right question five what is astrodb it is a local in-memory version of cassandra it is cassandra as a service in the cloud with api it is an integrated development environment or ide it is a movie with leonardo dicaprio alright yes it is cassandra as a service in the cloud with api is correct correct all right you know i got to admit though we always have a solid amount of folks that answer it is a in memory local version or cassandra i feel like we need to do better on that maybe on our own because if people are coming away that way maybe we're not telling what they need to know perhaps that is true all right julian is the fastest brings them up to first place congratulations julian second is tarika and third is ronnie and it changes every single time yeah this would this one is the most change changey up game i've ever seen question six last question last chance see what it is how does react organize source code with react modules with react divisions with react components or with a filer file with a filler filler maybe all right with react components we'd already got that correct yes they are called components who breaks everything down react rolodex i think jacob just got we'll have to put that in there yeah that's a good that's a good option that's good that's a good one all right let's see our leaderboard for those who are in the top three get ready to screenshot your page your congratulations page because you'll need it to claim your swag so ronnie pam and jacob are our top three winners congratulations make sure you screenshot your uh your results and email them to jack.fryer datasacks.com we will put that in the chat and we'll also have a slide for it and you can claim your swag awesome congratulations to everybody congratulations to the winner it was not easy with so many people playing yeah for sure all right so we have a quick uh last question and we'll i'll just leave this up for you guys to answer a quick survey what do you like the most and what should we improve and while you guys are answering that we will finish up here with some some information so for those first second and third place winners on the comment quiz to claim your prize uh send an email with the screenshot of your mentee screen to jack dot friar at datastax.com and uh we'll get your swag sent to you and we shipped worldwide so it does not matter where you are we will get it to you yeah nice all right so homework we talked about a lot about homework uh and we've seen a lot of questions on how to submit homework so we have the um the issues tab in our um in our repo is where you're gonna submit it there's also a link uh in the repo in the in the homework section um if we can maybe can get a link to that uh oh i'm doing it same time thank you david and so yeah that in the in the repo is where we um list out all the things that you're gonna do for the homework and where you can submit them um but it is an issue on github and uh and we will uh address it you know in the coming week we will see all the homeworks coming in we're gonna grade them um we'll accept them and then you'll get the badge for each one of these um uh workshops in this in the summer series right so today was the to do app next week we're gonna do the tick tock clone and then the final week we're going to do the netflix clones you can get all those badges um and uh yeah so i guess if you do them all you can get the gold yeah if you do all of them you get the gold badge for the series uh full series so yeah when you go to the issues um tab of the repo there's a homework assignment you can click the get started button and then you're going to fill out the homework so some important things to get your badge you need to include your name and your email uh in the in the top part of that comment section um make sure not to include any of the brackets oh you can just uh replace the brackets with with your name uh we need that information to give you your badge so yeah sorry ryan one thing to point out i see a lot of questions coming in um there's no hard limit on when to submit the homework but we do it we do ask that you submit it within a week right um so that way you know because we get we do these every week and we do multiple sessions um and that way we get them in the time that we have focus to actually get through the homework so yeah do it within about a week sooner the better yeah definitely especially because if you're gonna continue on with us for the series you know you're gonna have homework next week and we have to grade that too sorry that's right for the homework uh oh that's a that is a spinning batch um that surprised me all right so due date is next week uh you're going to complete the hands-on you're gonna uh run the to do application in gatepod connected to astrodb and create a task and you can upload a screenshot for your homework for that also if you go through the uh the create react app from scratch using npx the steps there i suppose we need to drop a link to that repo as well i'll go ahead and do that so you can also do a a basic react app using our base react basics repo and uh and submit uh your result there as well we'd love to see what kind of customizations you make for your um list items or you know any component that you want them you want to make it be creative experiment um and we'd like to see the the small apps that you make for that um every all the information is found on the github repo like i said um and there are some optional videos that you can can watch as well learning more about html css yeah and javascript can react so we have a few learning paths that we just wanted to highlight so we have at academy.datasacks.com we have uh several certification courses that we offer um developer certification administrator certification and kate sandra certification this is all related to cassandra which is what astrodb is based on and if you have any interest in getting certified in cassandra this would be a great resource for you yes yes yes so coming up what's coming uh if you go to datasacks.com workshops you can see all the upcoming uh workshops that we have and you can sign up uh in the next few weeks obviously today and tomorrow we have uh the workshop you just watched which is the first week of the summer series on the 10th we have cassandra day india which is a full day of workshops and content for the for india market and then next week is a week two where we're going to be build building a tick tock clone um and we also have uh yeah same time on wednesdays and it will be a follow-up as today so next week we will focus more on node and the backend how to build the app yep and we'll be using uh another a different api we'll be using the document api next week and then i know someone was excited about graphql that is the third week we'll be using graphql api with the netflix all right uh another mention of our discord community um you know we've answered a lot of questions in the youtube chat when the workshop is over the chat goes away and we can't answer those questions so if you continue to have questions we can answer them in discord it's a growing community where we can continue chatting with you and helping you through any issues that you're having but you can go to dtsx.ioslash discord and join us there i'm gonna spam that as well awesome and finally uh we do these workshops every week and we have quite the backlog of different workshops on our youtube channel we can go watch them um we keep them around uh so this is just a small taste of all the content that we have and we are continuing to do these every week um even after the summer series is over we do them every week sometimes up to four times a week of different types of workshops so if you want to stay um enterprise of when we go live you can subscribe to our youtube channel that would be awesome um and also if you go to datasacks.com workshops where you can see the upcoming workshops that is a good resource as well so yep with that that is about it for our initial two hours we want to thank you so much for joining us um for those of you who uh are uh going to stick with us for some of the q a and kind of going through some of the homework um we'd love for you to stick around um but for those of you who have to call it at this point uh we just want to say thank you very much for joining us and hopefully that you learned a lot uh today and had a really good time i had a great time so thank you very much thank you same here this is wonderful great questions great energy um love all the thumbs up of folks going through the homework with us and uh we will see you well for those of you who are not sticking around we'll see you all next week for the next session all right and for those of you who are going to stick around i think we could take like a five minute break what do you guys think i could probably use a break uh a quick um quick couple minute break probably be good yeah how much time do we say five minutes and we're back yeah yeah so we'll come back in five minutes and then we'll start to do some q a and start going through the homework really we're gonna we're gonna sit down and do some of the homework um so if you wanna join us feel free otherwise we'll see you next week all right see you guys in five minutes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right hello welcome back everyone oh hold on do that it's music going all right i need to get some of my windows all moved around all right uh welcome back everyone uh gadam uh this part is still recorded so it will be available offline uh as well um let's see link to the workshop okay we can get the uh github link posted again okay you just answered kadam i see all right so here's the github link um again golden spinning badge yeah all the spinning badges it's uh i did not expect it to be spinning yeah that's right it was a joke you know it was a trap for you i don't know if you've all kind of figured out that we we tend to play jokes on each other with content sometimes yeah it's fun now it's coming the the video is coming just should be fine now by now nyan um by the way will we play the next week yeah right so as part of this series right then there's it's a three week series so this is week one and then yes next week same time um we do these on uh wednesdays and thursdays at the same time so you can come to either session but next week same time and then the week after uh so that's up to you yes alex asks a good question so we did that to do mostly with uh js and node.js uh there are other ways to achieve this is putting all this reactivity into javascript make it more responsive and is better practice so uh cedric gave an example early on uh of a basic to do app uh using just html css and javascript and it worked like you could add tasks you could uh check chests off and delete them just like normal the biggest thing that it was missing was a connection to a database where it can store that data so that you know when you refresh it it stays with you but that is certainly possible to make it straight in html css and javascript node.js and frameworks like react um give you a huge like initial step forward it it makes it's just ultimately easier to do complex things like maybe to do is not it's super complex but it wouldn't take much to start getting into things that are a lot more complex and frameworks like react and back ends like node help make that a lot easier uh adarshas what's the badge about uh so when you do homework we issue badges and you can use those badges um on social media like uh linkedin to show that you are continuing your learning um and you know not only that we also have the game uh you know after the three weeks the way to enter the game is really to have one of those badge and you get one chance to win some gift card we will redeem three 500 amazon gift card and now the more that you have the more chance you have to win and it's you know let me let me show that let's talk with everybody now on on okay so it's called summer serie game here it is yeah i should have shared that link before hey so here you know it's a google form and so if you get the badges you get some chance if you follow us on twitter youtube if you write a little blog post just to explain what you'll learn over the months uh right uh naman so um oh go ahead yeah uh namanas uh followed all the steps but end result is getting is not found if you want to specify what step you're getting that on yeah what step are you on and alamere yes you're using web front-end technologies for all of the apps that we're doing yep yep yeah and by the way i have one i have a question from shiva um in discord that i actually want to show on screen you mind if i share screen real quick go for it because this one's a really really wonderful question that may not be that obvious and i recognize that we we didn't call this part directly out so we should let me know when i'm sharing here there we go all right so now in in shiva i'm gonna i'm gonna kind of look to you there in discord um to give me a thumbs up or thumbs down or whatever if i've got the the question right so shiva went and was able to use swagger to execute and create the table and got the correct response right as we see here wonderful however then when they try to execute the end point directly they get this unauthorized for operation missing token here's why this is such a wonderful example so notice um in let me go to my swagger actually so notice in every case when we're issuing commands in the rest api with swagger we always have to provide this token and things like to do's and stuff like but the token is the key thing now what we didn't really talk about we glossed over is that this is actually being injected into the header of the actual um the command itself so notice if you look at this curl command so if you're not familiar with curl uh curl is a command that's mostly familiar with like linux and unix operating systems you could use it on mac um that you can use it to execute commands or issue commands against web addresses http addresses so notice that what's happening here notice i have my rest endpoint but also there's header information and one of those pieces is the token so you can't just going back to your screen if you try to just execute the endpoint it's going to fail without the header information that includes your authorization token that's exactly what that token's for this is such a great example because this is one of those cases where you would not want somebody to be able to just simply execute against your endpoint because then they could do whatever on your database right so this is where you need to provide that information in the header so what's interesting is you're like well how do i do that right well generally you're not just going to execute these out in the open you're going to do one of a couple things either one you're going to use something like swagger to kind of test things out or postman or whatever where you can then inject in things like the token in the um in the header or in your code right so something you know we didn't really talk about this either but in the code in the 2d app you're going to notice this this file called aster rust client and in it um this is actually where it's defining um the connection to the database in particular check this out this get asterisk client notice what's being passed right so we have this astrodb application token um now we haven't gotten to that part um and we haven't gotten to that part in the homework yet so this is actually for you to do um but what will happen is when you go through the homework you're gonna execute a command that's going to create and populate your env file notice this astrodb admin token that is your token so that is actually getting passed through into your your rest client here when you interact with the database and code right so you don't have to like do that manually let's see and stefano is saying um yeah yeah stefano's saying i think even if no headers require the browser to do a get anyway but i i believe you're correct i don't think it's it won't authenticate though um i believe you need the authentication token but i could be proven wrong on that one so hopefully shiva hopefully the answer is what was going on there um so really it's just that you can't you can't really execute them out in the open without including your token in the header right so um i could see where somebody would want to try to do this but yeah that's not going to work like that all right cool thanks uh ryan for giving me the screen yep let's see what else do we have um naman posted a screenshot in in discord i am looking at it right now um okay it looks like so you're installing the notify cli uh if you finish that and then run netlify dev that will probably be uh it's probably waiting for you for everything to install and you need to start running the server uh not found is probably because it's not running um oh wait that's a good one yeah no yeah alex alex alex oh you're gonna you're gonna answer alex okay yeah i mean um or the three of us to be honest but he made a good point you know we made it pretty clear at the uh even that the title that we will talk a lot about node.js and even if we talk a little bit what it is do do a do a slide in the end you know ryan after that npx just start the app right away and uh david i also the app running so maybe one of you can maybe show the structure of the project using a node so notice is the runtime so first you will use node to create the skeleton of your app then you can use node for dependency management you will have a package.json at the roof of your project and you will use npm so node package manager to download that now this is your runtime so based on the dependencies and target that you will find on package.json the dependencies this is what our app needs as third-party dependencies so here this is react but we can pick totally something else angular and view are the three most known ui framework but there are many of those then you see the script and you see some some config so with that you can do npm run start that will execute the script to start the app npm run build that will execute the stop to to script to run the app so it's really handling the full life cycle of the app when you're deaf packaging and it will also you know help you running yeah what else could i could i have missed ah i think it's uh i mean yeah it's a pretty good rundown of of node uh it's your you know it's your environment it handles all the uh yes it's it's you know it's a runtime so to access your code using http something you need something to listen about you know to listen the port to accept your request and render what you expect this is the role of the of the node runtime to be honest and to answer i know alex asks this question and as well as adarsh uh talking about react versus as you said vue and angular so they are all very good and they're all fairly popular react is the most popular um but that doesn't necessarily mean that it is the best personally i prefer react it's what i know the best um it makes they all have a little bit of a different um strategy in how to organize um their their code and and and how they're you know using you know react uses components and breaks everything down into smaller and smaller components and then builds it up view does something similar um but the way you implement them are a little bit different to me react makes the most sense um and it's what i know the best so that's what i typically use it does not mean that it is the best choice it does not mean it's the only choice um you know lots of people use vue lots of people use angular as far as what a developer should choose in 2021 uh any of the three really um i would say just based on on popularity it would be very good to know react um because odds are you're going to come across a project that uses it um but yeah yeah i would yeah vue seems to be simpler seems like now i do not use myself um and you know i also like react because react could be an entry point to move to mobile with the react natives starting with your react code you can transpose that to others platform yeah that's a good point react native is really uh really useful all right let's see his response is that what you're reading yeah plus plus one nice that's great yeah keep them coming alex yeah answering questions yeah please so um i guess i'll ask the question uh you know i did this i was using this to show what um cedric was talking about but this was our you know basic react app and component stuff are there any further like more in-depth questions that you have about this i know uh towards the end um we did actually i did want to point out someone commented this i don't know if liddy is still here but um this handle checking that i implemented is not as elegant as it should be um instead of this if statement we can just do uh set is checked to not is checked right and that's it that'll just toggle it between true and false way better than a if statement yes um peter oh i'm sorry i'm sorry you weren't quite done were you no i was pretty much done i just wanted to shout out liddy if they're still here uh about the really elegant solution that i implemented live uh but didn't do the most elegant way so i think i think you still have my screen up is that right ryan um i have mine up but i can put yours up would you mind so um so peter uh peter over in youtube i'm gonna say it's more rarity mori already um asks where's the commander generate the env file so what cedric said the touch.env is one way to do it you can just generate it but we're actually generating we're providing you a nice little helper command that generates the env for you so i'm gonna i'm gonna show you that here in just a moment i just have to wait for my git pod to hear me npm is downloading the world let's zoom in a little bit so you can see this node underscore module you know if you don't know about this folder soon you will you might need to zoom in i i did did i need to zoom in more you have to zoom in for each page chrome does it by tab this i mean it's small it looks small to me i'm just trying to help i totally zoomed in man is it still looks small are you serious zoomed in you know what here we are using git pod which is a you know ready to go vs code i don't think we add any extension and if you download vs code on your machine i mean really i don't think you need some extension uh to do what we we just show but you will have to install a node you know to get the npm command yeah um yeah kid pod is just an idea right but pretty powerful yeah it's basically vs code straight up just in the club yeah yeah yeah but it's also a docker machine so potentially you can click what you like in there and just just when in this ide you have everything you need to work with javascript but also java but also titan but also flutter you know there is a lot here that you can do with this id okay all right so for peter and then i see carrie carrie golin where do i find the database detail syntax for my region so i'm going to answer all these in one shot um so uh let me get my dog though the dog but i did not have him in the room if you heard that okay so let's go ahead and answer these in a shot so i've got the github up now so what i did is now by the way this what i'm just about to do um you know it applies whether you're doing github or if you're in your local vs code environment and i also saw i i know i saw somebody ask do you have this set up in the local vs code setup yes you should be able to follow the same exact instructions that are in the repo the key thing though if you're going to do this locally is up here in the prerequisites right this one make sure you've got node 15 and npm 7 or later i just realized i think it's in the link yes this page will show you how to do it um just make sure that you have these local and git pod we're doing this for you right so when you launch the git pod a matter of fact you may have noticed all of the mpm stuff where i'm downloading the world we're actually doing this for you in particular if you are if you want to know more about git pod i'll just tell you real quick when you use gitpod you can configure something that's dot getpod.yaml and then check this out i can tell it hey install stuff so this is upgrading my node this is upgrading my mpm to ensure i meet these prerequisites but again if you're doing this locally you just need to make sure you either have those versions or you can honestly steal this and just use it right you can just totally use that okay so going back to the questions about the uh database and such like that and how that's working then how are we generating the dot env file notice when i started a brand new instance i don't have a dot env file right now what cedric said is i could just do touch.env right i could say touch.env and i'll create a dot env file but it's going to be blank so what i my goal is in order to have my application be able to use the values in my.env to talk to my database i need some way to populate them now i could do it manually i think this is going what kerry was asking if i go to my astro ui and if i am in my database there's a couple different ways i can actually get like the region and stuff so let's say i'm at my dashboard and i go to my i just click on that database go to the the detail page like here well one i could copy the values i could say okay i'm in this region here's the cluster id uh that's a little manual that's not as nice i could go to the connect tab and i could say go to the rest api and guess what they're all provided for you right here however you still have to manually copy things right so here's what we've done for you in the repo if i scroll all the way down to the bottom and this gets to a question that somebody was asking about that dot env um you'll notice that after you start gitpod which is what i did here we tell you oh run this command here right this npm exec astra setup this is the database name this is the key space name what is it doing check this out so i'm going to copy that in i'll go ahead and i will run that uh yes now this command this aster setup yeah tell it okay yes it is actually going to then ask me well my key is probably stored let me see my key is probably cached because gitpod does that okay no it wants it good okay good so it's going to say hey give me your token right that's where that token comes into play yet again that's why you say you're going to need it later so you put your token in now it's actually talking to astra real time it just using your token it went in the back end api there's actually a back-end api and it went and it said okay i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna create a database called um to-do's workshop dp and you know i'm gonna check for a key space well guess what i already had one right because i i filed the instructions earlier and i created one there it is i created my two-days workshop db with the to-do's key space so all it's doing here it's checking and if it sees that it exists it's just gonna say great i have the information i need and then it generates the env for you so if you notice i now have a dot env file and it populated it automatically with all of my stuff so where i could go get that region manually if i wanted to i can use astro setup to do it for me you could use this with your own apps ask your setup is a public library right it's not something that's just like for this repo it's a really nice tool um so it does that part for you now if my database wasn't there it would have actually created it so if i were to go on if i do this and i say the yay db and my key space yay key space if those don't exist then it's gonna go oh look at that it's gonna say hey it's not it's not there yet go make it and if i come back into astra here now i have a new yeah database being created right so it will handle that for you it's a really like i said it's a really nice tool but then it'll take the values of that once it's done it'll inject them into my env file and then that's what my application is going to use if we go back over to cases like looking at the astro rest client um oh my bad where those values were coming into play i said i'm not finding it there we go weird oh oh wait i keep there it is there we go i was having a hard time finding that um so that's where these values this process.env it's grabbing from my.env file the values that match these variable names right those are the same names that you see here so that's that's that's the answer there is use the astra you use the um use the aster setup to generate the dot env connects the database does all the things um and then you can just move forward with your app so hopefully they answered all those questions i was trying to get a bunch at once oh oh nian the golden badge how do you achieve it you have to earn all three badges i want to go to bed yeah and it will be badges right from each of the weeks of the series and it will be granted automatically yes all right i'll stop talking for a minute no no i was reading the question only on youtube to be honest i'm just catching up on discord a bit uh adarsh yes the video is uh recorded and it will be available at the same link on youtube right after we're done um we also are doing this exact workshop tomorrow if you want to watch it live again yeah and for anybody who's with us and if you've come in late or if you've not done this before or whatever um even though throughout the repos we try to provide like step-by-step instructions for everything and explain things don't forget there's the slide deck in here i'm going to paste this at one person and if you missed that you really want to take a look at the slides because they go together right the slides go along with the repo the slides are going to give you um you know a lot of information and then the does that sometimes and then the repo is the are usually the exercises based off of the information you're finding in the slide so make sure you check those both out raj asks a good question about um helping understand the major difference between sql and nosql databases we have a workshop all about we do uh that we actually have a couple uh introduction to nosql kind of gives an overview of what nosql is and and how it differs from sql and then there we did have a workshop uh moving from sequel to nosql right did we do that once yes we do yeah we do have we do have this one yeah i have both where's where is raj is rajan discord or youtube yeah so i don't already get it yes so now i need to change the question for tomorrow or it will be there to win the swag i see you rather i see you oh which which raj for the links um let's see raj sarah okay and you said in youtube yep you got it all right so we'll send you links we have those workshops uh you can watch they're pre-recorded um but we do the uh introduction to nosql quite often so we might have a live workshop coming up there i just sent both links as well but very good question um akash asks is it just better to use get pod over vs code um [Music] i go first here's my is very useful and it's useful for like if you are not at your main machine and you need to make some edits to the code real quick or you are you know find yourself on a on a low power machine you can use git pod and it's in the in the cloud right it's super useful personally a lot of times i like to work locally and i use vs code essentially they are the same one is just in the cloud the other is local so i don't think you could really say one is better than the other all right that's my those are my two cents okay they don't have a page yeah yeah you know so i guess i'll put it like this i i usually i usually code locally first right um because you know while i love get pod and just to kind of second ryan said get pods actually really wonderful especially for these kind of events for doing these workshops it gives us a way that we can very quickly control all the libraries everything that are in there everybody gets like the same starting place right um and and so it's great for that but there are some things i i guess you know maybe it just being a kind of a cloud-based web-based ide that aren't always the best like for one when i start up my vs code pretty much it starts instantly i don't now mind you everything is running locally in my local machine and i have the resources for it but when i start something like ipod um depending on the repository and depending on what you're loading it might take a minute to load um you know and it at times it gets a little loaded but it's actually really nice in a lot of ways i found though that matter of fact is we found last night ryan that uh things don't always like in the preview um you'll notice in get pod there's a preview pane right so if i go ahead and did i run all the things let me run all the things um i did yeah i just need these two yeah so so when you and you can do this as well in like vs code but i found that when you go to start the app or a app um you can configure it to automatically generate and run in a preview pane which is actually really cool but the preview pane doesn't accept everything right it doesn't render everything identically in the way um that you might expect it to sometimes um and you might be thrown for a loop uh you might think there's something wrong in your code or something's going on when it's just something about the preview pane right so i would say i trust my local environment a little bit more from that standpoint um here's the preview pane i'm talking about in this case it's doing it's fine it's not doing anything bad um oh actually i'm not connected to my database um that's interesting uh check that out um but um but yeah i would so if you know six app doesn't won the other i guess um another thing that's actually nice about gitpod is that you can share it with your co-workers you can share cosp workspaces so if you have a saved workspace then somebody else can you can share them exactly what you're doing and they'll be in the same place as you as compared to local environments where you know how many libraries do you install over the course of a year and you might not really realize that you have some version of something somewhere that you haven't really remembered where in gitpod you're starting from scratch and building it up every time so again just yeah yes you know and it's still a web-based tool you know you need to have this uh correct bandwidth to use it and the feel the responsiveness of the ui is not as good as the local environment to me so and you know i'm all dude so i'm still using eclipse anyway so wow wow actually eclipse is really cool too yeah i know the the shortcuts so well though to do javascript i do vs code yeah um someone there was a question um yes so um never worked on react uh about regarding the the website design um you know for the website design we still reusing the the famous libraries and template over there you know twitter bootstrap or tailwind as you as you spot it when we build some react components we can reuse style from those frameworks we just adapt the behavior of the component based on user interaction and have some properties to use to keep the state but it's not really about web design but mostly about how to react hey on top of user interactions and the functionality um i'd like to point out that work says none of us look old and i'll take it yeah filters we we all use filters that's where we're also shiny right it's a little bit of a blur but we know yeah i'm hold all right all right what do you think what do you guys think um we want to see the dog i have two greyhounds actually they're x-racers both of them um um what do you guys think about do we want to i mean i know i was kind of showing the rest to do app thing do we want to go further into that piece or or what are you you know asking i'm gonna ask the chats um as far as like you know we're happy to we've got about 15 more minutes i'm happy to just like do q and a and stuff like that but as far as the homework do you want to see any of the steps or anything like that yeah and maybe i would have to sneak and drop a little bit sooner so maybe it's uh time for me just to thank everybody to join and hope to see you next week if you like the content consider to subscribe to the channel we will be there every week and this is that help us making the channel grow and still doing those sessions that's how we sneak out all right bye cedric et cetera let's see what do you let's see if you um uh sarah is saying screenshot thingy on the homework are you asking how to put in um how to submit the homework yeah honestly alex um i don't care what platform you use use whatever you want it doesn't need to be pod it could be local it could be whatever id you want yeah submit however you want c piloco thank you happy check uh i think it would be helpful to um uh do the that step seven um yeah it's pretty it's pretty straightforward i don't think it would take very long but it would give them an overview on like some of that you know the env file and astro setup and stuff i think you talked a little bit through it okay uh you know um you're good uh neuron i'm going to send a uh a link to our uh to the repo that it has the instructions for the react app part that we did uh and that's how you can do the um the react app part of the homework so i'll post it a couple times in the chat yes nyan we will uh we will be here tomorrow same time doing the same exact content right so to be very clear about that it's the same workshop that we did today um but if you want to come back that's totally up to you yeah absolutely okay let's see um i should probably share my screen again again if you want me to do that yep boom uh darsh you it's not certain that it gets its badges so if you complete the homework and for each one of these then you can get a badge for it and here to that why don't we look at that real fast to show you how to submit it um and and this is one of those things that's good to just start off at the beginning of the repo and kind of read through it um but you'll notice there is a homework section right in here with the last thing submit your homework here when you open that link that actually brings up an issue for you this is where you put your homework right you just fill out the stuff put your screenshots um and that's it right you submit that then we get it we get notified we'll be taking a look at them yeah yes we are still here salai we're totally still here all right so um let's see going back down to step seven then all right so if we finish off the homework here then the last thing we would do is opening git pod right um this by the way this usually only works if you're in chrome or firefox but since we don't need to copy a repo it's a hardcoded link you should be able to do this if you're i'm in brave actually um in safari they should work and when you do that you'll you'll see a link like this it'll it'll generate the app and everything um the first thing you want to do is you're just as you follow the instructions here and there's just a couple commands to run now we talked about the aster setup a little bit earlier i deleted my enb files so when you run this this is actually going to go and attempt to create a database and a key space by specific name again it uses your token you're going to need your token and then once that is done successfully or verifies that that exists it'll automatically create and prompt uh populate your env file so i deleted my dot env file notice i don't have it so if i go ahead and i run this command it's going to go ahead and go ah oops oh i hit enter too soon my bad i thought it wasn't going here we go so it should look something like this right and it's going to say hey put your database admin token here so i'm going to go ahead grab my token i'll paste it in now it's talking to the database it found everything it needed i found the database that found the key space so notice i now have a dot env file that just appeared it generated it and it populated it full of the values i need to authenticate against my database these values here these variables are going to be the ones that my application uses to talk all right so now i go to the next step so this install um the nullify cli what is that about we haven't really talked about nutify today and we're going to do more of that next week in the week after so nellify we use nullify is another platform um it's actually a service if you take a look at netlify.com you'll find them they're awesome they also have a free tier which is really generous netlify allows you to um push generate static sites give serverless functions all sorts of stuff uh stand and not just push static sites but push them over a global cdn like you can literally put your application up on netlify and it will become global completely on its own without you having to host web servers or anything like that right um so it's wonderful from um especially from any application development but like it's really meant for like jam stack um we'll talk more about that next week but i'm pointing it out now because you're my like well what is this netlify thing why do i have to install the cli and why am i saying netlify dev um and what's going on here is because this application and the following applications that we're going to do in the coming weeks are all set up to use netlify as a service then you get some nice cli command line interface commands like by dev and some others but then you can use to launch your app um to inject your environment into the the the uh the service um you know all like you can you can build it's really cool as you're like building your app every time you push back to say master or main it'll automatically deploy your new site all sorts of things right so there's a lot of coolness that comes with it um you know we just happen to use it here because you could actually take this to do app and totally deploy it up to netify right um but like i said we're going to do that in the coming weeks with the with the other apps so that's why the nullify piece is here um but anyway once you've done this last step by the way this is almost like npn run dev it just tied in with the netify piece so this is going to run my application development and you can see i have that going on here and there we go so one thing to notice is when you do your rest when you when you insert items to know this is working right they should persist because every time you insert something it's actually doing a read back from the database right if every time you go to do something here it just ends up empty that tells me it's not talking to the database and you should probably see a bunch of like 400s or 404s here um in your your output um so this i know that this is functioning properly and if i want to go one step further right what i can do is i can come back to astra i can go to oh which database i using to do's uh which one did i use it yeah it's this one so then i should there's a bunch of different ways i could do this matter of fact why don't we use swagger yeah let's just use swagger um i would need the correct name which is going to be to do's oh the table name i think it's rest yeah we call it rest there that's right yeah just rest so i should theoretically be able to do this and here they are right so notice here are the items that i've put in so i can see so i can i mean like i said i know that the interaction of this i know it's working i know it's talking in the database but if i really really really want to see it then i can go here um into swagger and i can see there's more milk if i want to do it another way by the way i could go into the cql console and i could actually just select this data right out now this one i'm doing here isn't really um in the instructions i just happen to know how to do it and there we go right so we can see the data is you know clearly in the database so that's this portion right and then the final piece is there's a final version of this so notice the branch i'm in is main this is fine by the way but we also have another branch called final um so if i check this out and say final now when you do this you do have to run a couple things matter of fact what should happen um is here there is a readme that's in here there we go there we go why is it that that's interesting my read me no that's really weird i'm a little thrown by that actually yeah that's this is correct what just happened here what is going on i've never that's a new one do you see that yeah that's hilarious uh interesting yeah so yeah so the actual readme is here though so what i'm gonna do is i'll just pop over here that was that yeah i've never seen getpod do that one before um but if i go to final okay so you'll notice there's a specific readme for the final branch um and if you copy these commands right by the way this rack scroll to bottom in the console feed they're just what we're using for that console output a screenshot is enough of darsh yeah you don't have to upload it or deploy it yeah screenshot's definitely enough so i'm just going to follow the commands here now something to point out you might be wondering why am i doing an npm install again didn't we already do that well when i switched branches i now have a different set of packages or libraries in my package.json right so the the packages that are here are a little bit different because we have a little bit more going on in this version of the to-do app so i do need to reinstall or install some of those um and that's what i'm doing with the notify piece yeah um yeah yeah please do the screenshot um hopefully you shh yeah it shouldn't take that long to spin up the github and do it yeah just make sure to take the screenshot at the end yeah we just need this control of the final not you know the day screenshots throughout uh and especially don't take screenshots of your key of your token remember that but yeah the final should be fine yeah the final is fine yeah yeah the final's fine um all right and then i'm gonna do my netflix dev again and now this time the app is still the to-do app that hasn't changed right the difference though will be in the console yeah so you're going to see this little console that shows up now right so if i kind of um just get rid of this so what the the purpose of this is it's actually going to more spell out what these rest endpoints look like it's going to tell you what method they're using um it's also going to let you kind of um you know dig into the objects right so you can you can start looking at um the the underlying objects as i you know for the items themselves um and then it's also going to respond like if i make an update if i change some value well now i've just done an update oh what kind of method is that here's the end point right what is the body that just got passed to it and such so it's a way that you can use to kind of experiment and see what various things might look like um same thing with the red x here if i delete something you'll see a delete so it's got each and an example of each is what it comes down to um so that's really the the piece with the console on it that's in the final branch um it's just got a this is the uh this thing that scrolls and does the console output um that is that that package i was talking about a couple of the extra ones this uh console feed console feed's actually really neat this is kind of a neat little thing literally allows you to take the console log output and just spit it right out into your uh your your web front end all right so that's it as far as that piece goes i know we've got two minutes left is there anything ryan we should kind of finish off with um i think that's pretty good there's any other questions last minute you can answer otherwise we've covered everything i'm checking discord see if anyone asks questions there stefano's in there oh one last thing one last thing we should point out if we come back over to our main branch um oh we need to remove your branch notice that yeah so the mpx mpx app this thing that says need a refresher on react basics boom that's here so that's where the mpx app is this it's a it's a different repo it's a separate repo you can just get back to the main by clicking on back to main but this you'll want to go to this repo and this will allow you to do what ryan did so you can start completely from scratch right with nothing and create a racked a app this way and and build it up from there i really suggest especially if you're new to react i really suggest taking a look at this um it kind of helps break it down and gives you that first experience and then you can use this mpx create react app to create your own right matter of fact to do app was created that way i believe netflix and tiktok were also created that way so it's a really nice command to use to get your get a react app react app going um adarsh the link if you go to the repo there is a homework section right there and you'll see here it says submit your homework here that link will provide you what you need to submit your homework and abdul in discord the code part is in step six i'll give you the link that opening git pod this is where you're gonna code go here there you go yeah alrighty i think i think that's about it all right well thank you everyone uh for joining us on this extra hour um yeah hopefully we were able to answer all of your questions and give you a little bit of a head start on the homework um yeah we really appreciate it hopefully you guys learned everything absolutely that you wanted to learn uh and we will see you next week for the second part of this series where we will do a tick tock clone and get into some document epi stuff so with that leave you on have a great rest of your week yeah absolutely if you have any questions you need help come reach out on discord we're totally there and we are more than willing to help and thank you everybody for sticking around we'll see you next week see ya all right see ya and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming
