    "text": "he started tonight with talking about blew me and terraform and some of that stuff and I am going to kind of run with what the topic that he was talking about I've dubbed my talk systemic deployments which is really talking about the complexities of deploying and managing distributed systems over the lifetime of the distribute system or the I really should say the systemic environment in which it is a part of because a lot of the tools out there do well let's talk about what distributed systems are first now I'm not saying they're there we go okay we had a whole bunch of different types of distributed systems these days some of the very notable ones are like kubernetes that's container management basically you know I'm paraphrasing a little bit we have like Cassandra which is a distributed database data stacks enterprise is built on top of that and then we have these pretty things without words like cosmos and DynamoDB cloud spanner Couchbase is kind of a distributed database but also a distribute cache then we have streaming with Kafka we have I mean this is just a few right I mean you go to any Wikipedia page where you type in distributed something distribute streaming distributed object store distributed database and you're doing it like a hundred open-source projects or some crazy number right there's a lot of stuff going on oh yeah ancef is object storage why do why do we use distributed systems yeah today it seems kind of obvious traditionally it hasn't always been but basically these three things and I'm gonna summarize the last 20 30 years the internet happened right I mean everything got huge we got way more data way more stuff than a little single computer or maybe a few computers connected together with like a database an app and something else could handle so we had to start scaling stuff out needless to say distributed systems are here to stay they are not going away I'm pretty sure things aren't gonna get simpler in that realm except in we just kind of abstract hide and push that stuff down right that's kind of like if you go back way back at one point we had punch cards and then we got assembly and assembly was easy compared to the punch cards right and then we got C and that was easy versus assembly but you know the the jump usually isn't always evident until we get there and right now we're kind of dealing with the distributive systems in various states like sometimes we're managing the whole cluster the whole thing and sometimes we're managing just starting it up but something's managing some parts but then part of it breaks and we have to figure out what the world's going on and we don't have control over it so then we manage it ourselves and we move back and forth between these things in the enterprise world the great world of enterprises they've really just started how should I put it kind of trusting the cloud in in some sense but they're starting to use a lot more distributed systems out in the cloud and they're starting to use some things like cosmos or DynamoDB but most enterprises want to manage that themselves for many different reasons so they have hybrid environments and they'll run like data stacks enterprise or maybe just Apache Cassandra and then they'll run I don't know some other distributed system on that and then they'll have spark and Kafka and a whole bunch of different things right so the enterprise has really jumped on board the whole open-source bandwagon largely I would say they have started pouring some money into that so that's good if you've been watching the Twitterverse and the realm out there there's been a little bit of a fuss about who pays for what with open source I think everybody feels but I think the enterprise companies that are getting huge advantage out of these things should fork up a little bit more money and and or at least people to work on these things give more leverage to people to say hey I want to work on this project because we use it for this I don't know multibillion-dollar thing that we do a lot of this stuff too has come out of the realm of startups where somebody sits down is like well I need I need a system to handle all of this data for instance great example pachi Cassandra the story there is you know people were hanging out at Facebook not hanging out I guess they were working at Facebook whatever you do at Facebook and clearly there was a data problem right they couldn't shove all the images they couldn't shove all the messages etc and like just some oracle box and buy another bigger oracle box every year and hope and pray that the thing was going to be big enough to do it that vertical scale wasn't happening so over the course of months years they started working on apache cassandra or what eventually became apache cassandra right and now it's used by tons of companies to handle that problem there's a lot of other things too like zookeeper you name it now now that all these companies are doing this though I see some companies they just like what's what would be the approach where they just seem to kind of like oh there's the target run they charge into it then I saw recently somebody said who would deploy Kafka and not monitor instrument or even like have a way to introspect what is going on with Kafka they're just hoping it does whatever it's supposed to do magically and there's a thread that has continued with that a lot of different resources about how to monitor this thing how to instrument this thing how to get observable observability into the Kafka cluster that they have and I apologize if I'm saying that wrong and it's driving you crazy I always tend to say words wrong a lot so that's one side of things and then there's the other side where it seems like oh look a WS build a thing deployed and it works I mean of course they don't always happen but you know it tends to happen like they just released do you remember what it is anybody remember what they just released well I guess it's invent reinvent write so there's a million things but yeah I was thinking a firecracker like that's the open source lambda right and they just release that and it's the biggest thing on github all of a sudden as far as immediate attention I'm sure there's other bigger projects still but they got 2,000 people following it already on the what do you do you favorite or whatever you do you click the button and you get all you get bombarded with all the emails right yeah yeah you watch it that's what it is and github just added a feature where you could be mailed only on versioned releases that's only been needed for like I don't know as long as yet hub is existed so anyway you got these enterprises you had these smaller businesses you get some companies that seem to be able to deploy these things magically and they just work and then other companies are like okay we have zookeeper and Kafka and we don't have instrumentation in this how do we manage all this stuff so the root of that is they start out with like installations right they just use a wizard or they use a CLI and that is the root or starting point of every deployment of any type of distributed system right because you need at least a node to start with to then attach other things to and like what Apache Cassandra you have choices in that simple starting installation write binary build a repo like apt-get you go out there and you get a secure thing out of the Debian repo fortunately not like NPM where you might go get a thing and then you get your crypto stolen and then your poor that'd be horrible hey oh there it goes so like it's it's pretty easy to go out and get a node of say Cassandra running right I got shot this little video and with a minute within a minute I've gone out and gotten a secure good binary build of it from app get started it check that it's there right because you want to make sure everything just worked and then I stopped it real easy to do but then that once you get past that everything kind of gets a little fuzzy right like what a patchy Cassandra you have nodes and a cluster right but then in Kafka what do you have do you really have nodes or do you have brokers all right this verbage even different in the deployment of these different systems sorry if I just turn your sound off I just said on that but as you can see this super easy right it didn't take much time at all I didn't even run into a Python issue because pythons not used to do this I have feelings about Python sometimes especially when it doesn't work which is regularly and then there's other very powerful ways that give you the facade of deploying all the nodes or say the Kafka broker's out to do whatever the job is and this is nice to get started with yeah okay so I'm a little hesitant because I don't know how videos work in keynote like this right here is you can in azure they have this thing where you can just start a test-drive of data stacks enterprise and you knew this with tons of other stuff too right they have I don't know how many things in the marketplace and also GCP has this the other one you know the Amazon has this blah blah blah all the cloud providers have some type of marketplace and what this does is it deploys out an entire cluster of data stacks enterprise with graph and analytics and all this stuff that if you took a step back you know I showed that little chart there that showed what is in it you go whoa this is a lot of stuff happening all at once right and it's handled it's simply handled you get out there boom I have a three node cluster and that happened in like just a couple minutes I cut out like a minute of waiting for it to start but you know just a couple minutes and you have a full-blown cluster with a test drive Azure does it for like three hours and I mean I don't even know how they charge you because like I hope I don't get like $1,000 built into the month but they leave it up for three hours and they kill it and it actually kills the resources it's really neat to be able to just kind of work with it and then throw it away and then work with a new one so that's that's what some of the ways to start with a distributed system right and when you start that way that's all great and eventually you end up needing something like well you need to manage that right in the enterprise you have X number of resources or you have an IT department let's say and this is where things start to get super tricky the simple stuff goes away now if you can go in and click a few buttons in your enterprise and they have something magically Wow them together that's great but that usually doesn't happen you have to go through processes or the IT department has to give you resources and all that jazz and that's where something like terraform comes in super handy but you also have to be extremely careful if you're using terraform to deploy let's say you need a hundred web servers ok and you're like all right I designate my resource in terraform and somebody was mentioning that you can there's a way that you can go through it there's actually a property on resources in terraform that's count and the count does a four loop on that thing now you need to set up data structures like a map that will give it its ID and other unique characteristics that it's going to need on that resource right so you have to have enough items in that map to step through and then when you give the count it'll step through and you give it the VAR dot whatever bracket something for the index body I forget exactly what the syntax is but basically it'll go through and it's doing a for loop on it and it'll go through that map array of all the values and it'll put those values in okay super awesome when all you need is just a bunch of basically rudimentary instances so you get to your hundred web servers and they're all stateless that's great you can blow them away you can you can you know riad sum whatever you need to do and it's not going to affect the other ones that are out there right so you can take away 20 you can add 50 whatever you need to do that's great however if you say you're going to create a HBase cluster or heaven forbid a zookeeper cluster okay you go out and terraform and you do that every single time you run that it will attempt to recreate the entire cluster and wire it all together again so terraform works on the premise of immutable infrastructure and you can think of that in the same way that you think about like in functional programming or something like that where you have an immutable you you assign you set up a variable and it's immutable at that point you use it as the value that it is right if you want something else you create something else from that and then garbage collection or whatever depending on your language it eventually gets rid of it terraform is kind of doing the same thing it works on the premise that every time it does a deployment it wants to change the state the immutable state of a systemic environment to the new immutable state of the systemic environment so if this can't be additive Lee added to like if it has to do an update to something it's going to destroy the old thing and add the new thing right as a completely new immutable thing and it's that state to state point which gets tricky so then you have to go back out and say like oh I'm going to write some bash stuff I'm going to use something else to build out the cluster etc etc and that's where the maintenance thing just becomes super troublesome and I have some suggestions some ideas about how to make that better I don't have any like convention based verbatim stuff like do it this way forever and it always worked this is very cloudy oh geez they use that word very cloudy space we're moving into when it comes to maintenance so like I was just saying if you use terraform to dynamically create stuff with a zookeeper cluster it'll create that cluster and then will recreate it every single time so what you have to do is you have to say this is node Frank this is node Sally this is node flower this is node pizza whatever you have to give it a unique name and create however many nodes you want to begin with with zookeeper the math on that is 2n plus 1 at least they tell you it is three nodes is kind of you you kind of in risky space zookeeper is a little fussy like if a node goes down sometimes it takes a while for it to go down and it to redetermination how to rear epic eight the data between whatever the remaining nodes are so my suggestion is use five or more with zookeeper okay when you get five out there you give them that static name and everything they get their IPs and whatever and you get them all mapped together correctly or add it whatever you do join this together into the zookeeper cluster then you're good you're running terraform will know since you've statically designated all those it can look at the state and say well Frank and Sally and flower and pizza and whoever are still there I don't have to destroy them because none of the things that are key like their name or IP or unique identifiers are changing none of those things are changing so I can just leave those and then do whatever actual changes are additive things to the infrastructure that you've asked for you've added to the files I can do those now you know I'll show you some of that in just a second but hugely important with distributed systems when you're using something like terraform or even something Anza Bowl is kind of immutable infrastructure oriented I'm trying thinking that other one it's another one some of the even like with kubernetes right you write your gamal you say I want whatever stateless partitions set up that are going to change I'm gonna map these pods to them right and then I'm gonna put a distributed system on that what happens when a node goes down though kubernetes and the other distribute system whatever that is zookeeper or Cassandra or HBase or whatever is going to now try to both manage the loss of that resource right so like if you have Cassandra for instance it's going to rear epic eight back out to other nodes that are still available well kubernetes gonna say well here's a pod and when that starts to happen real quick all of a sudden you have this fight queue Bernays is like no no no no you here's a resource here's a resource and cassandra will be like no no I'm well I'm remarried replicating I don't need to rebalance and stuff I don't know oh crap now I'm rebalancing because I keep getting a node and then I'm not having the node and there's this conflict right they're both trying to manage that situation there is word that one day there will be operators and there will be this wonderful magic and we'll be able to have kubernetes intelligently manage with Cassandra or with zookeeper or whatever and it won't fight with the thing alright and some operators are out there for I think like confluent confluence kind of fluent what one of those words that company they have an operator right it's closed source operator but theoretically it works so they're distributed system doesn't conflict with kubernetes when they have it deployed out there to you know whatever environment they're working with for somebody also with Apache Cassandra there is ideally this two n plus one math and a lot of time just like that sample and Azure yes edger where it deployed those three nodes out there that's great for fun you can do a replication factor of two so if you lose one node everything's still great you can just keep working against it's not a big deal the database just handles it I still say five is better because if you lose two nodes your system is basically gonna throw errors at you and flake out when you have only three nodes and with the two n plus one so again I say five is better put five nodes out there for your cluster again Casca half the calf cast nature of Kafka two and plus one brokers I've seen the math there's some argument I still say bump it up get at least five out there stop going with the baseline of three I believe that so much that I made new math so I'm sure no one's gonna put that on a white paper real soon maybe I'll write one who knows but seriously two plus two and plus one that gives you the perfect number of nodes or brokers or whatever they want to name the thing for the particular system go with that so anyway who some of the some of the the fighting and frustration of going from oh look I got this easy little thing running I have a whole cluster I have a node I have whatever super easy to get started with a lot of this stuff and it immediately sometimes it'll get you into trouble because like let's say I'll pick on let's say Wahlstrom there's a company right Wahlstrom which sells luxury items at super cheap prices they just charge in with all this simple stuff they start building systems on it or building apps right and micro services or whatever they move their legacy monolith onto their micro Service web service WX a JMX export or a thing would you give whatever and then they immediately are start they start to run into problems as soon as they get load or whatever and there's like this heavy turn of problems that come up so that's that gap is not going away but there are things that I do myself practices I call them all sorts of stuff tips and tricks patterns and practices gotchas whatever and basically what it amounts to is checklist and I focus around two key things that I've named this and yet the you have to bear with me I just I use these words and they do tend to mean very specific things to me whenever I start to create checklists systemic coverage for instance right so anybody ever read systemic thinking the books on this stuff right so you know you make one change to let's say a city you just let's say we're gonna oh it's Seattle let's do something real smart like let's just say 3rd streets close nobody can go on it with any vehicle ever that would that wouldn't have any repercussions right yeah the city would just be obliterated like no one could get in and out of the city it probably takes three months to get out of the city everything would be just chaos the buses would be like lost down in the ferry and the ferry would crash into the dock it'd be horrible horrible there'd be all these systemic effects of that one change right well systemic coverage is what I think of as thinking around not just I've deployed zookeeper or Cassandra but I've deployed this resource of resources within my systemic environment right so I create checklists around that and then I've also dubbed this thing which I have another set of checklist inception onward and basically inception onward which is kind of what I've been talking about and what Travis talked about some is where yeah magic the forward movement of creating resources and state and having a point of view on those things and those things in their point of view out into the system or into the world of systems right the resources are basically just like what you would in terraform everything's a resource right it's either data or a resource and data eventually becomes a resource anyway and resources can be an instance in a cloud environment or it can be some a whole network or whatever there's a whole plethora of things that a resource can be basically anything that you need in a cloud environment or even in some situations of physical environment I even wrote some terraform to deploy stuff to RFID readers that would then manage RFID chips throughout like a port that was kind of RAD but you get the idea resources can be these virtual things or they can even be physical things out there kind of maps to what other companies and other things are called in this in the context of resources state is the same thing you start with something and then you want to change it to be this new state okay and then the perspective is what do those systems see and what do you see of those systems once you change that state I'll talk a little bit more about each of these three things in just a second oh there it is so like what terraform one of the one of the things he was gonna do and you're gonna see right here this is actually creating an entire systemic environment you'll see it's got some compute addresses that is starting to build out it's actually building out some networks it's got cider ranges for the network's blah blah blah the whole thing that you need to deploy out like a development environment a production environment respectively with nodes etc there's a bastion server there's actually a cluster that's being deployed out in this situation all of this is going on with terraform and when it is done you will have the immutable state of the described configuration right great tool for that here's one of the things where you don't particularly have a mutable state you can do tricky stuff and breach the concept of immutable infrastructure you can put bash scripts in there to run post execution or pre execution and that gets even trickier and compounds the situation of like we were talking about with the the kind of built-in looping and some of the built-in pseudo structures that they have for terraform itself you can I mean with bash bash is what the whole world is created on right I mean it's everywhere and everybody does everything with it so terraform can get super complex super fast at I mean it's it's a Cartesian product of complexity right it's just nuts so you have to be careful with that if you're using bash scripts minimal minimum keep it keep it as much in that immutable state to new state as you can possibly keep it in one of the ways around that to is like with GCP you have images AWS you have a Me's or a Mis or whatever you want to call them a sure you have I don't know are they just call them images I guess maybe still I love how each cloud provider likes to make up their names specifically for whatever even though it's just like the same thing but in each of those environments one of the best things you can do when you're going from state to state with terraform is bake your image as much as possible with all the things it needs right and and this is the same concept with like in kubernetes if you're using docker or rocket or whatever it is make sure you have an image that's mostly done and you don't have to run a bunch of post execution stuff because if you do that then you're adding layers to that onion right that container image and then you launch and you're like why is my container image 42 gigs I don't know why does it take 10 minutes to start well that's probably because there's a bunch of post execution stuff that shouldn't happen what yeah exactly right so there's a lot of things baked your images container images virtual machine images what are there or probably even the new micro images whatever it is a double yes just released the mic do they just cut they call bit micro vm's I think is what they were calling it which I saw somebody say like is it a micro VM it's just a small VM you know yeah I mean micro service has got dubbed I was like isn't that just web services that are smallish per domain weren't we doing that weren't we supposed to be doing that I don't know we the the industry does tend to chase its tail sometimes but you know you see how happy dogs are when they do that so we're happy to we're building stuff you know so the inception onward checklist though is whatever I'm using whether it's terraform whether it's ansible whether it's chef puppet one of those tools these are these are kind of my checklist for that tool can it do immutable can it deploy out immutable infrastructure is it going to perpetuate encourage or get people to build things and then mutate it a bunch I run 8000 bash scripts post facto of deployment right or is it going to let you trick yourself like with terraforming oh yeah check it out I deployed a 4,000 node Cassandra cluster oh wait I'm trying to run terraform apply again it's trying to recreate recreate a 4,000 oh - Cassandra cluster ah I mean you probably get fired if you did that but you know those are the types of things that you really have to be careful of but you have to you know you want to I always say keep your infrastructure as immutable as possible sure some things are gonna come up because things do change once you deploy it but your core bits your core pieces you want them to stay put like you deploy a network out there you want the network to be there you don't want it to tweak or mutate or freak out every 10 minutes so that's one thing stateful in the sense of kubernetes kubernetes is freaking awesome I love kubernetes but one of the things that it has hoped for but like some of the previous past platforms didn't do so well I remember I was working on Cloud Foundry 5223 years ago and it was really weird they said can you get react to run on Cloud Foundry as a data source I'm like yeah cool that's why wouldn't you be able to do that that's just it's just a distributed database I didn't think too hard obviously because then I worked on it flew Cloud Foundry initially can't speak for today and now it uses kubernetes and does whatever it wants to but initially in the early days basically the concept was in cloud founder you're deploying basically an application a vertical application traditionally built like what was it j2 j2ee yeah or asp.net right yeah sorry I was trying to be gentle when I when I said those but yeah like those you know you it's a vertically sliced app it's like it's it's tightly coupled to the database half the time right and you have a database in something like that's just one database with one node usually like Oracle or sequel server or maybe my sequel who knows with no relational integrity in it and then you have your app maybe middle tier right but it's a very vertical slice cloud founder was focused on making it super easy to deploy that right whether it's no js' java whatever so all of a sudden I'm trying to get react deployed out there I'm like oh I got a node deployed you know I did that first easy step thing right I was like install thingy have it out there and I'm like okay it's and so now I get Cloud Foundry to bind that in the app but then I'm like wait Cloud Foundry has no concept whatsoever of a multi node distributed system within Cloud Foundry itself right immediately became a problem I don't know if that ever got resolved but what has resolved it is like stateful sets kubernetes the promise of operators etc having the distributed system understand the distributed systems within it make it possible for something like kubernetes to actually have those systems out there to set up and deploy a change that then won't be destructive like Cloud Foundry used to if you deployed that one node and then the distributed system worked like it was supposed to and that node went down or something it what would recover nothing would recover this just it wasn't it wasn't a thing they even advertised that they can do a distributed system and like at that point is not really a thing but now with kubernetes that's becoming a possibility on container Tech which is a good thing um let's see here one of the one of the little demos I wanted to do here OOP I was going to deploy a plumie app no I'm kidding uh so here's here's this nope not on computers open display preferences mirror computer I think I did the dark theme on Mac now and like the mirror button is not wear them I don't know maybe it's just me I blame myself for now so yeah now you can see it yeah everybody see the text okay I hope so because that's huge now basic TF files this is basically the thing that I showed in the video earlier in the slide deck we're deployed out the entire environment and I have it where the Creator sh the bash script okay I have it set up where I use this very immutably but it's tricky and I'll show you this is however a great way to set up an environment and then basically hide this Creator sh script now mine is pretty simple because I wanted it to be I didn't want it to have like five thousand lines and not be representative of what I'm trying to do so you'll see I right here I start state right here this is its own little terraform project right it has its own little connection and then it has a state resource so the state resource is just a Google bucket multi-regional Google bucket and I enabled versioning because that helps when you're trying to debug your state and the only purpose of that and the only time it should run is once on the inception of my environment being created right and here's here's my connection with my secrets if you're wondering this files and interpolation it looks at the account that JSON file which is not in my repo it's outside in my secrets directory so I do that keeps all my secrets outside of it nice little way to do it and I just put it in west one west one is our local data center down in the dowels I always like to point that out because you know yeah local Cascadian bioregion data center probably completely destroying the environment but anyway so that creates the state and in my Creator dot sh bash shell here script I basically give the bucket a name and then this first part up here where it just looks in the state director it runs that it emits which goes out and grabs the providers it needs to work with Google yeah that's all it does for that and then once it does that it goes back out to the root where it starts to build out the current state that I want for my whole systemic environment so what I've done and why I only run this once is once this runs I have my initial starting state and I have something that's managing my statement so now other terraform developers IT people DevOps people whatever the title is I don't know but people that need to work with this can now all work with it out of a basically a git repo right or you can use source safe if you want to or not just use git it's cool so let's run that real quick I say real quick and take 10 minutes there we go so that's running and you saw that in the video earlier so it's gonna work on that for me right now see here where it says computed this is where that looping if you put count in the resource will mess you up with a distribute system and that's why in this particular situation I am getting my addresses I'm statically creating them so that I have a public and private one the public one will be an address that Google just gives to me whatever it is some public address that can be reachable via the Internet not that I'm opening it up at the exact moment this is AG moment and then the internal one is wait actually the internal one is one that it gives me and then the external one is something that I can designate okay or I just mix it up again anyway the resources are in there declared that way but the point is with a public and private address you can give it to that resource that you need to be static so when it creates each of those nodes at least the initial three it will create it and will not attempt to recreate it every single time that you run terraform apply when you do need to change from one state to a new state secret it's closed source no um let's here let's see you're in the node so really I mean the static is like I literally statically declare here's the Google compute address right and Google compute address so I have two ones internal and ones public so yeah the public one is the one it gives me because it has to look at its range that it has right and then it will assign one to it and internally I can use one of the internal subnet ranges right so here I just increment 10.10 dot 56.7 for each of the nodes so they just keep that address that that benefits me in two ways I get a core starting distributed system I have three nodes terraform won't try to change that every time now unless I specifically go in here and physically change some characteristic that will require it to destroy it and create a new one so like if I go in and change say machine type it's got to destroy that and give me a new one with the new machine type what I can do though which is super rad I can start with these three nodes and then I can create a module or let's not go there yet I could do these three nodes and then I could say here's a resource for what I want additional nodes to look like okay then I create the map set account and I iterate through and get a whole bunch of dynamic ones that then I can point back to and say like you need to go and join the cluster that's here's the IPS right I can point right at it because I know what it is so that's one way you can use the static part but then add as many as you need to as things change so you can kind of auto scale with terraform like if you wanted to put it into programmatic iteration right here's where things get tricky see I have an install CSH blah blah blah you can get into trouble there but all my install actually does is just install Cassandra yeah terraform goes from state to state right so if something happens in between it doesn't particularly know that something occurred so if a node goes down in the particular case of Cassandra I want Cassandra to deal with that right I want it to manage it now of course I'm gonna get to this in just second - as I as I slowly wrap up here you want to have instrumentation you want to have observability into what's happening right you want to be able to know when a node goes down so that yeah Cassandra might be handling putting putting the data back out to different nodes or whatnot to manage that that's down but you still want to know that this has occurred you want to understand if events are getting lost and all those things so those that's autonomous of this right so using a focused immutable infrastructure approach with terraform or whatever tool you're using kind of keeps the separation of concerns forced right like cassandra manages its nodes in its database right you as the manager of the systemic environment has various observable events metrics other things that you look at to manage that right so you take tertiary actions or you set up systems to take tertiary actions no not in tear form unless unless you were trying to do some wild automation stuff with terraform specifically in a weird dynamic kind of way but what I would suggest is using using the advantage of the built-in elements of the system the distributive system specifically to extend that right because terraform should have no insight into what zookeeper actually is or Cassandra or react or whatever right but like cassandra for instance there's various things out there like you could use the data sacks Enterprise Solution has all types of ways to look at and see what's actually happening with the actual cluster and set it up to say you know because it's more than just the nodes and you can say well if something disappears you want it to attempt to recreate that or grab another resource if a resource is available that is you might want to limit its resources so there's there's systems in place that would do that for you or you'd want to build something like say spark jobs to look at things like that if you're building a systemic environment but again that the core principle there is kind of trying to keep keep a separation of the concerns to the tool to do a specific job and also hashey Corp has some stuff too you can look at nomad we're like vault is there security secrets thing Nomad is there scheduler and there's some other things I'm spacing on what it is right now yeah exactly something like that so there's there's other tools that specifically handle like well what happens if this particular thing like a node disappears is does it know about its resources or not like how do we how do we get it to manage itself at that point um all right so what's your that should be oh yeah it's done it just this it just didn't run the bash scripts see there's that mutability problem causing issues but the the resources are there so if I out to Google and no wrong account sometimes I feel like I need a terraform implementation to manage me and my 900 billion different accounts for everything this is no I don't want that one my faster-faster-faster there we go anyway if we go out you can see the there's more clicks to this than I remember here we go okay so this is the dashboard but if you go out to the compute engine for instance you can see there it is my three nodes and my bastion server right and I also created way more than that as you saw those things go by I created some networks wherever the networks are VPC network oh yeah I keep forgetting who uses GCP anyway did you notice it used to be networks and then it became VPC networks I like that because everybody knows what a V PC is because of AWS meanwhile there's another cloud provider that calls it like virtual network and like is that different do I need to learn something different or is it like what's the context shift stop renaming stuff when it's when it's the same thing like if it's legitimately different okay but it's a network so anyway here's my dev net I had a dev net right here and I just put at East 1 and a West one I don't like to make myself too complicated I always leave the default stuff in there but basically that's what all that did and it gave me that initial state so now if I go in and let's say I don't know what I want to do let's say I don't like I don't like this node anymore which is oh no to address while it's a really boring name let's say that this is Frank node I don't like Frank node anymore so I'm gonna get rid of Frank so I've commented it out Frank and now if I go over here and run terraform plan it goes through and looks at yeah the existing state that I just built and says all right I found some changes based on what you just told me in your configuration that you want with what I know to be the existing state which is in that little bucket that Google bucket that I started with that initial terraform project and what I know terraform that is terraform speaking it has two things to add five to destroy I just deleted one thing oh no I didn't there's a whole bunch of stuff in there there was an eye the public private IP there is the actual resource itself and then there's the various network elements that were attached to it so that's why it needs to destroy five things but it needs to add two things because basically it's going to destroy two and probably recreate those two things that appear to be changed because the other thing needs to change because what it does is it creates the whole graph right of changes looks through that and determines what it needs to do and then you just tear form apply and it goes through does it again and you say yes uhm so that's that's terraform that's a great way to manage your environment but it is what did do something oh it's doing haha see it's tricky yes exactly I didn't read my plan the good thing this is only production yeah as I do this people in engineering like do do not give Adrian production control of anything please he just wiped out all that stuff but yeah so fun fun with terraform it's it's a great tool but like anything with distribute systems it's tricky you really got to watch out it's not like just destroy deploying not destroying deploying an app server and going okay I got the box it put some stuff on it now I'm ready to go that's great if you use it there that doesn't have a lot of implied complexity to it but the minute you start using these tools with distributed systems you got to think about the fact that you want to go from point of State to point of state and in between that the distribute system is going to do all sorts of whatever it is it's going to do to itself all right all that there's a little dot came up what did that do No somebody hacked my terminal all right so the last little bits here so in the sense of systemic coverage when you're building out a distributed system the questions you brought up key things here you want to be able to monitor maybe right you want insight into it somehow and you want to be to make observations about it and that is from way high up at the executive level all the way down to individual contributor level sorry I'm redoing it so I can look at all my notes so I remember to say everything there we go now you do want in this situation to very distinctively be able to have insight about what you want you want to be able to monitor it in a distributed systems environment there are some trains of thought that will say no monitoring isn't that big a deal you need just observing or something like that or whatever but when you're looking at a systemic environment you want all the data available to you you want all of the choices that you can have to you all the time because you need to be able to make decisions based on all of that stuff right because you need to be able to prove that the distributed system is working that the applications are running against it etc and you do want to be able to observe not just the systemic environment but the specific events occurring from the applications right I mean why else would you have a systemic environment I mean sure some people just want to run servers and stuff that's cool nothing wrong with that but at the end of the day a business is trying to do something or an organization is trying to do something and they want the apps and they want the services to work and the best way to know that your apps and services are working is through pretty intense observability which involves instrumenting your apps and really digging in like you need to know when the events are firing like sure the cpu load is up the ram is spiking are the events firing or are they not these are disparate things right maybe the resources are specked out like crazy and everything is working fine you need to be able to research these things independently of each other and trace into that if things are just sitting there idle on CPU and memory but all of a sudden your events aren't firing and the occurrences in the path that you need them to you need a trace into that so that's where monitoring comes in from one perspective and observability of the actual systems the individual pieces the individual resources comes in at another level and you need both to really be able to have insight and prove out that a system is in a particular state or not we're gonna say something you got a question well yes so monitoring generally when we get into the pedantic notion of what one of these things is or not or whatever so observability in a very rudimentary sentences more application focused or services focused right like within micro services you need very high cardinality data to be able to trace specifically in two things to look at what is actually occurring right and that's where you need to get in and you need to instrument the applications look at your methods when it fires it needs to tell your your observation system your observability system or what not it needs to put that data somewhere so that you can look through that data very quickly slice it and then get into the problem right this is almost like a debugging tool more than it is really a monitoring tool but you jump over here to monitoring and what it generally like when I'm saying monitoring in this context we're talking about liveness can you ping it from somewhere you know like can you ping it internally can you ping it externally can you get it from East Coast West Coast Eurasia whatever and then also metrics of the operating system like how many threads are running what else is running on the machine have I installed Wireshark has it sucked up all the memory and is it crashing my note every five minutes you know you want to know those types of things that's peripheral to your application right like your service or your your micro service isn't gonna go hey Wireshark to run in and eaten up all the memory that's not what you get out of that's complete breach of separation of concerns so and then the metrics of the apps very general sense like you look at the thread of the app running or the thread of the service on the machine or the container or the whatever and then you know apps services kind of same thing in this context but it's those higher resource level metrics that you're looking at versus inside the services in the apps themselves and then in the contest of tracing and distributed tracing open tracing your Phooey I hate one forget the name of something but is it Zipkin I think is what one of the solutions is out there cool I see heads nodding so I said it right so Zipkin is a super awesome one I've used it before I've looked at honeycombs too if you have distributed systems get this because holy moly it's super awesome like it actually gives you context of what's going on systemically not just from individual high cardinality point that's great but this might only you might only trace into one node like one little thing is happening on a node but this will give you more insight into what's happening all around and what's happening from node to node 2 node etc and as you add instrumentation that level of tracing becomes infinitely more useful and then I forget exactly we're saying but we're talking something about the context of like how do you how do you manage those things once you get it out there into a state right you add remove resources and that goes from state to new state but in between there let's say something goes down that's where you need effective reporting job runners or what's with schedule schedulers etc to be able to recreate resources or even decide to recreate resources like should it wait five minutes should it do something like in the context of the the future wonderful world of operators and kubernetes like let's say you I don't know let's say something decides that a node needs to go away in Apache Cassandra for maintenance ok well it'd be nice if kubernetes knew that that was gonna happen because otherwise kubernetes default response is like Oh a pod just got yanked out for some reason or this resource is gone I'll put it back that's awesome that's what kubernetes is supposed to do but in this particular context you want that to go away you want it to drain the data and then you want whatever to happen right I let's say you're gonna you're gonna recreate a new you're gonna destroy that node and recruit a new one that's patched or something right like that gets rid of the cryptocurrency bug who knows when you put it back you want to be able to re-edit let the data replicate back out appropriately and then take down the next node or something and then just go around it for like a maintenance reason right now kubernetes generally doesn't always know that if like a distributed system might be used that way but kubernetes wouldn't particularly know that but in the future it would and it would say oh I have logic around this I need to wait 10 minutes before I arbitrarily decide to put a resource back out there for that thing and by then usually you know you can do your patch or whatever and then pop it back in there so that is 99% my presentation the general gist is create these checklists around your infrastructure at the various levels think of it from time-based going forward and then think of it systemically and map it from that point of view create your checklist to map out from those two angles and you'll have a much better handle on what the particular environment is being used for what it's doing and whether you're getting good performance out of it or not trying to fight with them and I know some environments you're just you're kind of stuck with this where some of it might be immutable some of it might be mutable you might have some chef and some terraform and you might have Apache Cassandra and you might have HBase my head zookeeper you might have all of the things and the practices for managing those might differ and conflict with each other from the IT perspective but to really get that under control there needs to be agreement to move forward in the context of like in my opinion use an immutable infrastructure concept as the baseline and move forward from that perspective keep a view of the systemic environment don't let stuff start to be managed in some wonderfully bespoke artisanal handcrafted way that's nice but you know you only want to buy one $6,000 suit in your life I mean I guess maybe some if you have more if that's pocket change whatever but you get the premise like you don't want to just go out and like every server becomes your best friend because eventually it's going to get knocked right so that's my two cents on the whole matter create checklist think outwards and systemically questions and thoughts yeah yeah at the starting point in some ways you have to do that or they will be destroyed every single time so like it I'll just throw in and add this context so like that little three node cluster is really just like one right even though you have to name them uniquely and make sure that they're static because you don't want that to be recreated every time because it destroy the whole cluster wipe out your system and in the meantime your apps are flaking out or whatever because you can't recreate it every time you need that data to stay it needs to be not static but it needs to be stored and recoverable and new data needs to be added etc I mean it's a database right so you don't want that to get messed with yeah [Music] right so modules work in some ways but you also had to watch so modules will determine certain things are dynamic and even if you statically said like here's my five variables pass this into the module and create the resource well those five variables if therefore one of the key things like let's say the ID let's say you're passing that in it's statically passed in as the I mean you've given it the value right for that variable but when it's in the module the modules like I don't know if this is different every time so I'm going to assume it's different and it'll recreate the resource if it's a module so that's why I had to basically create the first three nodes as static resources in their place one of the things that you can use there's other tricks and ways to deal with this so like you can set up data and you can set up the mappings to be statically assigned to initial resources right so they've created and then terraform knows that they're not actually changing and it'll leave them alone and then you can just do the additive parts so it's again it's mostly you have to be aware of what terraform is actually going to do what it thinks it's going to do right right well that's that's where you use a module but you have to figure so we just pass in the configuration right yeah yeah okay cool um yeah you definitely need yeah you definitely you definitely need to be able to test it because even like AWS to gcpd to as your it's the behavior is gonna be slightly different I mean we got different people writing these providers right it's not like every central group committee that's going this is exactly how behavior needs to occur on clouds make it work this way and then of course they're writing the providers but then underneath like the azure teams are doing one thing the AWS teams are doing a different thing GCP teams are doing a different thing so the respective environments also underneath all that work differently so there's a lot of dynamic thought that's occurring that makes you really have to test out in each one so even if you're going multi cloud with terraform say you deploy out your three data centers you go and and I've done this where we have data stacks Enterprise Cassandra deployed out there and we have Asher with three nodes we have AWS with three nodes and GCP with three nodes okay and the the tricky thing is once it's out there I just let that let the data stacks enterprise stuff manage that because terraform can give me that initial state put all that stuff there and then that that's basically the end of its life like the terraform doesn't need to do anything else like I can scale up scale down add resources or whatever through the management suite of that so [Music] yeah and but test it though because sometimes terraform thinks like oh this is just random dynamic stuff and I need to recreate it all so it'll destroy a bunch of stuff and then you're going Oh crud it just wiped out my whole database so um so cool dot ellipses let's continue the conversation but I'm gonna say a few more things real quick if you're curious about go coding especially site reliability CLI type stuff I'm going to be twitch streaming slash YouTube streaming building out a whole go app this 29th and 30th which i think is thursday friday so it's pretty cool I'm gonna use the Twitter API pull out stuff out and I'm gonna end up dumping it in various export formats like JSON XML etc but also out into an Apache Cassandra cluster just for fun so if you're curious about go coding I'll be doing some of that I also write a blog about all sorts of topics there it is in this slide deck I will make available on the meetup website in the the resource list thingy whatever they call it on meetup I don't know they keep changing the name and stuff on there so that the slide deck will be there those videos that I do for that and the videos for this those will all be available or linked via the meetup site and also out at data stacks Academy so this talk and Travis's unbeknownst to him will be available there actually he knows he he knows now yeah his repo will be out there I've got a couple of repos - including that terraform one which you can go check out freebie you know it's open source I am NOT cryptocurrency mining or anything or stealing but you know I it doesn't really do much it just builds a few things but it's a great example to get started with some of the concepts that I've talked about especially like creating a checklist and going like alright so I build out assistance system environment now what are my next steps and there's all my info if you want this stuff it'll be on the link on Meetup so and I think everybody knows I have a Twitter account
