    "text": "[Music] there are at least two approaches that you can take to graph data modeling with the data driven approach you basically populate the graph and rely on dsc graph to generate the schema for you automatically as you load data this can be really useful if you have a completely representative data set want to get started quickly or prefer to think in terms of instance data instead of abstract schema on the flip side if you're more scientist than hacker then you may appreciate using a more formal data modeling framework where you will use a well-defined methodology to work through your conceptual logical and physical schema designs so let's talk about how you might go about defining your schema using a data-driven methodology the most important thing here is to ensure that you have a completely representative graph instance that accounts for all possible graph patterns including how vertices can be connected and what value properties might be assigned because remember when dc graph is automatically populating your schema it can only be as accurate as the example instance data that you're providing if you encounter data later on in the process that was not represented in your initial graph instance then it may not conform to the automatically generated schema now that might sound kind of complicated but we're going to work through an example data driven approach so you'll see how it all works these are the steps we're going to follow we'll start by drawing a picture to help us formulate our idea we'll create instance data and lastly we'll visualize that data to verify its correctness once we're reasonably confident that our instance data is good to go we'll take a look at the resulting graph schema and make the necessary customizations and optimizations so here you can see a diagram of an example instance graph in our case we're building this manually so our goal is to figure out the minimum amount of instance data necessary to completely represent the different things we'll see and just as an aside it's also common to utilize a pre-existing data set for this purpose so now that we know what our instance graph data should look like let's get to work creating and populating our dse graph instance the first thing we need to do is ensure that our graph is in development mode this tells dsc graph to automatically create underlying schema for any data that we write then we start by adding all of the vertices to our graph as shown here then we go ahead and add the edges that connect those vertices lastly we add a few additional properties as shown here now for my favorite part let's take a look at the graph to make sure that we're happy with how it all turned out data stack studio makes this really easy you can visualize your graphs to ensure that it matches the sketches you created earlier as you're inspecting your graph there are a few things you want to verify first you want to make sure you have all of your vertex and edge types represented you will want to verify that the cardinality of all your edge labels is correct as well as the domain and range for those edge labels which describes the vertex labels that the edge label can connect lastly you want to make sure that all of your properties are represented with all of the different types they may contain in the various possible cardinalities of each property type remember the automatically generated schema will only be as accurate as the example graph instance you provide so this step is critical so now that we are happy with our example graph it's time to extract our schema dse graph makes this really easy by using the schema describe method the output of schema described method is actually schema creation code that can be used to recreate the schema later you just copy and paste it into your application we'll take a look at it in pieces starting here with all the property keys most of this is pretty straightforward as our properties tend to be pretty simple but do take notice of one multiple cardinality designation on the production property key here you can see the schema generation code for our vertex labels looks good as well as the schema generation code for our edge labels also looking good at any point during this process it can be helpful to use the data stack studio schema view to see a visual representation of your schema feel free to check in on the fly this representation can also make it really easy to see errors or emissions in your schema that might not necessarily jump out at you when you're inspecting the code textual output of schema describe so what am i looking for when i'm inspecting the schema well i want to make sure that all of my vertex label and edge labels are represented that one's pretty obvious we'll also want to make sure that the edge label cardinalities look good now it's important to note that these probably won't be set correctly by dse graph as it defaults to multiple cardinality so if you need single cardinality you're going to need to set that explicitly and lastly we ensure that our property keys and data types and ttls are set correctly ttl is another field that you'll need to pay explicit attention to because dsc doesn't set that automatically for you you may have noticed that our automatically generated schema did not contain any partition key descriptions so one final step we need to work through here is defining the user-defined vertex ids this is the recommended approach for getting reliable performance while maintaining the ability to control graph partitioning additionally system generated vertex ids will be deprecated eventually let's go back to our vertex label schema creation code to introduce explicit definitions for the partition keys another important thing to recognize about this data driven approach to graph modeling is that it's still up to us to optimize the schema by introducing indexes that will satisfy our data access patterns now that you've learned all about data driven graph data modeling go check out the exercise and give it a shot for yourself",
