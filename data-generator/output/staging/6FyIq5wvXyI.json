food I am optically behind mo stood on a map on the costume like it no sir happen okay okay Sam Ash and yet oh sorry sorry [Music] ok let's get serious you may have heard that gas on hub is hard it is indeed different form a relational database not hard let me show you by building a REST API from the beginning and step by step let's go when you create an application the first things to do is to define your data model properly and there is a methodology for that the process is described with many details in data stacks Academy free courses but here I will give you another view to start with you will need both conceptual data model and application workflow from there it's all about applying basic rules to move to the physical data model let's see we reuse case in a ecommerce application we have an entity product with attributes and entity orders with some attributes both are related with a many-to-many relationship eventually having properties I will use this limited scope as a simplified conceptual data model segunda said to provide for a good data model is application walkthrough this is simply listing requests you need on each screen or moving from one screen to another in our sample first screen is all about displaying product overviews and sorting them with multiple criteria Saguna will show customer product details this is where they would add items to their carts and third is the cat where customer check out orders if I move from mock-up to queries you can see that we can have multiple queries for screen number one [Music] that's it we can now pose our brain this is all about applying basic rules to get to the logical data model rule number one in my application there are five queries so in my design I will have five tables rules number two for each table I locate the attribute to group results this is my partition key I stop data in the best way to return them fast for the first table category is the search criteria I defined it as the partition key and lists others attributes I do the same for every tables rules number three same as relational world the primary key ensure unicity of records but also help to sort the results close to my partition key I mark other Collins used either for sorting or ensuring unicity those are called clustering : and have ascending or descending flag I use the checkbook or notation to make it visual and I do the same for the remaining tables done we do have our logical data model last step to progress to the physical data model I will simply add type for each column it can be Scala text integers UID blog or collections set list map or even custom defined structures name unity for user-defined type and with that we have now everything we need to create the cql Cassandra query language table definitions data model is cleared what about microservice well let's start with the tables to build a micro service you will first create entities and related repositories implementing create read update and delete operations now and cuts then you shape your business or bound in context in our UCS we can use the screen some repositories can be immediately exposed as ap is other like on page require a bit of mapping indeed each time you edit a product you need to update multiple tables and boom we have our micro-service api's can be rest graph QL or G RPC based on application constraints either it needed synchronous asynchronous or even reactive operations this API can now be invoked by one or many users interface let's move to implementation to connect to the database this is a no-brainer that the sax provide a set of drivers available in multiple languages and here I will pick Java spring is a very popular framework in the Java community if not the most so here I will use some component from spring to help us spring data can help us defining objects entities and repositories spring web women we see a spring data rest or spring my flux helpers to expose REST API so rest endpoints and last but not least spring boot is a lightweight runtime to execute our micro service everywhere and especially in containers now Spring Framework is part of the pivotal companion and I have asked my yoga a developer advocate there to tell us a bit more about what the Spring Framework can bring to developer let's go ask him hey hello Mario thank you for helping me I need to create an application with spring and I heard you can help me so could you please introduce yourself and what is your current position at VMware thanks for reaching out Cedric I work at the modern applications business unit at VMware newly-acquired subsidiary of being where we used to be called pivotal but the role has not changed my role is developer advocate as to make sure and engage the spring community also the mapu community the people using our tenzou products and our kubernetes products such as BMC we have tons of um support for or spring and data stacks within the community that I'm aware of and I'll find that whatever you need to like look out for the community you can find us on github or you know Stack Overflow and spring is go to spring central there's a plethora of resources and I will help anybody including you century especially you surgery bio what would be your recommended path for me to start with spring if I were to tell you hey you wanna start a new spring application um I would just point you in the direction of spring that IO which is a great resource for finding the documentation to spring as well as a lot of trails in other words a lot of tutorials and blog posts and resources from the developer community the second thing is the spring initializer if you're a spring developer then the spring initializer is really the place to go it'll it'll get you started on an application path very quickly you don't have to mess with your Gradle or your pom file it's got it all there for you you tell it what to do what type of application you want or spring to to launch for you and it'll it'll put together the build file so it's more like a you man in any case I hope I answered your question yes that's very great so you know you speak about modules and components I can take from spring yeah I will need to work with Apache Cassandra and create a REST API so which are the tools I need for that it sounds like you have the idea of an application forming in your head right now and what I would say right now is for you to get started what you're going to need to do is understand what your data model is okay and then figure out the best database you we are going to what he used to Sandra if you have a lot of life log E or a lot of data that stands on its own that can be aggregated what are the suggestions that I would use is to check out spring data rest Cassandra which lets you actually which is a plugin for spring that will let you just use Cassandra pieces in a repository fashion that is you don't have to know too much about Cassandra right now you can write queries that are very natural and very idiomatic towards the developer that is I write an applique method and that method says find by ID and that's exactly what it does so basically I don't have to go into the driver and ask the driver to execute a sequel order to execute a cql statement and then fetch the results myself this all happens behind it behind the scenes so using the spring framework it's a very powerful tool I would advise anybody to use it sounds like can save me a lot of time yes indeed so I simply have to create an object an entity and spring data would create for me the repository and the rest resources are using spring data rest pretty cool pretty cool couple of naath card and i'm good to go yes pretty much it alright so for my app I need Apache Cassandra and seems like I also need a REST API what are the spring module I can use for those two capabilities but a lot of people tend to do is they'll go and say hey I have a a module that needs to connect to a terabyte of Cassandra data that needs to be run on spark or whatever and what they'll do is they'll they're gonna want to query the data usually they want to query the data and do light writing and I'll probably just point them in the direction of spring data Cassandra in other words start at spring do offers the modules for connecting to Cassandra out-of-the-box and the one that you would normally select miss called spring data Cassandra and that will get you the ability to test and to run it as a regular production workload but there's another way to engage Cassandra that is taking the scene by by by storm right now and it's called the reactive revolution and we also if you are interested we also support a reactive extension for accessing data if Cassandra reactively so in other words our repositories which are natural language or or close to 80 o matic language repositories like fine by IB they have their counterparts in the reactive world as well where they return reactive streams rather than standard data types so the power there is is twofold you have you have any imperative workload or a reactive workload we're ready for you either stage the Spring Framework out of the gate wet flux or web and VC blood flux is the reactive web application will web framework for driving restful applications and then the old web in VC you can still drive restful applications from there as well it's your you know you can pick and choose how you like to engage with a programming model wow there is a lot of stuff here so I can stop eating my small object which is kind of my table and then spring data would give me crud operations and spring data res spring flux and spring MVC as you said is all about exposing as an IP I like that I don't have to code it myself correct yeah there's even spring data rest which brings it even closer that is your data your data methods can also become restful endpoints which is something that's an extreme convenience case beings for messaging consoles you know really quick snap this together type of applications yeah but yes you're 100% correct it's extremely easy and there's a vibrant community out there well very nice thank you very much I think I will go and check the spring that I own right away thank you very much awesome Wow so spring is very powerful what if I called Giuliana Gua he actually created a framework on top of spring let's call him Hey hye-jin yeah I said wait how are you fine and you good good you know I do have Sophie that called me and she would like me to build a project micro service and API and I know that do you have a framework called Jeepster that could help me so I would like to do a demo and see how it works but let's start by the beginning could you please introduce yourself to everyone yes thanks Eric so I'm Judy Joo ah I work at Microsoft as a developer advocate and I'm also the author of a framework called chipster many people knows and it's a code generator for Springwood applications and it generates in particular Cassandra database tables so I think that may be useful for you yes indeed of course cassava is the database I will use for my project and you know I've also explained to people what is spraying and how spring data can you know can bring to my hat and I would like you to explain what Jeepster can bring on top of you know spring that spring boots oh yes oh that's okay you're going to be able to describe this application you you want we've got our under man language and so you will say okay we like these databases of the data table and Gypsies didn't generate for you while both the database table shows a sexual to generate the tables but also the spring boot code on top of it and if you want to go further it also generates for users or fruit under you can generate a an angular or react application and deposits no that's very nice because you know that would be a cosmetic app and I think that I need a proper and nice and bright UI so yes connecting to the database providing the tables and creating all the schema having spring data all set up ready to go the REST API also ready to go and I can interact with the web UI and interact with the web api using the documentation seems very very good is there any tool around the application I've been generating so yes so we provide many different tools as a web review that you can use to to to to to describe your app we've got some ID plugin or so if you want to well if you want to to start easy I would recommend that you start with something called stat dough chips are the tech so it's our own web app and Onstad the chips are the tech you can describe your app you will have a graphical view of it and it will even be able to generate put a request to your application if it's on github or the club so you know so it will update your application automatically nice so I don't have to install Jeepster on my laptop there is a web-based and also web tools to do it for me that seems very good so now imagine that I do have my app running is there any C to help me to deploy the app like docker support or anything like that oh yes we only spoke about the application but GIPSA is a full-stack framework and it also shows for you so infrastructure so it's going to generate for you to compose files so you can have like tests on well open with you with docker it's going to generate a lot of configuration and infrastructure file to help you throughout the lifecycle of your project it's not just generating the code it's also generates infrastructure for you very nice very nice so now I really want to test that thank you alright I have installed Jeepster 6.91 using NPL installed let's see what he can do first things to do is to create a folder and let's see what chipster can do for us alright see it's starting Oh first question which type of application would you like to create moto lytic is fine I don't need one run time per service I will get two single back in for now do you need reactive no it's simply code for now what is the name of your application Cosmetics what is your default Java package conduct Cosmetics I like that do you want to use deep style registry now I will stay everything in my app oh I can also have potent occasion ready to go HTTP session is the one I'm most familiar with database of course no-brainer let's be gas on up do you want to use any cash well customize famous to be fast for read and write I don't need any cash and I'm quite used to maven to be my project ok what other technologies would you like to use web socket no I don't need push notification now async pink-red is fine no Kafka API first no I do have my queries I will stick to my queries which framework we would like to use for the client Angela I also can pick some of my boot watch stem coming from bootstrap for so let's pick duckling and use duck international support yes first French and second English and I could add language later on when I got some success I don't need any performance tests for now would you like to install all the generators from marketplace or seems there is a marketplace where you can have some add-ons I don't know need them for now and boom it's starting let's see what it look like okay after a few minutes my application is now generated congratulation I've imported the application in Eclipse as you can see no competition aha it's been with maven and I even have some docker files to be able to run Cassandra locally because I pick a somehow database nice but the depiction is empty I should define my own entities so based on the requirements Julia created me this file using GDL studio where I do have my tables related to my queries and I will simply download this file and copy in my folder so the file is called Jeepster cosmetic GDL and I will ask Jeepster to import those entity into my project okay as you can see two containers I've been sati first is Cassandra the Gandhis migration probably to import the entities I've just created so let's see what in kasanga with a little magic of CQ LSH I can add a list of P spaces and I can see that I do have a key space named cosmetics and if I look at the tables well I do have my tables ready to entities but I also have some pre-baked tables related to users probably too under authentication and authorization it seems like I do have everything I need to start my heart so let's go to start the application I simply did MPN start for the front end and mavin for the back end so now we can see the application in running at 8080 so let's see what we have so oh wow so we do have a main page and we can switch to English this is what we ask we can also login using admin admin which is a default user so user authentication also working on the administration part I see that I do have user management metric else configuration log and ap is ready to go if I pick user management this is user admin and system created for me here is all the spring boot actuators samples and on the API part I do have a full working REST API for each entity account this is a default one for users product by category one of my table product by city and so forth and so on nice so I do have the REST API but not only that I also have a dedicated screen per entity to create items so nothing there but if I want to create a new product let's say [Music] let's say five punches 4/10 p / pics jpg name sample product price NCT and I saved my entity see I can simply add a new entity in there and I can edit back then it's a full crud UI ready to go for you so dipster has been generated full working app providing authentication administration REST API and crud UI and I didn't do anything except import entities and answering questions all right so I've just finished building my app I just click the button and it's working I will deliver that to Sofia she would be very happy about that and I will be rich very soon thank you very much it's an open-source framework how can we help you to build the framework and the community yeah so just a fully open source there is no enterprise versions it's a tool made by the community so we create in fact an association so it's a nonprofit association to manage jakester and if you want to join us well you can just come and go with us it's of course totally open and free we usually very welcoming with everybody and if you want to go the next step we also have a sponsorship system where companies can sponsor jimster and then we give that money back to our contributors in form of bug bounties again Julia thank you very much for your help and also for your framework and for everybody watching the video if you liked the demo please go to Jeepster tech and try it I said well a lot of business it could either be honest at his phone sent to say to move us as a terrace for Mademoiselle pistache demo Pompeii mo which manual application will or damara's it's messy demo Peter hospital community should be but if they use you spoken cozy Australis represents [Music] walkie-talkie pushing push back up to more ste hiker gets all the ICG [Music] also of may the stacks be with you [Music] [Music] [Applause]",
