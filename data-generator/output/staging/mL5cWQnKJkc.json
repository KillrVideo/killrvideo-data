you off with a uh a nice EDM music video about databases which you probably not seen before and then we'll be going here in just a moment let's just sit back chill we'll see you soon [Music] [Applause] [Music] and hello everybody Welcome today to our jamstack battle Stacks Workshop I Am David Jones gelardi joined by Kiren Hunter hello Kiren hello I just started at data STS last month and I just have to tell you how excited I am to share this technology with you awesome no this is not pre-recorded comps hi that's what happens when you ask a Live question and we see it um yeah it's totally live now by the way Kirsten is it can everybody hear and see us okay and for some reason Kiren I on my end my I see you Frozen let me see yeah you're Frozen in Skype and I'm not sure why but you are frozen in Skype maybe try to stop and restart your video uh sure I will do that and while we're waiting for Kirsten to go ahead and do that uh Janos um in YouTube do we need to pre-install anything no not really we we provide all of um everything that we're going to do today we can do up and we will do up on cloud instances now some of you if you choose there is a local option uh we will be working like in an IDE and such now if you do the local option then you will have some things to install but it usually doesn't take very long um but we do really encourage everybody to use all the cloud stuff we set it up so you can just do it all online and we've pre-loaded a lot for you and I heard you're back oh you're back hey kir let's try that again all right there's Kirsten wasn't just a cardboard cutout right she was actually a real person and now you can see her and hello hello hello oh where's the link for the YouTube stream afan in Discord well if at the very top in Discord of the main chat room you'll see a YouTube link that's the link to the stream itself so if you just click that that should bring you there um I can also give it to you as well if you give me just a second yes and Hoody toy yes this is all of our workshops we do record them live and then they will be available um right after the stream ends so if there's anything thank you Chris if there's anything that you need to watch after the fact or whatever if you want to review some things you can totally do that okay so first things first what I'd like to do is get in and ask all of you some questions before we get into the content so if you would um you'll see on the screen this little floating ship and you should see boom there it is you she should see a QR code and on the left hand side a URL for ment.com um so we use menty for a couple things we use it for some of the interaction in our workshops um one thing is I'm going to start by asking some of you some questions and then we're going to quiz you along the way and the top three winners of all of our quizzes today win swag right so this is important stuff um so go to ment.com the code is 9123230991 some of the things maybe we're going to address and say today uh but then also like I said you get those swag quizzes uh which are really important okay I see about 90 some odd folks in here we're just topped 100 wonderful give you another moment to do that I got frozen again oh did you get Frozen again yeah no you look like you're moving on my end okay yeah I just um I just restarted oh okay all right well you know this is always the fun with this stuff right okay so let's take a look all right we've got all right so we've got about 200 of you 218 with you with with us right now I'll go ahead and move into these questions but you can get into the menty at anytime all right so the first question which JavaScript developer are you and that includes node right oh totally yeah this could be front end back end this is really more of it's not so much the language or the frame work but are you more of a front-end JavaScript developer backend full stack I see a bunch I don't work with JavaScript and by the way um in this question I've seen come up a couple times already um if for what we're doing today if you're not familiar with any of the languages you are totally cool okay everything that we do um all the exercises the information the solutions will be provided for you so even if you're not familiar with the language um no worries you should be all right wow it looks like that we have a pretty good spread of folks um that is always fun to see all right thank you everybody for that let's go to the next question and what experience do you have with jamstack this is always a fun one I wondered I wonder how many we're going to be never heard about it right so oh I've got at least one who uses it all the time wonderful and and some folks who have used it a couple of times and most of you wow looks like most you have never heard about it before okay well good you're going to learn about it today today uh I hope by the end of this Workshop um that you will have some Newfound knowledge and be on your way to using jamack cuz Jam's actually seriously cool stuff all right so with that what I'm going to do is keep your menty open I'm just going to go to this next thing keep your menty open because as we go through the exercises as we go through um the material and we get into some of the quizzes you're going to need this later right so just go ahead and leave that up now before we get into the content it probably helps if you see the game that we're talking about by the way Kiren are you still with us I see that you're Frozen and you're you're probably doing that I am I keep I keep trying to restart it but um maybe I don't know uh I'll try again okay it's very strange fun with Skype this is a what you didn't know this this is actually a Skype troubleshooting session so anyone I have no idea what is causing it to be so unhappy it says it's on but it doesn't seem me oh maybe um I wonder if maybe you need to restart Skype actually and come back to that same L okay no problem I'll be right back all right cool all right well while Kirsten is doing that and while we're having some Skype fun there um let me explain the game and what's going on here so hopefully you all see my screens um so battle Stacks the game that we're working on today right um it's kind of similar to Something Like Apples to Apples or you know there's some card games out there that are kind of fun um where the whole goal is to kind of be say funnier or more provocative or something it's almost like Mad Libs where you asked a set of questions and you fill in the blanks right and then the other people playing get to score those questions that's what battle Stacks essentially is now this has been implemented as a is a full jamstack application right so it's react Redux using um node um and it is actually deployed this is deployed on netlify in a global CDN the whole pipeline uses GitHub cicd actions the whole kitten Kaboodle right um so this is a real app that's been deployed so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to start it real quick just to give you a feel for what that looks like so I've got a new game here here's my game code that almost looks like plee so here's plbe I'm going to do this in each one and let's join I see CHR Kiren has back hello again all right let's hope that your Skype continues to function properly yes that would be excellent okay so let's go ahead and do this there we go okay so what I'm going to do is start the game now obviously I am emulating or simulating that I am playing as three different players but in the real world uh you would have you know each each person would be would have their own uh interface that they're looking at you wouldn't see3 at the same time and then I'm going to be asked a set of questions let's see what what gets better with age wine title of the shortest book on Earth right you know I mean I don't know if these are particularly funny or not so you can totally comment and um you know tease me or whatever uh what is the next Happy Meal toy um very feet right see this is your captain speaking fasten your seat belts and prepare for 2021 that wasn't very funny I that wasn't yeah right um let's see what can I think of uh plastic cups right so then yeah right everyone everyone puts in their answers um and then what's going to happen is the players will each be asked to score them now if you answered a particular question you won't be asked to score it that's why you don't see everybody as being asked um but let's say you choose that and obviously with three people it's you know it it kind of it doesn't go to the same kind of spread if you have a group of people doing this um then um I think it's a lot better because you get a lot better scoring but then once everybody puts in their answers and they say line whatever it is then what will happen is the answers you can see it's going on the left in the lobby let's see Harry feet and it'll start taing them up or [Laughter] not let's see yeah just demoing the game I saw a question there or or we're not demoing the game because for some reason you know I love it when this kind of thing happens during um an actual event right you do it a million times uh before the event and then you get to the actual thing and then for some reason something goes funny let's try this again something did Go funny let's try a new game let's see if it ends that I'm going to Chris Chris are you watching totally blaming you Chris right let's do this pay no pay no attention pay no attention go let's try that again all HFS h fs and IH FS go go go oh I did two player threes but that's okay no one's watching right oh someone joined that's great someone grabbed the link up there and added themselves to the game that's wonderful actually that's really funny I really should make one a player one because I kind of did that by accident here we go let's go ahead and start that was funny someone so now we have four players let's see what someone does you know I'm I was curious to see if someone was going to do [Laughter] that all right let's see try this again all right and I wonder if someone got in there and voted as well we'll find out okay all right so hopefully this goes a little smoother this time but you know you get these fun uh XKCD comics in the in in the in between but as people are voting it will tell up here on the side oh even more people popped in that's too funny oh here we go oh jeez so I think you're getting the idea right uh clearly somebody else put one of those in uh I'm going to vote for the plastic virus model because that's funny and but but you get the idea right this is the game um and then after everybody votes and you go through some rounds and the the the scores are tallied up and then you see the winter there uh the winner in the lobby you know it's funny I don't know how that gets better with age but it is funny so I'm just going to go for it looks like we're going there we go okay and then in a moment yep it tallies it up looks like how hilarious whoever someone is good job because you put in funny stuff and you ended up winning it so I think you get the idea right that's the feel of the game that's what it's doing now again this has been implemented up in in jamstack right this has been implemented our jamstack stack that's what we're going to do today we're going to make this today so with that let's go ahead and get into the content now first thing first it would probably be really nice if I dropped all of you yes well done someone I agree um if I just drop you the wiki the link that we're going to work off today so all of our workshops I just dropped everyone a link um are in GitHub right so we build them in GitHub we we also build them to be self-service right um so even if you can't say do everything with us today or whatever you can always come back to this and do it later and we're always here we're always here to lend support on our Discord Channel and that kind of thing now one thing I do want to point out though is notice the link I dropped has this Wiki right if you go to the the core project if you go to the the root page um you'll be brought to an initial page here um that is actually something I'm going to show you later uh that is for when you're using the sample Gallery in Astra um that's not what we're doing today if you notice at the very very bottom if you go there it says open the workshop you want to go into the workshop go to that Wiki link that I pasted that's where you should be so you should see something that looks like this I want you at home and what we're going to do here's the format of today so for some of these sections myself and Kirsten are going to go through some of the materials we're going to start explaining some things to you and then as we get down to the bottom you're going to see these big green buttons that say next right um something like this um so the idea here is that we're going to follow these buttons linearly through the workshop through some of the things we're going to talk about and then through the exercises if you want to skip ahead that's totally up to you just you know be advised that you're going to be a little out of sync with what we're saying but that's again that's up to you all right let me see how are we doing questions just checking we did have an earlier question somebody asked uh if the if you could sort of describe better what jamstack is I'm just about to do that yes cool yeah yeah I want to at least let everybody kind of see what the game is get get menty started we're going to totally talk more about what Jam deck is yeah yes yes Argan uh the stream is going to be saved once the stream is done it will become available through the same link on YouTube okay um and Yos let's see make sure here I'll drop you a link try that link again all righty okay so first thing I want to point out um that when you go to the homepage this is where the Bas Wiki is uh you will see this table of contents here yes you can use those links if you want to jump around obviously we're going to be going linearly through the content um also at any point too you'll see this table of contents is going to follow you on the right hand side again you don't need to know where we are in all of this that's just more if you want to jump around and go to a specific section but what we are going to do is say this next move to jamstack uh and then we'll talk about jamstack and exlain that out all right so now we're in this what is jamstack now if you want to every time we get to a section I can go ahead and paste that in so you can see exactly where we are okay so somebody was just asking about jamstack can we explain a little bit more about jamstack and what that is totally right it wouldn't be very fair for us to bring you into a jamstack workshop and not at least talk about that um so jamstack is kind of a a new architecture if you will it's a new stack for the web um that takes a lot of the modern technologies that we now have available and puts them together right in in essentially a single platform or a pipeline of things that tools that you use um to be able to deploy an application from start to production being accessible on global cdns using front-end code uh with a full continuous integration continuous development pipeline um there that's a lot baked into it and that's kind of the point um these are things that individually a lot of development teams would have to come up with on their own and and build all these Integrations jamstack the idea is this is being done right out of the box right so jamstack the jam the jam stands for JavaScript API in markup um so all of this in the jamstack is going to use JavaScript now if you think about that that's kind of key because especially for front-end developers historically if you wanted to deploy something on your own well what would you need well you probably need you know backend developers you need to have integration between the front and the back end all sorts of things but what we're saying here to to days is with jamstack you can actually do the whole application from the front end you can actually do it from the front end and we we'll show you how with like servus functions and such um the API piece and and markup you're going to see as we kind of scroll down here there are some other options um so you're not like tied into a particular flavor of JavaScript you're not tied in to to a particular vendor or whatever or particular types of apis you'll see that there are options that you can choose the other thing about jamstack to understand is that it uses static pages to deliver the content as compared to rendering content at runtime right so traditionally what do you do you create some kind of website that's got capability you load that up on your server the user they go to your page and then it renders The View real time in the case of jamstack though you actually pre-render all of the pages this is part of the process and in doing so you're actually serving up static content now it's not fully static meaning that you can get d dnic you can make things Dynamic by hooking up to backend microservices those are the servess functions we're going to talk about that um but the point being why would you do this because it's faster that's essentially what it comes down to um you can use the combination of CDN with their Edge devices uh and the statically generated content to be able to serve up websites and Pages much faster than you can when you're doing it by rendering real time so looking at some of the languages right so so we've kind of marked the ones we're going to use today um so one the J and jamstack JavaScript um it can leverage multiple JavaScript framework so you can see here we're going to use reactjs today but you could use angular review um the apis again we're going to use rest today but you can use rest graphql you know there's other options there and the same thing with the markup again this application is using vanilla HTML but you could in fact use markdown if you wanted to now I mentioned the static page piece um if I don't know how many of you are familiar with that so if it's not familiar please say something essentially what we're saying here is that again we're going to pre-build when we build we're going to pre-render all the pages out those are actually being pushed out to um the various devices that in are in the CDN the content delivery Network um and that way when users go to interact with your site they're going to get those static Pages very fast so that is part of the stack is to uh have a static page generator now as I mentioned CDN if you're not familiar with a CDN this is generally what it is traditionally what would you have you'd have like a single web server or web servers right your site would be hosted on those servers and then users would connect to those servers and they would go there to get to your site but what happens let's pretend for a moment you have a server that's over here in North America say on the East Coast but you have a ton of users that are over here in Australia they're not going to get the same experience as a set of users that are there in the Americas why physics right speed of light actually speed of wire electrons can only Buzz so fast across the wire and the distance from somewhere like say Australia all the way over to here it's long enough that it really incurs a lot of latency um so by today's standards we expect everything including us we expect everything to be near instantaneous if you go to someone's application or the website and it's slow and there's a lot of lag and such you're probably going to go away right so we've come to expect that things are going to happen pretty quick so what CDN do is they take your content and they distribute it out on edge servers right you see these Edge devices that are out there and they do this automatically as part of their system you don't have to manually do this yourself this is part of what netfi is going to do and what we're going to work on today so instead of then having that single server where everything is coming out of now your content has been spread around the globe on this network so when a user in Australia down here then is interacting with your site they're actually going to a local server right there as compared to having to go all the way back right that's the CDN part is doing and then if you look at kind of again the traditional way that we used to do things or you know we've always done things for for decades now actually um you know you've got your client that's going to talk to some web server maybe some app servers in the background then that's going to be hooked up to your database and so on if you notice with jamstack it consolidates this right so you still have the client interaction but as I mentioned a minute ago instead of going to a web server where it's going to be rendered real time it's actually serving stuff up statically from the CDN any of the dynamic content that you want right um when you say are pulling data from a database or writing something there you want to change something on the screen that's actually happening in microservices through your apis uh and then that interaction with the database occurs there okay oh CDN is content delivery Network yeah and by the way I want to point something out there's gonna we're gonna kind of go high L high level we're going to kind of gloss over some of this stuff right ask your questions please do um you know because we do have a lot to get through so we're not going to go like a deep dive into every however I'm going to skip ahead a little bit and I'll come back at the end of each section there is a want to learn more piece we've tried to curate as much like useful links and knowledge as we can and put them in here so you've noticed for some of you asking questions about cdns right boom here are some links specific to that so you can really get a little deeper dive and get some of those answers okay Kon is any other questions I just I happen to see that one um yeah I I haven't seen any I'm I'm fighting with Skype again okay okay let's see all right so um we've already talked a little bit about the pre-rendering P piece what that does for you that really comes down to Performance that's what it's about you pre-render the pages they're statically generated that way when um your users hit them they don't have to wait for the realtime render it's faster is what it comes down to um jamstack also decouples your um your your front end your back end and everything like that it's decoupled as compared to being in a single monolith where you have one application that contains everything right so you'll find that in J in jamstack we're going to use more microservices and apis and modularize things so if you're wondering well what's a microservice well if you think about it maybe I have um a need to say um read and write to my database right do I need to embed that code in the whole application or is that something that I can actually have a microservice that it does that one thing and then I expose an API to my code then from the front end all I have to do is hit the API and I let it do its deal or maybe I have some calculation I want to perform or you know some little function those are really good cases for microservices to take those on now one of the benefits of those by modularizing your code and using things like microservices is then for one it's actually you know even though you may have more microservices it's it's easier to kind of digest if you will especially from a development standpoint let's say that you need to just modify a couple lines in your database interaction microservice but you don't want to have to modify the whole app or you don't want to have to have the whole app reviewed or anything you could just modify that one microservice that's kind of where you know breaking things up and making more modular really comes into play um and then as we mentioned on the CDN um the cdns especially in a case like netlify where it's a global CDN for doing really nothing you get your sites distributed globally as part of the platform that's not something that you actually have to do uh on your own hey David yeah go ahead um somebody somebody asked uh a question which is a it's a great question it's what is an a API um some people are not U not sure like what we're talking about so I have a feeling Kirsten that that's one that you want to hit yeah so go for it I I just wanna I want to start um a little bit further back than what's an API itself I want to say uh if you have a mobile phone and that mobile phone has an application on it um like Twitter or something uh there's there's an interface between your mobile application and Twitter and that interface is what we usually mean when we're talking about apis it's a it's a defined way to interact with someone else's system um you know we used to have the server client where they were very coupled tightly together but the API makes it possible for the server to present the information in a known way so that clients can use it so um what state gives you is is uh there's graphql is one kind of API it's not a a database system it is that interface um it's the it's just the different way to talk to that data and explore it um and rest and the document database we'll be using here today so the these are all just different faces on your same uh uh database and different ways for you to interact with it um so that's that's what I need excellent and Petro in YouTube does jamtech give you any help with continuous integration yes it does we're g to do that today it's actually when we first when I first got into this particular project that I had like a cool there's such a coolness factor with the things that you get just using this kind of platform um but CI and CD is totally integrated in what we're going to do okay so moving on a little bit why is this cool then right so after you know aside from all the things we've already talked about um one thing here is security you might not think that why would this enhance my security well think about what's happening here we're statically generating our pages and then pushing them out out on a CDN so pushing them out away from our original origin web server right so what this does is add a layer of uation between hackers and the amount of attack vectors they have and how you know them getting back to your server because if you think about it a hacker wants to do what they want to get to your server that's where they're trying to get to you know to you know perform their nefarious Deeds but um if you statically generate the content then that reduces an attack Vector if you push the content away from the actual server where it's originating from and they can't get to that it reduces an attack Vector right so this is actually one way it kind of naturally starts to increase your security a scalability I think we've already kind of touched on just the fact of being distributed on a CDN and what that does for you makes a huge difference in your scalability plus again since the sites of the pages are being statically generated um that by itself can actually help your performance a lot um and then that gets into the next one I'll admit when um Cedric originally put this on here when we were writing these this one threw me off too I thought something was wrong with my page and then I read it and got the joke um but but yeah this is another reason why you know here you don't have to worry about uh you know something getting stuck in render time or whatever because everything's been pre-rendered uh so performance is definitely a lot better um as far as like maintainability uh and portability um maintainability now especially and I'm not saying that full stack devs this doesn't apply or backend devs that this doesn't apply apply but especially for the front-end folks um or anybody who maintains an application today on their own with their own IT staff with their own servers and their own infrastructure right the difference here is you're able to use existing cloud-based services and tools to do all of the maintenance for you um so that is a pretty significant decrease in the amount of maintain maintaining that you need to do and the amount of work that you need to do you can actually be a loan developer create an app and use the service to push something out on a global CDN and have it managed like that's awesome really is what it comes down to um and then finally here from the portability standpoint um you know since the pages are pre-built and statically generated uh you don't have to worry about having special hosting Solutions or be locked into a vendor you can pretty much push that anywhere uh and as far as the developer experience goes that's what we're just about to do okay last part of this section so we can actually get into doing things uh is netfi a little bit more information on netfi um now we already talked about a lot of the things that netfi uh provides um part of that is going to be that Global CDN uh it's also going to provide uh apis serverless functions um there is integration what we're going to do in just a moment here you're going to start to see the the beginning of that integration between GitHub and netlify and there's an integration that's set up so when you create a new netlify site off of your GitHub repository that actually sets up the cicd pipeline and so as you start to push changes into your master branch and such that automatically kicks off your unit your functional tests and all of that right um so this is all within netlify and that is just scratching the surface of what it does but those are some of the functions we're going to use today um so for today we're going to have all of our code and GitHub um as I just mentioned our GitHub each of you is going to create your own repository that's going to get integ with your netfi by the way this is all free free services we do things on free TI workshops there should be no point where you're ask for a credit card you have to pay anything ever um we're also going to use uh an IDE called git pod so this is online we'll provide you the instructions on how to do that there are local options you may have heard me say this in the beginning um we have provided both ways we do recommend though go with the GI pod way why because we preload all of your dependencies and everything we get it set up for you so you can just go right um and then the final thing here is right here with Astra so for those of you who are familiar with Apache Cassandra we are in fact using Apache Cassandra under the hood uh that is being enabled by datax Astra that is uh our Apache Cassandra as a service in the cloud service um there's another piece here though and we'll talk more about it later called Stargate right uh this little tidbit is kind of for my existing Cassandra users you know when you interact with Cassandra you're used to having to create uh tables you know use cql queries go through drivers or whatever Stargate though offers up rest graphql and document API apis document apis on top of Cassandra and that includes OSS Cassandra what we're going to do in Astra and dayx Enterprise um the real cool thing about Astra is when you spin this up Stargate already there you don't have to do anymore okay so as I mentioned before if you want to dig deeper into any of those sections um then there are all sorts of links but before we do that we are going to get into restrictions are there before you start getting charged yeah so you know the as long as you stay in the free tier I believe in the way netfi works um you have to go past and it actually tells you what it is in the UI you have to choose to do it to give you some context though um I've been using netlify now for months and I have probably in creating this workshop and working on it killed and created hundreds of sites and I am still using the free tier I've had no limit a on anything that I can do now am I you know pushing through thousands of operations a second and doing things like that no um so I would invite you and we do have some NFI documentation here to take a look at their um their documentation on what are the levels there but I do believe you actually have to you have to choose that I've never actually been prompted put in a credit card or anything it's as I understand it is the free tier is free uh until you decide that you want to go to the PID tiers okay okay all right so let's move on so what we're going to do is we're going to lab one set up and deploy and here's what I want you to notice at the top here you're going to see this exercise time so we're going to take approximately 15 minutes for this um so the format is going to be this we're going to give you the 15 minutes to do the exercise and we're going to be quiet but at the tail 5 minutes we're going to verbally we're going to start looking at some Q&A we're going to start answering some stuff in the chats we're going to let you do do the work last 5 minutes um we will um start verbally answering some things and then we're going to move into our first quiz so here let me go ahead and drop this link for everybody here you go so again if you're following along oh and if you're asking how to create the GitHub repository you're going to do that here in a moment right I saw that question pop up um so everything that you're going to need is in the instructions that we're going to go through all right with that everybody go ahead and get your 15 minutes like I said we'll be quiet mostly and then we'll answer some questions here at the end I will actually go through this with you but I'll do it silently just so you can use that for reference for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] by the way I did forget one thing that I need to tell everybody notice uh on your menty that you'll see this lab one set up and deploy when you're done with your lab give us a thumbs up here so we know you're done ah that h for okay hey [Music] all right we're coming down to our last five minutes I do see a lot of people gave thumbs up so far so that's great I am seeing some questions here I think I've seen a couple folks um saying that they gave battle Stacks as a repository name it says it's not found uh chiton over in Discord let me take a look at the link you dropped here let's see what's going on right so if you're so you're going to want to go uh to the root of data sex examples battle Stacks right and when I do that I have used this template um that should be enough now obviously I've already created mine um but if I click that then that'll bring me to this dialogue but at that point it should be copying datle Stacks examples battle Stacks is that what you're seeing and then yeah and then you can just put in battle stacks for the repository that's right that's the name that it's going to that's right now I've already cre coming from yes yes so here yeah you do now mine's complaining because I already did it right um but yes you would put battle Stacks in here don't forget to include all branches that is in the instruction um uh make sure that you get that that's that part is important but let's see if that gets you further and I'll leave that up here for a second any other questions or things that we should address Kiron that you're seeing mostly I'm just wondering why it is that Skype always freezes me with a really grumpy look those are the best times right you're just like yeah so um you know thanks for all the the feedback that that you've given guys uh we're definitely make sure that the instructions are very explicit that you need to have a GitHub account and be logged into it I think we mention it but um maybe we maybe we need to mention a little bit more I'm noticing a lot of the same points so it it seems like that's kind of tripping some folks up um but yes and we definitely don't want you guys to get to get blocked by Something That We're assuming yeah so to that point right um yes you do need to have a GitHub account I'm sorry I did not mention that right off the bat um because you're going to copy you're going to create use that template to copy our repo into your own repo because you're going to deploy that to your own production CDN right so you do need an account for GitHub so if not you'll have to go um and create an account there now one thing to note is I'm am I'm actually using the brave browser throughout this whole thing but brave giving it given its nature and what it does it suppresses a lot right um so depending on the browser you're using you might want to watch to see if you get any popup lockers or things like that you may need to allow some access in some browsers because I'm seeing a couple questions come through along like hey I I didn't get this dialogue or whatever and a lot of the times that's security settings in your browser let's see okay um uh Bel in YouTube we need to select web app and netlify so in netlify me go back um what it's actually going to do and if we go to the instruction here you should see this right when you create your account you should see this new site from git um so once you have you click that button you associate it with the GitHub repository that you just created um what you saw me doing you don't have to do um this was the initial deploy that happened I don't know if this is what you're asking about um I just clicked on that so I can kind of see the log and see what was going on as it did the initial deploy but all you should have to do at this point is do new site from get follow the prompts uh to associate it with your battle Stacks repo the one that you created and that's it it'll go ahead and Deploy on its own the game oh vinet good question the game is not already done what we have done is we provided the most of the um the stubs we provided you stubs that you're going to fill in right so there's a lot of the game that's actually completed off but there are some parts that we're going to focus on today there are not okay how are we doing on time we've got about a minute and a half left here okay cool wonderful and if you are done please give us the thumbs up over here so we have an idea of how many of you are getting through great yes Chandra and YouTube totally um select you should have an option for a European region as well select the one closest to you um the the free tier has two regions it's it's either East or Mia I would select a Mia probably in your case let's see now I will say if you for some of you I see who are have probably already launched it you noticed that um uh you can you can try using the app it's not going to do anything yet because we have not the the insert game function is only stubbed out it doesn't actually have any guts yet we're going to do that here in a minute um so if you try to do the game it may not do anything just yet but we will get there all right so we are down to our last 5 Seconds wonderful all right let's go ahead and turn that timer off but here we're going to go we're going to move into our first game so you are going to want to get yourself ready for this all right everyone get to menty time for a game time for a quiz I should say it's going to be the first question in the quiz I will let folks get a moment to get back into the menty um if you weren't in yet you want to get in again go to your QR code or go to minty.com 9123230991 Jam apples [Music] molests something about this kind of music that makes you want to do your hands like this right that's right the correct answer was in fact JavaScript API markup that is what the jam stands for so let's take a look at our leaderboard so you'll find in the quiz that speed does matter but so also does correctness and let's see what happens here all right so eight and one was the fastest with the correct answer so is currently in first place Beethoven in second place and Ariel in third all right let's go ahead and move then to our second lab so excellent thank you everyone for playing that is just the first question so we're going to want to stay in there uh and we'll do more of that oh you like that do you like the music Jordan that was fun you know an on if it doesn't ask for your name and you just move on it will me will automatically assign you one okay so we're going to now move in to lab 2 creat your Astra instance so I'm going to go ahead and click on that this one is going to be 10 minutes um and I see you know something I will give you I'm so sorry Muhammad I see that next time I'll give you a little bit more time for the menty that's what I was trying to um allude to in the beginning uh when I mentioned that keep your menty open and you know we we had the survey questions hoping everyone was in there we have a lot of us on today I'll give you more time but guess what it doesn't mean you're out of the game right there's seven questions and trust me with menty it's anyone's game for that all right let's go ahead and get our 10-minute timer going there it is again we are doing lab two here you go this is lab two I appreciate your understanding there yeah yeah sorry I'll I'll wait more but now you know now you know what to expect right you know going to jump right into the mty and go but yeah I'll wait more for the next one for everybody it's the top three that can win swag for the menty okay all right so for this one we have 10 minutes go ahead and follow the instructions to create your asra incense and just like before I'm going to go ahead and do this with you and one other thing I'll mention real quick and then I'll be quiet for the 10 minutes um the the estimates in here do include read time we're not expecting you to just go lightning through and and try to just do all the commands and everything you see um we are trying to give you some time so you can actually read what's on the page and kind of grock what's there I just wanted to point that out for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay great it looks like a lot of you have your asterra incense already created it does go pretty quick and we are coming up to our 5 minute mark for [Music] [Music] okay so we're at the five minute Mark so what I'll do is I see some of you asking questions about Cassandra and I expect that actually um we haven't really talked much about what Cassandra is we will in a section that's coming up but why not we can totally talk about it now um Cassandra is a distributed nosql database right right um it's been around for a little bit more than 10 years now used by a vast majority of the Fortune 100 companies there is there's almost no if you go on your phone right now and you pick an app or something I guarantee you're using it somewhere and what Cassandra is really known for other than just being distributed is that the way that it it scales and and how it handles that so Cassandra is known for being able to maintain performance at scale that's whether you have three nodes or thousands of nodes and by performance we're talking on the orders for rights in micro or milliseconds and in the course case of reads in the order of milliseconds um and it in particular it scales horizontally uh as compared to vertically so if I'm vertically scaling something um I'm going to add more CPU I'm going to add more memory I'm going to add faster and bigger drives and that kind of deal I'm going to scale up and up and up and up but you can only go so far that way where Cassandra scales out right so you add on more nodes if you want to scale it up and you can do this while you're running real time uh without having any downtime so it's known for its robustness it's known for its performance its scale um Uber Spotify PlayStation which I always thought was fun net u Netflix um anytime you're in a in a Netflix right uh every time you're pausing playing you're interacting uh recommendations whatever that's all coming from Cassandra um most of uh you know your credit cards Banks uh FedEx Home Depot Target Lowe's I there are so so many big players of things that we use every day that are using Cassandra right so Astra is that it's Cassandra in the cloud it's a managed Cassandra database so what you're seeing here is when we created this we just created our own Cassandra cluster right here but it's being managed for you so the trick with Cassandra um a lot of people you know if you look at running it it's been kind of considered like a porser Lamborghini where yes it's amazing at what it does but it can be really finicky right if you don't know how to run it properly so what what we've done for you with Astra is we've essentially taken that management need out of the equation you just come over here and you start it up and go um what's really cool about this here is that especially from a development standpoint especially using the free tier you can spin one of these up get going hook up your plumbing make your app work do all that and if you decide you want to go to open source and and run your own Cassandra you can totally do that with the same driver same code and everything um so it is a really awesome resource from a development standpoint to stand up the database that's essentially used for all the big players okay all right let's take a look and our time we're down we got 2 minutes left all right and let me take a look at how are we doing on 124 good complete excellent all right so I think we're pretty good I mean oh yeah vness I see the cap theorem yes cap theem is wonderful there um yeah um I am I am SRC in Discord how is Cassandra different than um the one biggest thing that I'll just point out is uh where at some point well Wango one is a document DB Cassandra is not it's actually by Nature um it's going to be more of what you consider like how you'd see relational with the tabular format funny enough with Stargate which we're going to talk about here soon it does in fact support a document DB that's what we're using today the big difference though is as you start to pull away in scalability mango starts to hit some limits uh where Cassandra doesn't right Cassandra is essentially indefinitely scalable um and there's definite differences on um the way that Cassandra handles robustness there is no master node in Cassandra it's a peer-to-peer system all nodes can do what any other nodes do this means from resiliency you can actually have in some cases 2/3 of your cluster down and still be up and still be available and still be able to facilitate uh operations and and writes and reads and everything so um there there are definitely some differentiators between the two but we don't really focus on that here much we're not trying to you know get in and poooo on Mango or anybody um but yeah I would say when it comes to resiliency and scalability that's the the big difference there all right let's see all right so we've got about 30 seconds left and do we have some more folks coming in 135 great Kirsten there anything that we should talk about any questions we need to hit I think it seems like everybody's getting through really well I think so I think so okay all right I'm gonna uh uh I'm G to detach my external Monitor and see if it fixes okay cool all right all right well I am going to stop the timer for now let's go ahead and move in you know uh Reuben some of us I guess it depends on who you're asking who are Americans uh there are some we have a global team uh so Kirsten and I yes but others on the team are actually from uh France and Russia um England yeah we've got folks around alrighty let's go ahead and move in to the next section over here so what I'm going to do is move into this netfi section so again if you're following along here I'm going to go next move to netfi and I'll drop the link for everybody yeah okay okay so for this section really I'm just going to go a little bit deeper into netlify we just kind of introduced it in the beginning um but it would probably help to know a little bit more about it um now one of the things to point out and you're already starting to see some of this integration when you created your netlify site from your git repository some things automatically happened for you right um so if I take a look at the site settings we're just going to I'm just want you to see something right so in netlify by default fault what it's going to do is it's going to say hey I'm going to go off of your master Branch as your production branch and I'm going to trigger off of any commits to that Branch right so anytime anything changes in master it's going to kick off an automatic deploy in nfy now there's a distinction between things that are you're just testing something out like a poll request compared to I want to actually push this production I am merging it back into Master right and nlii makes those distinctions um well what's cool here is that you're not limited to just these settings if you want to include other branches or something you can totally do that but for our purposes today we're going to stick to master it's the same thing with building right um you'll see here that um the build command is configured to be npm run build anyone working with the JavaScript Frameworks and and such is probably familiar with this uh again you can configure that differently but that's really the the kind of the point here is that netfi has flexibility there um and you can configure it to do all sorts of things and build time and how you want it to deploy but for now we're going to use um those uh those default features netlify also gives you the ability to you know you can turn on monitoring you can see that um somebody already mentioned it earlier um you can actually set up a custom domain right and now for what we're doing today we don't require that you don't need to do it uh it'll just generate one for you um but you can in fact set up a custom domain and you can secure everything with https and that's part of the service right so that's nothing you have to do explicitly in your own code or anything like that um they've got some other capabilities um with like their forms where you can get like automatic notifications about new form submissions which is really cool what I found really neat in working with NFI so far um are both the command line interface and the apis there um they clearly expect folks to be doing things from an IT perspective programmatically behind the scenes not just through the UI and both the CLI and the API are pretty they're pretty expressive right you can do a lot and if you notice by the way notice there's a link in each one of these right so if you want to dig in and get more on the docs then I would encourage you to do that okay so moving on real quick now the part that I really want to focus on today though is the netlify functions I've seen some questions on this already um this is the core this is how we're going to add in the dynamicism into our app because again remember we've created static pages right we're going to generate those static Pages well how do I then change the things on my page how do I you know how do I do that that's where the netlify functions come in these are your seress functions right and here's what I really want to point out notice here this knock this call out to the netlify Tomo so if we take a look at our repository that we created we scroll down you see this netlify Tomo here this is the configuration that netfi is going to use to tell it things like oh what am I using to build oh where is my functions directory my serverless functions directory we're telling it it's functions so in my app and we're going to do this here in a moment you're going to see there's a functions directory if I drop functions in that directory and then if I export and Export a Handler in a function like this that's all you need to do from that point on netlify will see this as a serverless function and it will deploy it as such so even though these are just stubbed out they're not not doing anything just yet here's what I want you to see if I go to functions here in netlify notice what's notice what we have oh well I'm being for some reason Skype just dropped and um it's asking me interesting things uh give me just a second I don't know what's going on with [Laughter] this okay let me turn that off give me just bear with me just a moment here oh I see what's going on okay here I will set this give me a second it looks like kisten was having issues with her computer so let me go ahead and set it up so she can just drop right back in and then I will go back to what we were talking about there we go okay all right so so as I was mentioning a moment ago right so because we have these two stubbed out here right hello world and insert game um then and we've also and you'll see in the stubs when we go to build them they are both exporting a Handler uh and they're dropped in the functions directory that's it that's enough to tell netfi go ahead and build these as servos functions now from the want to learn more thing you'll see there's less links here both of these are good however this tutorial right here I really encourage you to check it out if you want to get a lot deeper into um the netlify functions and how they work and all that go check that out that it's it's a really nice resource all right so with that we are going to move into our lab three but you know something Kirsten are you back no okay not yet all right so what we're going to do actually right before we do that is we have another quiz to take so let's do this time I will wait for you a little bit longer I promise I will wait I may have just lied all right so what is Astra it's an in a local in-memory version of Cassandra it is Cassandra as a service in the cloud it's a development tool it's a gateway to the Stars [Music] all right the correct answer was it is Cassandra as a service in the cloud absolutely correct and let's take a look at our leaderboard how are we doing this [Music] time the timings the the speed timings are always the fun part oh see how it changes all right so we have uh H lus hlus how am I saying that one and number one sorry Ariel number two and Aiden number one you're still holding in the top three uh like I said this can be anybody's game as we move forward all righty now we're going to get into some of the fun here in lab three so we're going to move to lab three hello world now you're going to deploy your first servis function right so we're going to give you about 20 minutes again for this follow the instructions um now one thing I do want to point out before you get started you'll see there's two options git pod or local this is the one that we suggest that you do use git pod because everything is pre-built for you you can just get in and start doing things in code um Local's not that bad honestly but you do have some dependencies and stuff that you need to account for um so we do suggest that you do it in the git pod way just so you can be on the same page with everybody all right let me go ahead and get our timer going there we go you know I'll answer your question real quick Ruben in voice uh it's you know it's not I'm not trying to say that giot is better than like VSS code or or eclipse or whatever like that um from what we're doing in these workshops we're able to pre-bake the IDE and the configuration and the the dependencies for you in G pod um so it's really nice plus this way you don't have to download anything you're doing it all up in the cloud that's why that's why we use them for these workshops giod is actually a great resource if you're working with GitHub you can just launch giod right out of your code and and work against it yeah yeah I'm with you Ruben yeah yep and again once you finish give us a thumbs up let us know you're done and hey ksten I see you back wo I am back it's very exciting I looked at all the troubleshooting sides and the one thing I hadn't done was restart my computer so here we are well hopefully that does it all right and I have to do this along with everybody oh man you need to have now playing widget so people know what the means um this is let me get you uh let me get you that one if I can h that e [Music] for [Music] [Music] yeah just a not notice about Gip pod um I do Wonder we have a lot of you on today um I do wonder if the G pod folks are going to call us up after this today um so if if if GT is taking a moment that's all right um usually it's pretty quick usually it just takes a a minute or so um but even I can tell that it feels like it's um with maybe with all of us on we're stressing them a little bit so I would say give it give it another moment and you're really frustrated we do have uh the local instructions but we're not going to cover them um ourselves and uh it's up to you but if you're an mpm person already and you want to give it a shot um those those instructions are available for you to uh work through yeah I am noticing I am seeing some folks that are having uh it's taking a moment with G pod you know you could yeah we are the DJ TOS got has it right we're literally ddosing gpod we kind of the there there might be some truth in that so um I would ask either be patience uh patient now we could even make it worse I was going to suggest for some of you um you could uh spin up another uh you know another Tab and try it there and see if you have any more luck not that it's going to make the problem any better um you know maybe uh for future workshops uh we could try to provide a Docker container for those of you who are comfortable in Docker yeah that you know has the right setup for you um it but again it would be a different experience than what we're talking about but if you're comfy with Docker and you want to dive in there um hopefully we can have that available um for future workshops in case this happens by the way I just need to give a shout out in YouTube to uh M4 ii4 she understands what I just meant there that's [Laughter] Maria all right I'm seeing I'm seeing some positive vibes on the docker idea yes Ruben this is based on a uh a react app but I'm answering questions verbally too soon sorry about [Music] that all right so uh so we will definitely plan on uh having a Docker path uh for our future workshops um to let you guys um take a different um path [Music] for [Music] [Music] no [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so Maria is saying she finally got our nodes have faith in gift pod so um maybe it seem like we're kind of giving them a lot of load because we have so many folks on um I think we'll just have to be patient with it is what I'm what I got from that yeah okay it looks like some are starting to show up oh I think you've hit the nail in the head with that hon okay so we're down to our last uh four minutes or so I do see it seems like for um for some folks get pood is catching up I I think we just kind of slammed it there so uh no for the future uh maybe maybe we need to reach out to the team too and let them know maybe they can uh spin up some extra instances or something when we do this kind of stuff um and I did see um I did see a couple conversations with folks and using a fork now you may have missed it in the instruction um but we explicitly set it up to use templates right and here's why here's why if you use a fork then anytime you try to merge back or you try to go you you try to you know create a PR it's going to want to go back to the parents so what's going to happen is this it's going to go all the way up okay so you see the parent here um oh ignore that sorry I'm over here my bad there we go see it's generated from data sex examples Fork however if you used a fork instead of a template which is what this uh that we use the template here then you're going to see this forked from what that translates into though is every time you try to do a PR it's going to try to default back to going back to our repository for your changes not your repository if you use a template you you don't have to worry about that and every time you do a PR it'll go correctly to your master and it will and by the way if you used a fork every single time I I looked I looked so hard to see if there's a way in GitHub to default it after using a fork and I couldn't find anything right so um it is one of those things where you we really really really suggest use the template as we have in the instructions otherwise it's going to get a little more challenging especially when you're trying to commit your changes and merge back um now this one too this one's got a lot lot of steps in here um and even though I went through it um I do recognize that there's there's a lot going on I just want to kind of break it down for you just a little bit here um so we'll go past the git pod stuff um you may have noticed that I asked you all to do a get remote- V why because I wanted you to validate that you were in the correct Branch right or you're in the correct repo I should say sorry so notice I'm in Sonic DMG I'm not at dated sex examples that's where I want to be I know I am trying to commit back to my repo not the parent repo um setting the origin just makes stuff a little bit easier as you go to commit back and we want to use my Branch we want to check out dasb which is going to create a new local branch my Branch for your changes now once we've done that though here's what I really want to point out we go to our hello world it was stubbed out we create the new hello world right then when we run notice what happened um when we did this next command where it go here this GP preview what is this doing this is a g pod function um so GP preview is saying hey load this into the preview window this now since G pod is a cloud-based IDE you have cloud-based URLs all this is doing here is generating that URL at Port 8888 and then it's tagging on netlify functions hello world so this is our serverless function that's what this did here this is our serverless function this the one that we exported a Handler we put it into our function directly directory like we talked about that was configured now this is accessible through its serverless function but what's really neat is when you go and I saw somebody make this comment right this is awesome I think this is what so cool once you get the set up uh about netlify is once we go to our functions right now I've got my function I go to the link that it generated notice this right here that is the same that's the same endpoint that we use whether we're local whether we're we up in the cloud weather we're in our production deployment so then later on when I use this is my my netlify endpoint but notice I just had to use the same exact axis herey functions SL hello world boom there is my Hello World function spitting out the output um and then the rest of this here now this is this part what we're doing is we're taking the changes right because we changed our we changed our hello world code here so now we're merging this back we're going to push our my Branch that's why it's important that you use that push that back up um the whole flow that we have to go through here with the poll request if you're not familiar with doing this right if you're not familiar with poll requests this is a wonderful feature in GitHub and you should really use them I mean this is like a very strong suggestion as compared to say just merging right in a master or something you use a polar request to say hey I want to propose this code then you can assign reviewers you you have a moment like think about what you just did and then you can choose to merge it what's awesome about what happens here because we're integrated with netfi is if we take a look at this PR this was I mean this is so cool um so this is my PR from the change right but what happened was an automatic set of unit tests and all sorts of tests were kicked off I'm trying to find my um here it is it ran it actually l in GitHub actions right this is GitHub actions doing this it actually went through installed mpm installed note did all that stuff ran the tests ran the function test did the whole thing right here in GitHub actions this is the cicd pipeline in action that's exactly what's this doing not only that but with the integration here with netlify what did it do notice these deploy previews that's what happens when you create a PR every time you create a PR back to master it's going to create a deploy preview the point being it's going through the whole process it's doing all the checks ensuring that everything is good before you push the production so when we came here and it went through all those tests I saw somebody mentioning you know the tests and we got that green light and we said merge that's what that's what that was about it actually went through the whole Pipeline and then we could confirm the merge once we confirm the merge then it went and deploy to production so I just want you to kind of think about the ramifications of what just happened there yes so there's a lot of steps we went through it this one this one time in the beginning so you could kind of do that but once you get into this flow once you hook it up you make your changes you create you know you push them back you make a PR it kicks off the whole pipeline the whole cicd pipeline once that is good to go you know you're good to push production you confirm your merge now it pushes it out and it just did this automatically this is now available on netlify global CDN I didn't have to do anymore so I just yeah I just want to leave that with you I had to take uh take a moment to talk about that um all right so what do we have questions up um I am muted am I muted no you're not muted I can hear you okay so uh I also to just uh to pile on with what you were just saying about branching yes one of the things people say is well I'm the only one using my repository so why do I need to have branches I just want to put everything on M but what if you want to add two different features or a feature and a bug fix and um you just if you pull the branches you can sync them with Master you can push them back individually and get will help you out saying oh somebody actually already changed that line uh in a previous push Master yeah what do you want to do about it but being able to you keep that a little bit more modular is very useful even when it's just you yeah and uh z00 chill or ill or however you say that um where do you run the commands I saw this question come up a couple times so when you're in G pod right um You were automatically generated a terminal um but if you want to create another terminal you can just say new terminal and you just run them in the terminal right um the same thing with uh if you're doing it locally then you know whatever whatever terminal of your choice that you run that's where you're going to run those wherever your application is um and generally you want to be running them in the battle Stacks directory I try to put this in the docs to make sure it was pointed out Ure you're here um that's where you're going to run the commands from uh the other thing is a a a few people were having issues getting get pod going yes and uh so the other so um apparently we have a big button says running get pod that doesn't work um and also people are having trouble like creating the URL for git pod but you can go back to the base of your um your repository and click on the git pod button that'll work too so oh yeah if you've got the that's right if you have the um um the extension that the Chrome or the Firefox extension installed you'll see to what Kirsten is referring to actually I'm using Safari so and you have the green giop button I do that's interesting yeah um I mean maybe they added it I'm not sure yeah maybe they did yeah usually for this you need to have the extension installed yeah so um you know but thanks for the feedback that it was us how to uh create your url um we'll we'll try to make that uh an easier uh task for you yeah agreed totally agreed totally agreed okay oops I just lost my place I'm over here here we go all right all right let me take a look how are we doing on questions and everything now one thing uh you know if if if for some reason um if you have an error in code or something like that and a function's not working properly we do offer the full game that has all the stuff um also uh there are solutions are actually code Solutions in each of the pieces um that you can use uh to see that the full working code I do see a couple of them here as I'm looking um um Lambda response was undefined check your function code again so I would say in a case like that I'm making a basis assumption uh tier um and I saw somebody else that I have the same Tony T over on YouTube are you seeing that in netlify or are you seeing that locally that feels like you're seeing it netlify if you are what you can do is you can actually notice what I'm doing right in netlify I'm going to functions and I can go to the deployment for my function and I can take a look at it um if there are any logs for it or whatever you'll you'll see those come up um you know if there's an issue you might be able to see it come up but we'll see if we can't hope you guys figure those out yeah I'm seeing actually I'm seeing a couple folks with the lomda response was undefined check your function code again interesting well you know what I'm gonna do here let's cheat here's the code just I don't know how well this is going to paste into YouTube honestly uh that might not be the best way to do it and I will paste it over here in um Discord as well it should be that yeah it looks like uh one of the people who's getting that Lambda problem has exactly the same content interesting well that's so um might be a netlify thing I'm not sure I don't know that's that's an interesting one that is an interesting one okay maybe um oh yes Petro's got it we totally a save don't forget to save I have a feeling what's happening because the auto saave is on by default save your code try again if unless you already did that I'm so excited I hope that's it but um yes I have totally done that to myself save your code that might very well be it yes that's that's I'm I'm laughing internally if you can't tell that's really a good one and and and we will and and thank you guys for for finding that will definitely add to the instructions like a reminder hey don't forget to save um because you know all right good all right so with that let's give I'll give everybody just another minute I know that um I also um uh Ariel I also compulsively save I am a a control Esser or on the Mac of Commander like OCD I'm with you on that one that is yeah yay I'm seeing more people getting hello world working now oh that's great no shame people that's great no no there's no shame at all there's not at all that was my fault we should have said something um so I'm just going to warn everybody the next Quiz is coming up I want to warn you quiz is coming up all right prv I do see that we're going to move on for now we'll try to we'll try to get it as we go into the next section okay someone's got it uh uh rashed could you uh post um with the with the content of that um the content of your function yeah that feels that feels like something is off in that code with Rasheed there yeah that okay all right so let's move on uh CU we do need to keep going so let's go ahead and move on to our are you all ready for it you know what's going to happen now quiz [Music] all right I'll give everybody a moment to get in here this time I promise I'm [Music] waiting can't help but like bounce to this music is it just me or what oh thank you Ryan Yes here let me put the code up you're right you're right you're right code is m.com 91 2328 yeah [Music] yes yes Maria it's totally do do doot all right let's see all right I see more folks coming in all right we'll give it just another moment here and let's do it how do you tell net lefi where to look for serous functions in your code netlify.com [Music] V nf. Tomo netlify fingers and [Music] toes I think we actually have it configured in the netfli netlify do TL yeah the toml yep it's the netlify dotl um and again if you take a look at your base repository where you copy the code you look you'll see a netlify tummel there and that's where the configuration is all right let's see what happened in our [Music] leaderboard oh hi Ariel I see Ariel's up there and all right so H lissus is still at top 8 and one holding up in second place at aiel number three and B nice job being the fastest and you're really close this is still a close game by the way we're going to have another question so going into the next question all right and let's see what this one looks like deployment to production when pushing to master is automatic manual you should really create a polar request first no really create a polar [Music] request this one might be kind of mean honestly but we'll find out in a moment I think I will see I may have been slightly mean in this I'm sorry because I can only imagine that some people thought that the answer was you should really create a polar request but regardless if you do or you don't the push the deployment to production when pushing Master is still automatic right when you when when the code gets to master it is in fact automatic um so I am so sorry for those of you who were like oh he's being funny I'm going to go for that one and then you thought you know but you are correct though you should really create a polar request first let's see what happened in our leader board I wonder if this is going to completely change the board we just oh Ariel got the fastest and takes top takes the lead Vivic and number two in h licius in third all right all right so good job everybody all right so we're going to talk just a little bit about um Stargate AST right we haven't really talked about it yet at this point um so I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next section here and I will drop everybody the link and we're only going to take a minute to talk about this okay so the next section what are Astra and Stargate so we did talk a little bit about Astra already right um the one thing I didn't mention earlier was that Astra isn't just Cassandra a manage Cassandra in the cloud but it's Astra and Dev tools right it's got a whole set of Dev tools that actually come with it now part of this you see this little Stargate icon that's what that is um Astra already provides the Stargate integration this means you can have Cassandra with rest graphql and a document API um there's a nice cql console that you're going to use here very soon actually you may have already done it um there's a bulk loader there's a data loader um you know so if you want to get in data uh you know that is out outside of it there are methods that you can use to actually bulkload that data in there's all sorts of Ops tools that are there as well matter of fact this devops API is really kind of cool we've opened that up um so you can talk to Astra programmatically you're not just limited to the UI there are metrics in there the service broker for those of you using kubernetes and if you want a way to be able to easily connect to Astra through kubernetes boom that's a service broker right so all this stuff is being provided to you with the managed um with the manag Cassandra platform I should also mention even though in the free tier you're limited to Google Cloud for now just because it's it's free and it's it's cheaper for us to run that's all it comes down to um the other Cloud providers AWS and Azure are in fact available as you go up into the other tiers um so there's there's a lot there that is separate from just a manag Cassandra um from the Stargate standpoint and I know Kirsten you're going to probably have more to say here we've been talking about this a little bit really what this comes down to um is this is now adding on these other apis again for those of you who are familiar with Cassandra um you would not expect that you can just talk to Cassandra through rest through graphql or through a document uh API but that is now available with Stargate Stargate is its own open-source project right um so it's Stargate IO you'll see that here in the documentation um and yes we started at data sex but we open sourced it right off the bat because we want this to be part of the community what's really cool is if you have an open source Cassandra deployment today you can go ahead and you can actually put Stargate right you can add it right now to your cluster even in open source um and and start getting this functionality you know right away um so this kind of gives you an idea of this diagram again you can see here the various apis Because cql by the way it's still there that didn't go away um but then it supports Cassandra 3 the upcoming four which is going to be released pretty soon and then from datax Enterprise 6.8 and on and of course we provided you with a set of resources the Stargate docum M ation like is giving a four or four no which one is doing that that's really uh looks like it's probably the first link under the um under the logo this one under the logo the logo under the logo oh this one oh no at the top oh no oh a page changed oh my bad all right sorry about that um yeah so I would say if you I need to fix that no no taken um down here and just go to Stargate .io and then I'll get you what you need yeah okay so let's see go I just want to highlight one of the things you said yeah um so uh there was a a a slightly snarky comment um from one of the attendees that said that we're using Cassandra because it's what we sell um but I want to point out that everything that you're doing here you can do yourself you can uh install Cassandra Cassandra as open source you can use kubernetes to control uh the nodes you can you can put star over over the top you have don't have to have anything to do with us that's right um so um these are projects that we're really proud of um and we're especially proud that we have them in the open source Community yeah and just to add to that you know I I totally get the sentiment um you know but outside of of Astra if you know if you look at what data Stacks does we've we you know the the beginning of uh Cassandra um you know it came out of Facebook but those people came and created data stacks and data stack has been the company behind Cassandra for the last 11 years or something right so we first and foremost are here for Cassandra adoption regardless of Astra regardless of those other things and and as Kiren said um all of that stuff um you know pretty much everything we've talked about the kubernetes stuff the Stargate stuff it's all open sourced right so our our goal is for Cassandra adoption and and for what's going on there not so much trying to sell creds if you will all right so with that we're gonna to our next section here and I forgot that I didn't have sound on there for a second oops not that one I meant the nice calming music here we go all right let's so we're going to go to lab four now this is where we're going to start to set some of the we're going to hook things up is really what we're after here let me go ahead and drop these links for you okay here you go and here you go there we go so now the next what we're really going to do is for the next three sections so you're going to see lab four five and six that's what we're after we're after a lab four five and six just do them all in one shot right we're going to do them all in one shot um so and you'll find that they're they're actually pretty short uh so here the key thing about these sections and what to understand is what's going on here is okay we've created our git repository we've hooked it up to nlii we've done a deployment but we haven't hooked up any of the plumbing yet we haven't hooked up our database you know we created the database right but we haven't hooked that up to our code we haven't hooked that up to our cicd pipeline we haven't hooked that up to NFI these next three sections so you're going to go from set Environ variables in your application set this to set secrets in GitHub to set environment variables and netlify you'll be done when you're done with this section set environment variables and netlify now we're going to hook up all the plumbing between these Integrations and make it so we can start talking to our database wherever we deploy our app all right with that I will give you 20 minutes so let's go ahead and get that going go Boop I mean there it is and again I will do it with [Music] you that's not there [Music] [Music] [Music] um is that true what's that uh I changed my DB password and I think once your uh database was created you could change it after the fact there under settings there I could just be wrong maybe that was an old way and I'm update I'll take a look at it in a second oops [Music] what did I [Music] miss oh I think I think I missed a step yes the nbsh should be in your repository yeah right that's strange uh Igor in Discord does not have the env. which is extremely strange did he maybe pull it from uh Academy and not examples that could be a Thing If You Did In if you somehow got your repo from data Stacks Academy bet battle stacks and not data Stacks examples that could be what's going on there um here's what you can do eore of course if that's the case your code's not going to be up to date at all but you could go and use this yeah that's I'll admit I'm really thrown by that one h [Music] I can I I'll just paste you the code that way you can move forward yeah that's a really interesting one eigor um you can also do um this from from uh yeah in case for some reason it's not or uh maybe we don't have the permissions set correctly or yeah I'm not sure I'm just that that works too yep ah you have a different name oh okay [Laughter] pH okay I was like that that would have me going there [Music] um yeah okay um I guess we didn't get in the part to delete the astop ASC that we did sounds like uh um Fox is having some trouble with it so yeah cuz I add I'll I'll look but I'm pretty sure that got in it maybe maybe I thought it didn't I'm wrong here let me give me a second let's take a look yep it's there oh oh oh did I not PR it back in oh well this is what happens when uh so apparently I missed I missed a change I missed a change that is my fault well hopefully not many people are running into that could you run the um are you have you run the First Command oh no that's I well we'll we'll get to it in a sec [Music] [Music] e [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] e e for okay one thing I think I should point out because I am seeing some questions on it um if you're at the end of lab 4 and you're filling out your EnV file right so there's that script um that should be in place that env. shell and if you run that it's going to prompt you to paste in the data that you get from the connect tab so in the instruction if you follow that you'll come here it'll grab this these are your database credentials right then you run that script and it says please paste the export block you paste that in hit enter and says enter your database password so I'm going to battle password one now take a look at my EnV file at this point once I have thatv file that's it right I'm done with that section you don't need uh the HTTP Pi thing is optional you can just move on to the next piece you're done here this is what we need to hook up our app you'll see where this comes into play in the next Lab but this is where uh we hook up our app to the database so if again if you got there you're good to move on if the password field is empty you may have just not entered it Ashan um so what I would do um is just go ahead and run the script again and just paste in these values here make sure when you hit enter you say please enter your password and enter that in it should fill it out all right let's see Games Collection Roman is referring to the document that we're going to store in the database once we get to that part in the app that's actually in the next section so you'll see where that where that glue comes together where that Association of what is this for that's where that'll come into play um Petro uh that's a great question I want to take it um live uh because other people have the same question um uh we're using EMV in a a prototype um uh you can of course environment variables that you netlify and in GitHub um you can have secrets through your database this simply allows you to um to work with uh this this system and I'm fairly certain that um that it's uh react that's using that um and uh I I'm sure they have other ways of setting your environment various FS as well so just think of this as a proof of concept um and of course in production uh you would want to use whatever your team's uh um processes are for uh protecting Secrets how many games will fill a cap of 5 gig quite a few you'll find that these documents don't take up very much space so yeah that would be that would be a lot Donovan um do you have to create the Games Collection so what's going to happen is this in the next section when we get to uh when we move on to this Implement a crud API that's where the that's where the game's document piece is going to come into play so you're going to see in the code where you're going to hook that up so you know since we've already stubbed it out we know it's going to be there that's why we're setting the environment for it now but you're going to hook that up the you don't actually have to explicitly create you're going to do that in the code using the API right it's actually like really really simple too it's literally going to take a Jason blob and just store as a document um so it the API the document API is going to do that for you it's going to create the document in the database for you yeah um maybe we should uh are we about um in good a a good place to kind of show and tell the hdp stuff or do you want to wait a little bit yeah you know um you know I just realized something and I don't know I think I know how uh we did this I think h G Pi stuff is not going to work until we create battle sax games which doesn't exist yet I actually found that it did let's give it a shot I me he's actually he the person who tried the HTP command was actually trying the second HTP command so I'm not sure what was going on there okay um so I figured we could go through it well here let me do it all right now we know I you know so if you have G pod this is already here uh it won't hurt to put it there again but like I said I've already got it now I do know because I failed to add a piece of code that I should have um that I'm going to need to edit this well let me just uh take a quick moment to talk about why we have hpy as a tool so again um David has done a great job of describing uh Stargate gives you different ways uh apis to access your database one of the things that people have complained about with Cassandra in the past is that it's really kind of challenging to understand how to interact with it so uh we have a rest API we have a graphql API which is getting even better soon and we have this document API and the document API is just a a it's like it's like mongodb so mongodb stores things in collections and their Json and it uses the Json to determine what to give you back so um what I've created oh yes I see you have two defaults you must have read it twice I did yeah and I deleted the extra one yeah um so uh so what we have given people uh as examples are some curl um commands if you're familiar with curl almost everybody is the problem is that those commands can be very bulky um it's hard to know which things you need to set and um it it it just puts a lot of friction on on exploring the database um HTT Pi is like curl but it's really aimed at uh API interaction it's it's a you know you set some um values in an RC file um and then um I wrote a plugin so that it could do the Astra authentication for you so um one of the things about the Astra authentication that's going to be improved soon is that we have our tokens expire um after 30 minutes of activity and so you have to go get another one but so hgp actually does that for you it sees that you're token has expired it gets you another one you didn't have to do anything you just call that end point so um we have um we have some an example of walking through um what we've got so um let's look at that first command which is um creating the document it's over on the left oh yeah I already grabbed it and I I hope it works because I can't really see what the letters are on your screen um let's um there let's try that wow very yeah that's I was that's why I was thrown by this uh the fact that it was saying that you must create the namespace first um really okay so uh maybe I had created it oh already yeah I'm wondering that same thing that's exactly what I was thinking why don't we why don't we uh Circle back to this after we do a couple of the other things okay and and uh see what we can do with that okay so and we've got about 15 minutes left I know that we want yeah so Samuel I see it yes about 15 minutes um matter of fact um that is this this piece here now there is a little bit more we're running a little bit behind but the good thing is once you get um to this point and you have the crud piece working you'll see how everything works together if you can't stay that's totally good I think we'll push a little bit past so we can actually push this to production but that's going to be the the end piece is pushing into production all right so with that let's go ahead and move forward into the next section and we'll go ahead and set a timer real quick all right cuz I do want to be able to get through these and we'll do some of the quiz part to wrap up yeah Ruben we'll we'll pull out those questions again don't worry I want to make sure everybody can get to a happy path um and get through the yeah Jan LCA what we're going to do is after this next section here uh right here lab S I believe the HTP Pi stuff will work properly I think we both realize Kirsten and I that uh we may have had a database in in place already when we tested by accident and so we kind of uh threw off the order of things we should have added this the HTTP Pi part probably the end of this section so let's go ahead and do this one first and we'll come back around and I should point out if you want to right you'll see this this section right here at the very bottom of Step 3A it says for a full cold solution if you open that up it's got the whole thing so you can just grab it if you if you need to for [Music] hm I wonder oh that looks good yeah I think I see what I did I I think I did a uh cut and paste error yep yep I okay so oh that's great so I I actually I made a mistake in my own when I was cutting or copy pasting uh which I'm now going to fix and I think from some of the errors that I'm seeing some from some other folks I wonder if they did the same thing I fat fingered that so the key space So the instructions that we have here are to go to the battle battle Stacks key space I fat I personally fat fingered in battle stack DB by accident which is why from hddp and other things it's not working because I put the wrong keyspace name in so something we should point out um if you want to verify this for one if you take a look if you if you go to connect and you look here you'll see this key space see this so if it's not battle Stacks if it's something other than battle Stacks you need to use that value instead right so if I go back to the HTP Pi command we used earlier and if instead of battle Stacks I use battle Stacks DB I have a feeling this is going to work just fine there it goes yeah yeah it's because I I fat finger the key space so double check if you're running into that issue or if you ran into that double check your keyspace name and again the instructions we set it up to be kind of homogeneous for battle Stacks but in fact if you're not using battle Stacks you're using something else um then you need to update that in the instructions and such I wonder if the games collection will get automatically created if um you have the correct um key space yes that's exactly what happens yes if you have the correct if the if you didn't fat finger it like I did right when we created the um uh the keyp space in the database to begin with the keyspace should have been battle Stacks so if that was correct and then you've you know they well I'm just wondering if the HP Pi command would actually have worked because it was referring to a database a key space that you didn't have uh yeah it did work that's what I did I don't know if you saw me do it I did it a moment ago I I put it toore DB and it worked just fine yeah so that's what it was it was just referring to a keyspace that didn't exist because I fat fingered it yeah oh great job hum drunk or hum jerk sorry um hey David did you want to paste the um the form to uh H and D direct yeah I'll I'll put it up because I know we are coming um I know we're going to go a little over but it sounds like some people probably need to go so I will paste the form because all of you have stayed with us this time it's only fair that you go get the thing that uh the nice little gift we're going to give you so give me just a moment I'll do that Ariel SQL cql is the Cassandra um query language it's not C it's not SQL I mean it's very confusing but it's not SQL it's cql you know funny enough though cql is a subset of SQL um yeah so um but but you know a lot of people uh have found it uh challenging to you know ramp up on cql uh which is why we're offering these other ways to interact with your data oh good and I'm seeing more and more folks are getting up and running so that's great that's great okay so here's what I'm going to do real quick I'll I'll paste this again at the end but I just pasted a link for all of you that link is going to bring you to this giveaway claim form right um what you can do is in order here's the giveaway right you probably saw this in the in the publication or the promotions for this so we're going to give you one or two things you can either get free vouchers to take your Apache Cassandra certification for free that's two tries for free those are 145 bucks a piece right or you can get a $300 credit to use on Astra now again we're using the free tier that is free forever that doesn't change but if at some point you decide that you want to like you know upgrade to one of the paid tiers then we'll give you 300 bucks um and that is simply for coming here you've you've created your database so all you need to do the instructions will explain it but all you need to do is you come into uh your database here and you'll see you have the cluster ID you just paste that in with the email you use to register today and that'll be enough to get you one of those two things make sure you choose one option of what you want um and submit it and that's it and that is something we're giving to you today for coming and spending time with us as well like I said we're still not done we're going to go a little bit further I know some of you guys are invested in that swag quiz um so we try we try to really keep um the voucher is valid for 3 months after the time you claim it right um so once you get once you get your voucher though and you go to take your exam if you pass that's good forever right that certification is good forever but the voucher is 3 months okay ah all right let's see now let's see where did we end up getting to now this point and again I'll say all that again later I just want to make sure that folks have to leave uh they do see that so at this point hopefully you are all to where you can run this last test um and you run mpm run test functions and you see both insert game and hello world do their thing the key thing though is that if insert game works if that's hooked up properly here's where you can really get it right once I every time I run this test right then it's going to create a new entry in the database because each one of these is a new document let me fix this because I totally fat fingered it right and you'll see that all the tests that I'm running I'm going to get those um also this ABCD that was from HTTP PI right so you'll start to see this this interaction you start to see that okay my database credentials are correct because this is functioning and working oh what's the extra as uh in um YouTube what's the extra $300 credits of Astra so when you create a database in Astra if I go back if I add database you see these other tiers right there's all sorts of other tiers in here um where you can get a lot more compute and storage and such this is where now you're starting to go away from the free tier which is a little bit more throttle and controlled and going into the higher tiers where you can go all the way up to Enterprise level workloads right um and that $300 for what for the A5 I think that'll that'll buy you like a month easy right or more than that I want to say it's actually the N A10 um so this is now where you're starting to you're starting to get into real clusters right the free tier is still a real Cassandra cluster but it's very small and throttled it's only meant for experimenting and doing quick development with it's not meant to host your real application again so that's really where the difference comes into play all right um as far as recommendations you know it really comes down to what are you trying to do um if you are interested in getting a certification and you want to be able to have that badge of honor use that for potential jobs or whatever then I would suggest going that route um there's a shortage of Cassandra people who have Cassandra knowledge whether they're admins or developers on Cassandra um there is plenty of Cassandra out there but the one thing we hear time and time again from so many of our clients and and Partners is that there are not enough people who know cander well so if you if that's interesting to you go for the certification otherwise if you think you could if you think that Astro might be something that you'd want to use and you want to up the level on it then there's where the credits come into play and either way both both courses are are are free so you can take them both and decide where you want certification in so you'll still have the knowledge yeah Reuben as far as resources to study um if you choose the uh if you were to choose the certification route let me go ahead and just get you something real fast for those folks that are doing that and then we're going to get back to the content because I want to make sure we finish this off here we go so we do actually have a workshop that we do specifically on certification there's link I just dropped it there you go awesome good and then you can take a look at the material in that in that repo that app point you to all the resources you need for certification okay so let's go ahead and see where we are on things we could just quickly run through the HTP stuff since that first one actually worked yeah now that we know yeah now that we know that what it was let's go ahead and do that while people are finishing up let me get to it we'll just be I'll just talk fast MH as if I don't here we go all right let me I just need to modify each of those commands all right go for it um no I was gonna you were going to do it and I was going to follow okay all right so um so the first thing that he did um can you up up arrow to the HTP command that you ran oh you're not seeing it are you huh here I got it right here oh okay um and uh you said you ran it and it worked yes let me do it again it keeps putting a carriage return right there we [Music] go so helpful there you go all right um so uh the first thing that you're going to do is you're going to uh create a new document and you're going to you're going to name it now um if you look through the documentation for the document database um you'll find that you actually can have it assign an ID for you but um that doesn't actually work out well so that didn't look good is there oh yeah try again um that one I have a successful run okay good so um so if you look one of the things that I want you guys to know is that you can in fact um put and create a configuration file for HTTP and you can just drop a question in uh Discord later for and I'll I'll talk to you about how to do that but you can basically say I always want to use AI Astra and I just want you to usually use the default section um so uh the next thing we're going to do uh you can actually run it with uh verbosity turned up and it'll tell you more stuff um and then let's check out retrieving it so we're doing um you can see that this is um the the HTP verbs so put and post and and get um as you work through so let's look at the get Step 2 C yep yeah go ahead I forget the delay oh what what do you need Kirsten no uh uh go ahead and do that the the retrieve the document I did so they can see okay and then um what um what do we have um and we can uh see uh the most recent game uh if you just put um games The Collection okay done right and um you can actually say uh I want uh 10 games back from the database so that's that last one uh with the page size um equals 10 right you can see all those games that we've created so far some came from my test some came from HTTP PI right ah I know I don't have your your screen with me so I'm talking to um historical you yeah I'm in the past yes Everything's Relative so um and then you need to do the page size yeah yes yeah and that's you must you must be way behind on that yeah from the lag standpoint because I do have that up right now okay great so anyways um this shows you that uh you're used to using something like curl to to put things in your database to grab things out of your database it's really fast way to test from anywhere if you don't happen to have a SQL uh a cql uh console available um so uh we we put that out there for you guys to play with and enjoy uh so uh give it a shot and let us know what you think alrighty all right so what we're going to do let's go ahead and get caught up um I know that uh let's see I saw a good amount of folks uh did in fact get to the end test right where they are testing um and if you've gotten to that point um then you're in good shape right this is looking real good because once you've got to the test here and you can run insert game you know and then you can verify that in the database right you know that it is in fact creating documents so you know that you're you're probably set up pretty good there let's go ahead and move to uh the next set of questions come back to some of those all right I'll give everybody a moment this is again for the swag quiz I'll give you a moment to get in here and I'll put it back up on the screen just in [Music] case okay again menty code is 9123 28 [Music] all right and let's go ahead and do it start this quiz what is [Music] Stargate a new Mario game a TV show a data API to give you rest graphql document on Cassandra a gateway to the Stars I realized I may have had the same answer in two places gateway to the Stars that's right that's the funny answer [Music] anyway all right so funny enough for those who answered a TV show that is also correct because it is but yes it is a data API to give you rest graph ql and document apis on Cassandra and let's take a look at our [Music] leaderboard see if this this looks like and oh bethoven was the fastest pulls into second aerial still end the top end Vivic number three now what I'm going to do here is because we've already done lad s cuz I was getting it a little ahead let's go ahead into the next question since we're all in here and ready to go all right using netfi serverless functions can be deployed locally and in the cloud Maybe no [Music] yes and let's see what happens yes is the correct answer yes they can be I like if you answered I wonder if you know what I'm referring to I'd love to know in the chat if you uh if you got that one um but yes the answer is in fact yes um you can that's actually one of the really cool features as far as I'm concerned right is from especially from the development standpoint when you configure those the access is the same reg regardless if you're local or if you're deployed um so that makes you know finding them and knowing how to interact with them pretty seamless no matter if you're you know just developing or if you're actually deployed all right let's see what our leaderboard looks like [Music] oh look at that HL H Lis lus sorry has I'm so sorry I'm saying that wrong every time has pulled back into third uh inan in second and Ariel keeps the lead all right so we'll have one more question but for now this is the This is the End right here right we're getting into the part where you get to deploy this application into production so let's see let's go ahead and do it so we're going to go to lab eight we're going to move on to the button here and again we do understand that if some of you have to drop off this won't take too too long um but that's why we dropped the form a little bit early for you there you go all right so let's go ahead and set that timer let's get going cuz I we like I said we do try to keep things on time here we're just a little behind so we appreciate you sticking around there's the timer for 10 minutes and this is this is for all the noodles right here um at this point you're going to take all the stuff you've done you're going to push that up you're going to push it to production and then you actually get to see it work and one thing I want to point out right here we do say it here this section you're going to go back don't forget you need once you've pushed your changes up you need to go back into your repository and PR those changes in or Master is not going to it's not going to do anything right so that's what we're referring to here um there is a reference back to lab to if you need it but if you're familiar with how to do PO requests and everything this should feel again this is kind of a process that you get used to and so I'm pull requesting in the changes I just pushed for is [Music] [Music] all [Music] by the way if you're at this part and I know you want to see your own code work so that's part of why we have my Branch that's totally cool um so if you commit your changes to my Branch I'm going to show you a little cheat the super secret full game option at the very bottom if you're getting stuck and you're like is it my code what's going on my test pass but something's not working you could go to the super secret full game option it's so secret so super secret and what you're going to essentially do is you're going to overwrite master with the full game which is absolute working code right and when you do that it will go ahead and deploy and if that deployment works you know it's something in code right and then you can always switch back to my branch and what you essentially do is you reverse you say get push um DF origin my Branch Master if you want to then re overwrite Master with my Branch to get you back but that is one way if you are kind of like not sure if it's the code or whatever you could just use the full game that's cheating but you could do it that way well and then once once you have a directory uh that has uh the full game uh you can actually do a diff um you know with what you had and figure out um where the where the difference is so it's very helpful that way too woohoo yay we got people chomping at the bit for minty I know right we're GNA do it we're gonna do it we're so close we only got a couple more minutes we can do it [Music] see how we're doing on the completions almost there almost there [Music] I want to thank you guys I mean we still have 107 people watching and um and that's really fantastic I mean we're so excited that you guys stayed with us and um and you get to play and uh have fun with our stuff so [Music] woohoo Sean yay why thank you M4 R4 so she Maria has been with us before in a in a previous workshop and when I saw her name I think it pulled I think she popped up on a me on a menty actually and um uh and I just didn't see the lead speak for Maria I just didn't see it so I was like M4 R I4 and I so then we actually ended up talking after um uh we connected out in Discord and we were chatting about some of the workshops and everything and then realized her name is Maria um so now she is M4 R4 oh it's okay coms 52 you're or I should say m creete yeah you're right there you're so close if you're on part seven you know the DJ tutsy I've not been following um I've not been following the particular issue you're having in cql but if you had any issue like I did where I had by accident fat fingered my key space name then the query that we gave you was for battle stack so we're because that's we set this hole up so you're using that that's why we ask everybody to use those values so if your key space per chance happens to be different like what I did you'll need to up that in order for it to work so I don't know if that's what's happening but I wonder yeah let me here uh J Luka I will drop the form again for you here you go because that form is important and again it is a thank you for coming here and spending time with us there you go all right we're almost there everybody yeah there Asos to in uh YouTube totally right um web development is is is a whole different ball game now than it was like in the 90s right I mean who who here remembers if I could see some thumbs up days when you know if you were a web developer people just thought all you did was edit HTML files that was it it has grown and expanded in its complexity um I would argue that web development in the languages that are there is every bit as complex as anything I've ever done in C C++ you know Java whatever um it's it's no longer I don't I don't think it can any longer be classified as oh that's not development for decades now honestly and and now with this kind of capability right the fact that from a front-end development standpoint you can go end end with a deployment like this I think I find that [Music] exciting all right so let's see we are okay so the time there is up and I know we're over so hopefully some of you gotten to a point where you now have the front end here if you say start new game it'll generate a new code if you then go up to your database and look my code was grvl and now there it is grvl wonderful so now I know that up here this is if you notice this is my this is my production URL right and if I take a look at my deploy I go back one here this is that last PR that I pushed this went to production right this is actually in production so that means too um that in my functions my insert game servus function is now functioning right this is actually a Ser it's a microservice that's sitting out there um with an API that my code is using to interact with the database and do things and all I had to do was drop it into a functions folder and um you know export a Handler and here boom it's it's now available as a serverless function I mean that's just so cool it is so cool um so anyway hopefully you got to that point now you might notice though you can't do anything else you saw me earlier go to a Lobby if you try to do that it's not going to do anything why because it's at this point we've only implemented part of the application as I mentioned before there is the super secret game option that is down here if you want to do that that'll give you the full game or you can play the whole thing and and play around with it plus you'll see the fully working code I mean this is all open source you can take this and do whatever you want with it um so have at it and have fun with that why don't we get into the last question because I know people were chomping at the bit as you mentioned it would only be fair that we do that people about their swag right swag is important everybody wants a goodie everyone wants their swag all right so let's do it and all right one more time give everybody a moment to get in what kind of backend framework does Jam sack require spring boot asp.net Jango this is a trick question why are you so mean [Music] [Music] see who got this right yes this is a trick question why are you so mean it's totally a trick question I'm a jerk I know um jam stack does not require a backend framework that's that's kind of the idea that's the point so yes I was being a jerk there um I'm glad to see most of you got that right all right let's see what our board looks [Music] like I mean at least you made it easy because uh the other options were not anything we did anything with today I hope right right all right so Ariel congratulations you got number one and again number two and the persons whose name I have now butchered like five times in a row H lasas um you'll have to tell me this is like M this is like Maria with M4 ri4 really this is the same thing so maybe you can give me a phonetic spelling but for the top three winners here please what I want you to do we'll tell you here how to do this email Jack fryer jack. fryer jack. fryer oops prior at data Stacks now this next part is important don't just email Jack but take a picture take a screenshot of your win we need a screen screenshot of your win send it along over to Jack frier there and you will get your swag right now give you have to give Jack a little time to um to respond and everything it does take a little time you know a couple days or whatever to to process things and respond and all that um but yes send send an email to jackf sex.com don't again take a picture of your win send that along to get your swag and oh yeah es can yes sth is close that's absolutely right now the relationship here doesn't need to be done today right um we are on Discord we're in LinkedIn um we're all over the place and we want you to come and and you know to come hit us up if you have questions if you follow up I do know that some some of you weren't able to get through all of the exercises and that's okay um this is meant to be self-service you know by the way since it's using all free toer stuff it's all things that you can just delete and not have to worry about it it's not it's not a bad thing sometimes to just start over and go through the instructions again maybe there was something missed or whatever um but feel free to come reach out we want to improve our workshops we're always looking for feedback um we're not perfect so if you've got stuff that you found I you know like one example would be that emsh somehow I have no idea how but some of you didn't even have the file I'm kind of lost on that one um but we'll have to figure it out right so with that thank you everybody so much and just to kind of like a final summary of things just take stock of what you did today and what you can do with jamstack you just deployed a fully front stack app right and I'm just going to go over this stuff through a full cicd Pipeline with GitHub actions using servus functions it's globally available through a CDN on netfi and you're leveraging like the top nosql distributed database with a document API in aache Cassandra I mean like there were all these things that all just happened and you all stayed with us and you did them with us together so we really appreciate you coming on your involvement and your attention today um I hope you got something out of this and we hope to see you again in the future and with that Kiren any final words or no I I this was great this was the the first Workshop where I got to be the color commentator so that was excellent um I I learned that um Skype sometimes wants you to reboot your computer I they're owned by Microsoft now right so so that makes sense anywayss um uh but you guys had great questions you stayed right on it um you know you're we're gonna definitely um you know take that feedback and make our instructions even better um and I I do hope I see uh some of you at one of our future workshops agreed absolutely so with that thank you everybody again feel free to reach out to us outside of what we're doing here once the stream ends the video will then show show up it'll it'll be there on YouTube so you can take a look at it again um but if any of you guys had any troubles come reach out you know we're we're happy to help with that see you everybody Take Care thank you so much and we'll see you next time and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that Bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of Cassandra you grew those Powers until she can multiply it will move with limit speed and unmasked hidden knowledge with those Powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous feats",
