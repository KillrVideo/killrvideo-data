  "title": "Working with Cassandra as GraphQL API using Stargate.io",
  "description": "When the Stargate GraphQL API is added to an existing Cassandra deployment, it automatically creates HTTP endpoints that expose GraphQL queries and mutations for the objects that it finds in the database. You can also create new database tables directly via the API. The built-in GraphQL Playground servlet makes it easy to prototype your mutations and queries and experiment with new approaches.\n\nThe Stargate GraphQL API comes in two \"flavors\":\nCQL-first: you provide the CQL tables, Stargate generates the GraphQL schema. \nSchema-first: you provide a GraphQL schema, Stargate generates the tables.\nIn this demo we'll show both, and explain how to switch from one to the other.\n\nLearn more: https://www.datastax.com/dev/graphql\n\nCONNECT WITH DATASTAX\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/datastaxdevs?sub_confirmation=1 \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/datastaxdevs\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/datastaxdevs\n\nAbout DataStax:\nDataStax is the company behind the massively scalable, highly available, cloud-native NoSQL data platform built on Apache Cassandra™.

    "text": "foreign the capabilities of Stargate graphql API I am Krishna narayana Swami and I'm based out of Melbourne I started my career as a software RND engineer and I've built number of great products across different organizations I specialize in apis Cloud native Technologies databases streaming platforms and kubernetes what is graphql graphql is an API query language and a server side runtime that allows us to transfer data between applications originally created by Facebook and then open sourced in 2015. GitHub uses graphql and they announced in 2016. another example is Netflix uses Cassandra and graphql together to serve extremely fast answers to specific questions that their consumers are asking from their mobile devices graphql is becoming very popular HTTP based API nowadays one of the primary reason is the client applications declare the data they want in one car and they don't have to care how the backend systems retrieves that information now this reduces number of network round trips and the client is in control of the data that is being transferred it reduces overfetching and under fetching data with other apis such as rest now when the application evolves and when new Fields can be accessed through the API without modifying the application code or the logic graphql also allows aggregating data from multiple sources with one API endpoint this pattern is often called as data Federation now applications like can militarily minimize the number of requests using graphql right a good example of where it can be used is mobile or iot applications where using less bandwidth or saving battery really matters another example is when an application needs nested data to be fetched in a single car for example a blog or social media networking platform where posts need to be fetched along with nested comments and commenters details for example let's look up look at how we would Implement right now what you see on the slide there is that if the client is actually specifying exactly that they need title from a model incoming workshops for example or from the table that stores the workshop information now a query is a read-only dialect which uses uh used primarily to fetch data from the server using graphql sdl syntax that you see there now notice that we can also pass parameters especially date that you see on the on the slide there other capabilities that the graphql system or type system allows with built-in scalar types like integer float string Boolean ID and also use a defined types now you can create structure with constraints here right now this is very very important so it's it's kind of a tight schema where you can have number of different validations on operations that the client is performing when we speak on operation so mutations are the key here right so they are used to change any resource data or execute an action on the server now in today's demo we are going to see Astra DB right so Astra DB is a SAS offering from data stacks that is essentially Cassandra that runs on the cloud and there's a Stargate API layer that sits on top of the database that allows you to query information we offer I mean Stargate offers rest draft ql and document API so today we'll see the demonstration of graphql and then there's also a playground which you will see on the demo so essentially allows you to interact and try out some of the graphql queries out there foreign API has two modes right so one is native graphql schema principles uh developed with the CQR that is the Cassandra query language in mind the SQL first approach directly translates SQL tables into graphql types mutations and queries now the schema graphql schema is automatically generated from the key space tables and the columns defined but no customizations are allowed now a standard set of mutations and queries are produced for searching and modifying the table data right so if you are familiar with Cassandra you might prefer this approach now there's also another approach which is the schema first approach that allows you to create graphql types mutations and queries in a manner familiar to graphql developers the schema is developed and can be updated by deploying new schema without recreating the tables and columns directly we will see both the approaches in the demo today now what is sort of the difference between rest API and graphql right so in my opinion graphql is a better rest right it naturally integrates with the rest ecosystem now as you see in the picture with rest API you would typically gather data by accessing multiple endpoints like players teams in these cases right now with graphql on the other hand you would simply send a single query that and then you can query data from multiple different tables in one call right just optimizing uh Network traffic and and so on and so forth now with the rest with number of different um endpoints you you get to cache data per end point but with graphql you get one endpoint so caching might become little bit difficult but at the same time that can be solved through other tools like upper low graphql and so on and so forth right but it is extremely easy for developers to onboard graphql into their development ecosystem right and the the graph that you see there uh kind of um illustrates what I was talking about so as you can see the graphql usage has been increasing over the last years now let's go and see a demo of um what we have been talking so far okay so this is uh data Stacks Astra so I'm just going to sign into the console here I've already created the key space which is essentially and the Cassandra database already so today we are going to use uh the graphql demo database and it's got a key space graphql demo right so let's go ahead and create um some tables now so I'm going to navigate into um I'm going to navigate into the graphql demo key space and I'm going to create a table okay so I've already created let's insert some data into the table temp reading here now I've inserted one record and I'm also going to insert another one so let's make sure if we have got um the data so select start from um temp underscore reading so as you can see it's pretty much like SQL right so that's that's the advantage of CQR um now let's go into the graphql playground so um what I have done is I've added the HTTP Adder which is the Cassandra token to interface with that database here uh once it's done so I'm able to call and query as you can see the with the list of key spaces you get graphql demo as well now I'm going to create um so I'm going to go and query the schema now as you can see it's written in the um temp reading schema in essentially the same way that uh we had created using the cql in the console um now I'm going to go into the uh I'm gonna go into the specific graciel demo and issue a few queries to retrieve some data in here so let's grab um uh some sensor data with specifying the sensor ID here and and we are specifying that these are the values that we need to query and we have got the two records that that we store right so now let's go ahead and run some aggregations here um what we're going to do is we're going to do an average of both the values that you see there um so let's try it now so you can see that it has averaged out the the sensor value there we specify that we want to average here um now let's let's try and uh insert some new data in here so for inserting or updating we use the mutations so I'm using this a new sensor ID and I'm inserting a value 55. and and it's already applied through uh now let's go and check if we have got uh the data that we inserted through graphql here okay perfect so now you see that there are three records okay now let's go and modify um or add a new table and see that it reflects uh immediately right so let's go and create a new table in our console here uh SQL console uh this is a new table sensor info and I'm going to insert um new data into it okay let's go back and query this from graphql playground okay so I'm just going to issue a query and now I'm going to query from Center info this time [Music] as you can see um the sensor info data is uh retrieved from the table okay so now we have completed the cql first approach now we are going to uh try and do the schema first approach so I'm going to change this to uh sort of the graphql admin so that we are able to issue some of the scheme offers so here the we're going to create the graphql schema and that is actually going to create the tables and and everything on the line right so we came from the tables created through cql and Liberty I mean just calling from graphql now we're going to go the other way now so so this is uh the sort of the mutation so where I'm saying deploy a schema in the graphql demo and I'm saying that the table name is product and and the query and and so on and so forth right and and I'm saying I want to be able to query by skus and category and so on right so let's go and issue this command and and you see that there is a new uh sort of version number for that schema generated so I'm just going to copy this uh for my future use in the demo this one sec perfect um okay now so I'm gonna go into uh so the mutation and um insert some data into the products table but before that let's go and see if I've got um the products table let's describe that uh so describe table and say product for that matter yes so as you can see that the product table is already created through the schema that we created in here so let's go ahead and um insert now let's also refresh this and see our schema has got the product SKU name and all of that yes perfect they have all that let's go ahead and insert some data so as you can see we have inserted three skus let's try and query them now so I'm going to query by products foreign name as we asked now we we created an index on sort of the um category so we're going to pass that index into the graphql query saying categories electronics and see if we get the data yeah so perfect now we're going to see by updating the schema right and now when we update the schema automatically it reflects uh into our table schema as well so we're going to see that now um just give me a while while I'm getting the uh command ready for it yep perfect um okay so let's walk through so I'm just going to do a dry run first to ensure uh if it's intact so I've got the same version number that I had before and um let's do a dry run and see that now um so mutation deploy schema oh I'm sorry I'm doing it at the wrong uh one that's good good to have validations let's go and do it at the right one where I need to be doing it the graphql admin perfect so yes so we are adding a new column rating as you see here which we are updating the schema and and also the query so now let's remove the Dryden and is all looking good I am looking good with the version so now yes I got the version and and the thing is updated I'm going to refresh now and see if my schema is updated yes I see that um schema is updated too perfect so let's go and query with rating now if we are able to see um the records the effect I see narrating now that's that's expected perfectly now we're going to see a bit of federation now so I have a small demo prepared for that so what essentially this is doing is that you've got the upper low Gateway on top and then the uh like the products schema that we created and the table and the inserted view skus there so that data is going to come from the catalog service there and I have another mock orders or node.js which gets some dummy data now this single query is going to actually get the products and also um so it's going to get products Q name and category so this category is going to come from the Astro database graphql endpoint right and the sqa and the names is going to from going to come from that dummy SQL so this is more of how you create a data Federation so let me go ahead and start the microservices in the background just give me a moment so once I start I should have the upper low Gateway started as well okay I see that it's listening in about four thousand um so let's go ahead and create a new tab and let's uh maybe just park in your local loss 400 right and then what I'm going to do now is I'm going to query the order id1 and then SKU name and category and let's see if I I can retrieve data there you go so the categories and and other details are coming from Astra DB and few static data is coming from uh from the taurus.ph.js file where there is a few hard-coded data in here right and then uh the rest of the other data is coming from uh from the Astra database so thank you so much for joining me today hope you enjoyed the demonstration",
