    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems welcome everyone distributed data show i'm live in the studio today my name is Patrick McFadden and with me I have Jeff carpenter and live from Denver I have Luke Tillman Lou friends and always in Florida he doesn't seem to ever want to leave that would be David Gilardi hello no I like to point out where you are just so people know we're so international and remote it's so cool Florida and very young Florida is international it is much I did have an international now we're not anymore so we need to get some people from another country but Florida is pretty close pretty close every time I go there I feel like I'm in a different country most people from outside the US don't get that all right so this is a today we brought we brought us a new guest here and this is actually pretty exciting because this is something I've been using quite a bit lately it's about Davis tech studio and we have Bob Bridey on who's going to tell us a little bit about visualization of graph databases and it is the hot topic let's face it graph is the cool kid right now and for good reason it's got a lot of sizzle to it but let's get into practice so Bob welcome thanks for having me are you are you ready for the round robin of questions I think I'm ready all right Bob I just want you to know I'm jealous of your beard it's cool if you work on it you can catch up thanks though there's no beard shaming on the distributed data show okay so Bob can you tell us a little bit about your background like where you came from what do you know what is your experience and let people know who you are sure so I think with this that's for a few years and I joined the company via acquisition I was a member of the Orillia scheme I was a crew of seven guys seven developers we work on things like Titan open source craft database and tinkerer pop and I was consultant with that team and then data stacks acquired really as I joined data stacks and since then I've been primarily focused on the data stack studio project which we're going to talk about today with specific focus on graph visualization and interaction alright so question to you Bob what is the core purpose of studio I want to hear this yeah so studio is really at its course it's a developer enabling tool and what I mean by that is if you think about the folks that are using data stack Enterprise they're writing C 12 queries Brian gremlin traversals profiling those things for optimization building applications they be doing some some data management tasks things of this nature studio is our attempt to enable them to make their lives as easy as possible and accomplishing those tasks nice so one of the things that's a little bit different about studio with respect to some of the tools that we've had in the past like the cql shell just is still a great tool and the old dev center product studio is a little different right because it has this this notebook type of format which is a little bit different might be new for some people yeah you know notebooks have been around for a long time they go at least all the way back to the early MATLAB days maybe even earlier that I don't know and they've definitely started to pick up steam we're seeing it more and more often now and when we look at the different ways that we could deliver this product different ways to enable development the notebooks really stood out to us because they just hit such a wide variety of use cases like there's just so much cool stuff you can do in a notebook right so as a developer I use the notebook all the time when I'm writing gremlin and it's a great way to organize my thoughts in a top-down flow so I haven't notebook it's a collection of cells each cell is its own little idea or traversal and it makes it really easy for me to work through those things save my thoughts I can come back that later revisit what I was working on see the result all that sort of stuff but it's also really useful for folks who are doing presentations maybe building tutorials for others to consume and you know it's definitely when we took a step back and looked at all the things that it enables we thought hey this is a no brainer we're gonna we're going to build a notebook yeah the notebook the notebook thing is definitely hot I mean it's not a solid graph databases are pretty close and there's been some that are really specific around a language for instance Jupiter which used to be ipython notebook that was a very Python eccentric notebook and sparc notebook which is very specific to spark but what is it that studio what languages does studio support yes so for studio like I said we're trying to enable developers who are working with data stacks enterprise so the features that we put into studio are very specific to that we started with support for gremlin and then in 2.0 we released support for cql so that's what we have so far for each of those we have a really best-in-class top of the line editor experience you're not going to find better cql or gremlin editing capabilities anywhere else right now I'm not I'm not at all shy about saying that it is the best out there right now along with that we have really nice interactive schema visualization capabilities so when you're writing your traversals writing your cql queries you can have your schema right there on the side of the screen always reminding you what's going on and in addition that we have profiling capabilities for each of those languages so when we put out support for language we really go for it you know we have smart editor we got schema visualization and we've got profile now I'm not a not a manager or an executive here but I like pretty charts and graphs just as much as the next manager seriously as Patrick no narrator loves pretty charts and graphs he loves us today what kind of like if I want to do visualization inside a studio what kind of data be used we have we actually have a pretty broad range of data zatia capabilities you know you never not never you won't hear me right now say that studio is a bi tool studio is not a it's not a bi tool it's not a full-fledged data analysis tool but to enable the task that I was talking about things like data management things like developing traversals and queries you do need some visualization tools so we have pretty good range those things starting from your very basic things like just a raw JSON view we have a table view you know pretty straightforward rows and columns that thing but then things start to get a little bit more exciting we have pie charts bar charts line charts line area and scattergram so pretty good range of you know your pervasive charting capabilities there as well as we have the graph view for visualizing your PSU graph data and then we also have the profile views for optimizing sequel and gremlin queries like I mentioned before and then lastly although it's not technically a data view we also have the schema reviewers that I talked about before to provide you a way to interactively examine your schema alright so just saying the shameless plug here real quick you know given the stuff you were talking about like the charting and some of the ways you can visualize things and cells in that kind of deal we have actually a whole set of videos in data section Academy right now that actually go through all those all the various capabilities matter of fact I kind of stole some your information Bob for the best to do that but anyway that's my famous blood go go take a look if you do search for studio and graph you'll you'll definitely find them in tech Academy definitely check that stuff out there's a there's a lot of good material there and I don't I don't mind the shameless plug at all happy to have folks checking that stuff out so this is the point where all of our listeners are going to pause the show and go to the sax Academy and watch that content and then they're going to come back but for those that don't do that how about we give them a demo live here on distributed data show can we do that let's do it let's check studio after you live live demo gods let's do this so what we're taking a look at here is a data stack studio notebook and you can see a bunch of these individuals and kind of like an org chart layout and represents the really talented and fantastic studio development QA and documentation team over here on the left-hand side this clump of individuals represents the development team and you can see that we all report to Shannon who is p.m. over here we have the QA folks who report to Rick and then over here is Jim who does documentation so let's imagine that we want to maybe look at like who's been around the longest in terms of how long they've worked at data stacks and I pre-populated some of that data so I'm just going to show off some of the graph visualization customization capabilities I'm going to say I want to size each vertex by how long they've been here and that's kind of cool but I want to get another dimension working so that my eyeballs can do a little bit more work and I'm going to say that I also want to color each of the vertices by that value and this is a good time to point out that this chart you know it doesn't look great right because I don't care that each person has a different number of days that they worked here that's not it's not a categorical value studio doesn't understand that because it's a domain agnostic tool it doesn't know what database X means but it does provide you the capability to come in here and figure it the way you want so I'm going to say I want to use a linear scale and now this is looking pretty good right I can see that the individuals that have been here the longest their vertices appear both larger and hotter in terms of the temperature of the color so it's a really good way to examine the structure of the network while also getting a rough understanding of some of the relative values in the data visual melody that would Kate exactly add yes yeah you can get like a so for those of you who are not watching and listening I mean this is very obvious to someone who's just taking a glance of the picture that there is a big difference between each one of these vertexes yeah and for some of them it can get a little hard to tell right like if you look over here on the side you can see this Bob that's me that in John we all joined right around the same time so we had a bear look very similar color and diameter on our vertex so this is when Studios multi data visualization capabilities really shine because I can jump down here into the next cell and I can say I want to look at specifically the data to data stacks I want to order by that and then I can create a bar chart so I'm going to come here for the bar chart I'm going to say I want my x-axis to be the individual in my y-axis to be how long I've worked here and wha-la studio automatically creates this really nice looking chart and I've rarely had to do any work to make it happen and just to reiterate none of this was pre-configured the work that you would do if you were starting from scratch I did it all right there so studio doesn't know anything about you know person for Texas or days of data stacks or anything like that doing this all on a fly which is pretty exciting one of the other visualizations I want to quickly show off is the gremlin profile view it's a little bit of an underrated feature it's one of those things where you don't realize how badly you need it until you really need it so what this is showing us is a collection of traversal steps and the x-axis represents how much time was taken to execute that step and you'll notice right away it's jumping out and showing me this red exclamation part and what exclamation point excuse me what that means is that we're we're not utilizing an index for this traversal that's a big red flag you would never want to do that in a production environment because your performance which is tanked it would be Turtles all the way so studio that provides a lot of insight into profiling this sort of thing this U is really useful when you start optimizing your gremlin traversals and it's just a really exciting tool to have out there because this sort of capability doesn't exist anywhere else so this has been a graphical explained plan basically no actually it's not there's there is also an explained step which is only interacting okay so there's more reason for it there is more so you can do it explain we'll take a look at that here this shows you this shows you the the query plan when I was setting about the profile view is that because of the dynamic nature of the VSC graph executors this actually analyzes traversal in real time because depending on the cardinality of your data it may choose you a lot of different indexes at runtime so the explains that actually is incapable of providing all the information you might be looking for that's why you execute this reversal and profile it then you get to see exactly what actually happened under the hood well that's really cool cool yeah so about so um you know I know we're primarily talking about Grendel and Larry right now but for the stuff you do show like the profiler and the charts and that kind of deal did it does that also work with tql yeah you know one of our kind of core tenants in the studio is that we want to be as consistent as possible across the features that we provide you know that that's just good us it should be consistent to the extent possible so for for the charting capabilities and the profiling that stuff is very very similar between cql and gremlins especially like the charting stuff it's it's almost identical so someone who learns one easily be able to do the other oh very cool okay all right so how about what I'm curious about this what do you think is the most underrated future in studio that you wish more folks kind of knew about yeah that's a tough call because uh like a proud parent a lot of the features are my favorite but in terms of which ones are underrated yeah there's definitely some that I feel are just super useful and and valuable that really I wish more folks knew about them because they are kind of hidden and I think the profiler is a big one but also um I had to pick the most underrated feature would probably be a schema aware content set whoa okay hold on schema aware countenance if that's a really fancy word for type-ahead am i right uh no not quite Patrick it's actually it's actually even better than that let's take a look yeah I want to see this so yeah I'm trying to visualize this and I don't think that we can explain it as well as you're going to be able to show it so show us what you got yeah Patrick let's just take a look at it I think it'll be a little easier to explain if we just kind of yeah through it I think this is a visual thing for sure yeah so what we have here is just a really kind of silly little example that represents a household and take a it's a schema you see that we have a person a person can own things like motorcycles and houses and cars and houses can have addresses and a person can also have a pet so let's imagine that I want to write a traversal using either this graph I'm going to say that I want to grab a dog so now I'm sitting on the vertex that represents a dog and I want to look at maybe the incoming edges so when I'm sitting here I'm going to hit control space this is going to trigger content assist and what you'll notice is that I only have my top recommendation a single edge label has pet so if we go over and we look at the scheme of what you can see is that studio was smart enough to not recognize edges it didn't recommend has address edges because it understands that those are reasonable choices based on the schema when you're sitting on a dog vertex so it's examining the traversal as you write it to figure out kind of where you are in your steps and it's also in near-real-time going out to D as you graph to fetch the schema so that it can make these kind of smart suggestions to highlight that a little bit more I'll just show a slightly different example let's say we started with a person and we take a look at the adjacent edges you can see that a person can have a pet and a person can also own things that has a dress edge label on the other hand is not recommended because it just doesn't make sense in terms of this schema now this might seem a little bit contrived and it certainly is but when you start to get you know real-world scenario type schemas that are more complex this stuff becomes hugely valuable especially when you start getting deeper and deeper in your traversal very easy to start to lose track and Oh what did I name that thing you're looking stuff up somewhere else and kind of distracting you from your flow not in-studio your your right here authoring your traversal getting smart content assist and you don't have to worry about going anywhere else to find all that information that's really yeah I mean that is absolutely true I think in when I was trying to come up to speed on gremlin that is the number one problem is where am I in this traversal ok what kind of nodes or edges am I on you can get lost really quick in a big ground yeah so Bob you're uh you're busy man and you work on a busy team what you know kind of can you give us hints maybe on what it is you guys are working on or something that we can look forward to in a future version so you know folks might kind of be aware of this but like as a developer one of the things that I'm trained to do is never commit to anything never give any public dates or anything like that though a little bit of a little bit of you know kind of crazy waters here but um you know I got permission to give you guys a couple hints a little a little a little a couple spoilers well case will do you they don't know yeah that's right so some of the things that we're really excited about that are coming up the first one possibly the most heavily requested studio feature to date is notebook import/export yeah it's exactly what it sounds like the village to you have that you can just stop yeah I said that no more is it good yeah yeah important important yeah and what's fun about this feature is that it solves a different use case for every different persona so if you're a person who does presentations and tutorials maybe like a Patrick or David Jeff you know you guys that are doing these Evangelist tasks you'll be able to write studio note both throw them out on the web folks will be able to download them upload them into their studio and consume that information so that's huge similarly if your documentation person you can write documentation examples to share with folks in the same way but at the same time if you're one of our customers you're a developer working on with against DSE maybe you run into some bugs sometimes you can use studio to create a reproduction of that that you can send off support so that you don't have to worry about like awkward code snippets or environment setup or anything like that it'll make it really easy for them to replicate what you're doing because they just upload their notebook and it should behave the same way and then lastly you know just inter team communication so as a developer working on a project you figured out this traversal you finally know that you want to share it with your coworkers you can just create a studio export they can upload it into their instant and try it out so yes it's going to be a really feature hits a lot of different use cases some of the other stuff that we're pretty excited about that we're working on right now is support for deity analytics so as I mentioned you know we really want to be the did that product development tool and to do that we have to we have to incorporate more of the capabilities and analytics is next on our list and then some of the other other things that we're looking at our like notebook versioning so for example I'm guilty that's all the time I think oh I should maybe make this even better but then I screw it up right and I want to get back to that spot where it was working correctly right now we have some like browser-based undo capabilities but it's really not great so we're going to add versioning to make it so that you get like you know well define milestones that you can go back to that'll be really useful for development and then the last the last big thing is coming up is graph interaction so we kind of saw how it's pretty easy to execute gremlin traversal that produces either graph vertices or edges and studio can display those things very easily it's automatic but we're things that tricky is you know maybe you just want to see a little bit more that you want to dive in and explore in an interactive fashion right now you can't do that but we're working on it so that will enable you to just kind of find a starting point and then you can say oh let me see what that is are off of this vertex and this one in this one dive in and out and move around and it'll also make the product a lot more approachable to folks that aren't fully up to speed yet on gremlin Thurmond does have a little bit of a learning curve so the interactive graph will be a way to ease in to examining your deity graph data wow that's really cool excellent so we're super excited about studio I think we're all big fans of it here and we really want to thank you Bob for coming on the show and talking with us today we look forward to maybe having you on some future episodes cool thanks for having me just a quick message to the listeners out there the studio users please don't be shy about reaching out to us if there's features that you're looking for bugs that you run into things you're confused about you know we're all like really really passionate about this project the development team everyone works on it we're really into it we'd love to hear from you so please don't be shy feel free to reach out dative Sachs Academy flack has a channel dedicated to studio please show up and be heard thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page
