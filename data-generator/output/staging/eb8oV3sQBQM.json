  "description": "In this episode Adron covers a range of topics around C#. First a quick review of upcoming shows on our Twitch channel. With that wrapped up he covers the https://dotnetfiddle.net/ web app that can be used to prototype C# code, and even port it to VB.NET and or VB.NET to C#.\n\nAdron then reviews the SchemaMigrationsExplorations project and the code - both C# and CQL - of what was covered in previous episodes. Then after walking through that makes the determination to start building an Apache Cassandra & DataStax Enterprise schema migration tool in C#. The remainder of the episode he then steps through the inception of this project, adding the appropriate projects and everything that is needed to get started coding. In addition, covering some basic user application stories to work against while building the application.\n\n -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/datastaxadevs",

    "text": "[Music] [Music] hello hello hello and welcome to a new seeker a matron your host on this walk in the C sharp forest I've got a couple things to go through today and that should be pretty interesting some of the stuff they were going to go through has been around for a while some of its super duper brand new it's a little more C sharp focus than beta focused today because I just wanted to cover some of the bases of tools that are out there to help you get things done on a daily basis from day to day today today so let's just let's just roll into this and we'll get my desktop up here for you all right so first thing a little call-out to upcoming twitch events and such here on day two stacks Academy right now we're looking at this episode but Friday on the 26 at 1:00 p.m. Jeff and David are gonna be diving into killer video application development they're gonna be doing a little bit more with the Python and graph work that they've been working on in in previous episodes and continuing on that then may 2nd the Thursday the aim to rate yeah is not the aim the thing we'll be diving into is another c-sharp our so I'll be posting what content I will be covering on the description of that real soon then on May 3rd that Friday I'm hoping Christina and I are both hoping to get episode 5 of building the Geo app trucks they're building which is food food trucks that we've been working on if scheduling conflicts come up though we might have to push that to a later date but right now we are scheduled for that and then we're definitely scheduled for May 7th on that another killer video application development on May 3rd and as you can see got some more C sharp hours coming up with that covered let's dive into dotnet fiddle so this is this is a completely online thing where you just go in here and and basically start writing some c-sharp for example this one just go ahead and say run and it's hello world so it spits this stuff out right there similar to some of the things that people put together for who sun is shining right in my face the people have put together for things like go and JavaScript it's here let's try to add a little thing just to just to see what we got here console.writeline it's got autocomplete which is real nice another line of text there we go and then run it boom they're going to the line of text that's exactly we wanted then let's credit it let's see what happens if we get input huh read let's actually do this let's do our something equals this and then we'll do the console.writeline something and that'll work for us so let's see what what does that do so run ah read not supported and it's a bummer so it's not really a console it's just output let's just make it say testing out the console that should run no problem yeah there we go so I think if you hit save yeah so you can do do a dotnet net fiddle Academy account or you can log in with Twitter or whatever and then save stuff so let's let me actually log in with my Twitter account make sure you activate it through a link sent to your email oh give me give me two seconds I'll go do that real quick hmm I don't see an email from them yet oh there it is cool okay so now I should be able to go in and off that way yeah so now we get other features here and should be able to go in I have favourites count my fiddles let's save it please enter a fiddle name just test-driving save it now I'm going here and go my fiddles it should show up yep there it is just go ahead and click it and should yep load it right back up so what else we got we got MVC Nancy script console c-sharp V 4.5 Roslin so that should be the basically same thing right so we can do auto run too and what's nice about that is let's say let's say public my ass something stuff this free light snack syntax here yeah oh yeah there we go and let's say public lloyd do this republic see about public static boy gonna do that yeah just takes a second for the squiggly line to disappear then we're gonna say return value here oh I'm being a dummy I'm returning a string so that's not should it be this either way do that and then let's say console.writeline [Music] something what did I call it get out of there and tell us sense something stuff dot do thing that should give us the code oh yeah there it is the value here so the autorun if you click yes it just basically saves it oh well what did i do there I don't want that it saves it and runs it every time you make a particular change I go in and just type console dot right stuff and semicolon should incur a save oops and yeah as you can see it ran it so that's pretty cool let's not save that let's hit new hey it gets me right back that to that convert to vb.net well let's let's do that that's Oh trippy haven't seen this in ages let's do public class see fit I want to see if it corrects the case appropriately some new glass in glass public shared so now I want to do that I want to do public is it just public string this I gotta say sub sub and then sub and here is return values forget how to I forget how it goes anyway heparin ever written vb.net in a thousand years and this is the c-sharp our well yeah so anyway you can go back and forth convert to c-sharp so you can take your vb.net stuff and put in their comes in real handy if you're porting something all right so that's that's one of the tools in our tool chests that we can use just to try things out like if you don't have an IDE or you don't have access to a machine with the.net CLR and stuff on it you can always use this as a quick demo site and then let's go ahead and get into writer again I'm going to dotnet resources and let's actually create a new notes file interesting out where'd it up with that on my oh it's saved that's the path for that say blink it's kind of weird-looking all righty sure let's do C sharp our episode 5 I believe we're on so there's that code episode 5 all right good make good schema migrations explore let's open up this one back up put-put come on there goes it's just taking a minute Oh that was really weird all right did a quick review of that net fiddle online let's get a link in there for that and this that there's need on that fiddle oh wow that's unfortunate I guess I don't get that link anymore whatever the last thing we're building with sonic damage so let's dig back into that and get let's write something around it put that in getting back into our sonic damage application and database all right so it looks like we got the database out there we created a DEP up and dep down something that I like to do just to give us an environment let's bounce out here and see where see what networks we got listed okay so let's doctor look to see what's running nothing okay so docker network remove trucks Annette but all right so now we can basically run in here we got stomach environment database schema migrations so we want to build out our database again make sure it's up and running so let's do dev up that should get us going there all right migratory see sharping I named it it's cracking me up all right and we should have oh we don't have that running so get Cassie container Oh conflict container name is already in use button oh okay so let's do docker move se paint now do dev oh okay so we ready got the network that's cool there now we got the now the container front yeah that's good okay run in three eight one one four and then let's see it where did we get with migrations oh yeah so clear that out and believe I have it running where yeah we're just calling the cql Sh straight which works for us in this situation but it really doesn't give us a true migration because it's not managing State or anything else about where we're what we're we're tracking right that go darker Network yeah okay all right next things next year what what do we want to build that's really the question what's the next thing that we should add at this point I think we did yeah I kind of talked about maybe just writing a data schema migrator for Apache Cassandra in c-sharp not sure if we want to do that but maybe maybe that is what we want to do yeah you know what let's actually work on that let's work on writing a data migration tool a data schema migration tool and data migration tool in c-sharp right that sounds like fun I think I think so let's work on that that's what we're gonna start working on and as first steps let's get let's uh let's actually take some notes here we can start from this I guess so here's our oh here's our program with our oh yeah that's right we wrote out and did the insert statement here so we have some data in here that we can run so let's actually run this just look at the data in the database real quick nice nice nice nice cool okay oh yeah we ended up with this weird looks I'll do that this weird text that's right some band whatever release the album I think we're doing like 1996 Oh 404 yeah and then it would parse it for us the c-sharp parses it for us and we get it in the right format to get inserted and read or not gonna write some data now hit enter ready Oh ready or not there we go okay so it should be in our artist let's just give me a give me a console just gonna console check the console let's read that yeah beautiful perfect okay there's our record as expected with the weird characters in there for whatever reason all right let's we know all this stuff in here work so this is great reference material to work from as we had built out in previous episodes let's take a look at our notes here deciding on [Music] really building out a migration looks C sharp migration app for patchy Cassandra schemer migrations now so let's see what would it call that a CSM CSM patchy cassandra scheme migrations mission build and applications using C sharp to do a key saundra slash DSC data schema migrations okay so basically a schema migration application would need to application just support it shorten it app will provide additive or actually let's do this app will take CG will files based on date time and up keyword or migrations up of data schema app will execute the cql files in order dated by date time app will then do the same let's actually do it up and up or down keyword all right an app will maintain state maintain state of up or down state a lets your a maintain a table of up or down state of the database key space alright so we're gonna use the key space from the perspective of like schema slash database itself we want to have the assumption that the key space has already created partly because with Apache Cassandra they to stack Center spray in enterprise once you create the key space the the catch is that has information and configuration based on your replication factor your CL other configuration options around the idea of how many nodes you're gonna use or need to use or not use so as that changes per se development environment or local dev environment like a docker container with one of patchy Cassandra node and then you roll it out to say dev or production which may have three or may have five or may have 50 or six thousand or however many nodes you'll want to be able to not roll-up over that so the same thing with the premise of doing schema migrations with a a relational database where you don't really roll the database itself you're just doing the schema tables referential integrity things like that so it Apache Cassandra we need to look at the key space as that particular piece of the architecture so we'll assume that the key space is built but I'm going to add a feature or two around that I think we should add a feature to run that so let's actually write that out and determine how we'll do that so app will provide a way to create the initial key space based on various requirements figuration such as strat strategy with location factor etc I don't need to know all the things just yet but we'll get that figured out app will store connection information for pertinent pertinent to the database that it is is or needs to be working against and then app will add the ability to have the connection information passed in if this works more effectively or automation ok app will initially provide a pencil based CLI style interaction model then app we will intend to build out some multi interface options for this application once the CLI is built out and operative yeah yeah I think that's cool idea so let's build this let's build this application that's gonna be step one of doing this now on the c-sharp our I will still be doing a number of other things introducing new features from the driver for Apache Cassandra and data stacks Enterprise but we're also going to work on this application to really get more familiar with what we're trying to do when we're working with Apache Cassandra what we're trying to do with the drivers how to use the drivers and all that kind of jazz so with that I don't know should add schema migration explorations so this is this is gonna be our like test account but let's get another one set up new we're gonna we're definitely gonna go the dotnet core route so we need will probably do its your unit test class library console application it's been on a core web application oh did it let's actually let's start with an empty solution here we go and we'll call this a CSM AP or I will call it casi schema migrator CSM yeah there we go I will create a git repo Oh your career lhg that's cool create directory for solution and here yes please so okay we're gonna create that nyan cats gonna get run in there for us we'll do it in this window oh I wonder if we'll just use the driver so I don't really need CQ s CQ LS sequel CQ l shell we won't need CQ l shell installed on a machine this year let's put that in the notes to put that right here app will not require any a chi chi cassandra related CLI tools drivers or other elements on the machine that it executes from okay i think that's that's a good feature requirement all right so let's bounce back over here cassie ski cassie schema migrator and now let's add our first project bits here so new project i'm going to do a unit test project we'll call it Cassie or the tests as such actually should I create the oops hey let's use X unit Hatton used X unit in a million years I'm gonna be completely unfamiliar but it'll be a good thing for us to go through so Cassie core Lib tests alright I guess it's doing it yeah there we go um yes please create ignore fall what do we even put in here now the visual studio or is it like oh yeah there's visual studio probably all we need right is this having a direct refuse trash that's that stuff okay that's that's good enough start whatever so generate me this file no don't do that just yet think so now the other question is where where did it put it okay I'll see it show all files oh my goodness there we go that is beautiful that's what I wanted to see so we definitely wanted that and then since we're in JetBrains writers let's let's use let's actually light this up a little bit to just for good measure do something a little different um let's use VCS on this team City we're gonna do VCS get and then let's look at our commit commit file I don't know commit file I wanna do actually yeah let's let's take a look at our record here okay so that's pretty much everything that I want yeah let's add adding dot git ignore fall that looks good let's use our cleanup options yeah cool alright so I'm going to commit that 4x unit 2.4 X unit Visual Studio 2.40 done it SDK that all looks good so then I think ctrl K is it get commit directory let's look at the rest of our stuff so solution test let's get that fixed up a little bit no need to do it just yet so that test oh cool okay we got a little skeleton but we want to get in there and add our next project which will be class library yep that looks good too to see sharp and we'll call this Cassie for lib okay last one you test one and then we're gonna have our actual console application Cassy console there we go now let's also do project one of the options okay here we got an application cross-platform Android iOS Mac OS TV OS watch Alice can I even run that on here template author JetBrains what else we got we got Android iOS I don't even know if I can build the iOS on here we don't we don't really want to do it mobile anyway right now currently um what's your unit test project was this Oh a bunch of yeah that stuff library is and I want to do that unity class library unity installation is not found I wonder if I can build a UI for this in unity and just make it look crazy amazing or if this is like stupidly proprietary yeah fit it with that later so there is a web application asp.net web application this perspective but I could do that from here use dotnet core in my opinion a much better option so here's react with feed ducks web back with model-view-controller web api razor class library empty so I wonder about what is the new thing blazer blaze or maybe we'll get back and look at that later or install it simply it's just gonna give me a nice no I here we go let's browse the online templates and posit or ease just to see what our other options are if it comes up ah there we go hmm that's cool but yet we know that and while we were here in github land okay so let's your dot netbox idea this lambda cake frosting oh that's cool bbm framework Ito forms I don't know what that is base code generator gtk sharp oh is that for Linux maybe we'll take a look at that Kinnick oh i'll boilerplate mono game see scaffolding this event sourcing uh interesting look at that [Music] particular templates ah I see what that is so that's that stuff PowerShell core prism for prism for xamarin forms cars net CLI - oh geez okay service stack hmm okay so then we had some F sharp stuff fable library now this is the C sharp our but still just looking at all this stuff here this framework can be used to build applications that run across multiple platforms using their native toolkit with an easy-to-use API to make your application look and work as a native application on all platforms using a single UI code base framework currently supports creating desktop applications at work Crossman is formed IPF mono Mac and gtk+ there's a mobile some-something whatever framework was built so that using it in dotnet is natural for example a simpler world might look like this or f-sharp hey hey that's cool maybe I do f-sharp our QuickStart guide let's look at the docks because this might be the instant winner here Visual Studio a marketplace we're not using that we're using not this stuff so dotnet new so how do I add okay now just to run the following command line saml you get your store okay so that's Ito this is itõs still assemblies and they apparently supported targets so I found this via going this way so that's that thing you're just looking at so how do I pull it into JetBrains writer as a template that's my question oh and then as your pack lines succeeded cross-platform GUI framework for desktop and mobile applications and dotnet right then here install a template cancel let's look at making a new template for done nd creating installing your own templates da da da [Music] all right well like I was saying we need to get the console going first so we'll come back to ito let's make a note about that though and also Mack job Windows job that's cool oh yeah I need to sign into DevOps and we'll take a look at that in just a minute so we got everything console pour liqueur lib test so we are off to a start with that and let's set this as [Music] it's a configuration Cassy consoles the main thing shows page after launch no I don't want to launch that stuff what is this for I don't even I don't understand what that's for at all this is a console app you doesn't need these environment variables from what I know let's hit apply and see where we give with this so dude debug everything should just build okay and execute the console boom alright and then here we should be able to run yeah run unit tests and get a little output here yeah perfect okay so there's our unit test and then of course this will build by inference let's do a reference to you core Lib like so there we go yeah what should be in there all right we're gonna go and actually change back theme because my my eyeballs are gonna pop out of my head oh wow iOS right there nice okay - oh there's a material theme theme chooser let's go to get a deep ocean theme yeah there we go that's a little better all right so we got this peripheral let's call this environmental tasks so we need to set up the build set up a build or our application determine and outputs for Mac OS Linux and Windows setup documentation or our application I think we might just use the wiki page you know I think we should go to some crazy extent I mean it's gonna be a pretty straightforward application just from the items in the list there so so it shouldn't be yeah we know we don't need a setup like a crazy documentation generation fabrication thing but as I like to do I kind of try to go documentation first and then get into next steps about things that way have I better explain to myself what I'm actually trying to build so with that next steps we should go ahead and dive in and see where we can get with some of these environmental tasks oh do we need a big question here I don't know I'll need docker stuff to build but maybe I should use some docker containers to build the various pieces I don't know if that's really necessary I don't know actually the contain mm-hmm I don't think we'll need it for the environmental aspect of it for the build we'll keep the build just straight console DLLs or whatever and then work from there but I'll still need local doctor doctor container or a key Cassandra to work from a work yeah there we go okay especially for the creation of key space etcetera etcetera and just to work through the demos but I also want to make sure that the unit tests aren't dependent on the database because we're just trying to test core first principle functionality on the class that I write so we're going to try to keep that and try to keep that focus to that alright this this looks good so let's get this first let's get out on github here and let's actually go out to rip tano oh I got a scroll to it sometimes I'm in too many code organizations all right in here Jenga sippy feet is it your ever there's our trucks y'all shouldn't see most of those ha ha actually I'm just gonna dab this so I'm building it I'm just gonna put it online for now I'll go new what did I call it I called it forgot what I called it write it up here let's do this though I need it for 4h for or functionality that's under schema migration then enough calling it that though where's my project Cassie schema migrator yeah with CSM Cassie schema migrator running Apache Cassandra and data stacks Enterprise see schema migrations fancy migrator what is this now it confirms that that seems weird all right so let's go to actually we need VCS get I do push well let me add the what this weird define remote ah here we go sweet adding beginning or fall does it know to do a dash you to map the saying that is my question alright yeah okay there we go what's ahead of read me my grater will do pool I think will ya there we go so then I got to do this I guess yeah that shows just the readme very nice now let's take our notes wash there you go from here dad mom take those and we're gonna put them in I read the file and that of course change as we make progress so then let's add our unit test file program s for the console or the I'm doing control a to get all these in there and let's your control sit control K that directory adding first projects and defaults skillet turning on the files there we go commit and push gracious what is it there we go progress but I have no idea why this is taking so long that's really weird I would have thought it would have been really just snappy quick Oh more cleanup code okay Wow denying cat stuck now no doesn't look stuck Oh well as we get this posted I am out of coffee I am also out of refreshing drink so it looks like it's almost time to wrap up but how are we with this push that's still work oh here we go push commits okay origin to master that's what we want to do I have all our bits in here so I'll go and do push we have not broken any warnings or thrown thrown any warnings or errors so that's good I would assume to not have these at this early of a stage in the game all right so that looks like it went let's refresh and just check and all right so now the other thing that I want to do maybe we'll just add wiki stuff for the project as the documentation I think that's what I'll do so I'm gonna go into settings though and I'm gonna actually take out a few social preview what is that that's new all right we're gonna take out project projects or art now let's leave that in there but I do want to or do I want to leave it in there projects wiki incites issues you know let's leave we'll leave all that stuff in there actually I was gonna take out well I was thinking about taking out issues but I don't wanna do that because we want to work on this thing all right so everything's just gonna stay as it is I got to figure out this template thing download template whoa let's let's look at it let's see what we got here images should be at least six forty by three 20px pixels or 1280 by 640 open it up again already upload an image to customize your repositories social media preview repo card template we recommend leaving a 40-point border around the important details of your social card to make sure nothing gets cropped okay so then do I just delete this no no what got a selected right there we go delete yeah now we got a transparent pipe piece oh let's get some black text here and uh well actually uh where is the fill there it is so let's make that white and then put that in I'm gonna do that and then we'll get text on let's see what do we want let's pick some text real quick not that cuz it's not gonna do me any good Manos face let's put that in get the right color here for it to stand out and then we will start right here and go with what is it so we're calling it Cassie whoo okay maybe not that big 64 yeah there we go Cassie schema migrate or no well that's smaller considering it didn't fit there we go string it out a little bit more and then oh yeah I like this then we're going to Center it no we're going to justify this way there we go that should be centered okay cool and then I still want to do a fill let's do it this way and get a different color in here let's go with Oh what color should we go with here well for right now I'm gonna pick a crazy green color area let's do this so I need a new level new layer transparency yes please all right now let's try that again no I need to flatten it all let's try that there we go okay let's not use come on give me the green yeah err alright so I'm just deleting these edges to give us that pixel count that it requested like so and then let's do it export as and the request was actually was it PNG jpg I guess what did we what did we get it in save it just pictures let's put it in and Cassie schemer migrator actually this should go in the repo let's do that dowlas no dude Adrienne codes Cassie schema migrator let's create folder I'll call it logo or image collateral I don't call it it's that's what it's gonna be for now so we're gonna save the xcf we better slower compression it's fine and let's do export as well first let's check the image size to make sure we what they gave us yeah okay we're gonna do export as PNG and then we'll do export as jpg oops all right so then let's get this yes edit upload image codes Adrian oh there we go codes okay see schema my greater image glad role and with the PNG it's smaller there we go nice so did I just save this it's it's saved I guess it's saved so now where do I see that that is the question but whatever we figured that out in a minute all right so we've got a readme done we got our initial code projects put together we're basically ready to start I'm gonna add these elements as issues and then basically as issue stories for us to work on but before that one other last little thing addition here we're gonna do see where is it what did they do with it oh yeah set up templates that's what I want to do so add a bug report and then we're gonna have a feature request and then let's do custom template preview an edit will say issue custom issue template let's call it say that's a feature request this is going to be a mmm story a feature feature story you know I'm just I'm just gonna go with feature request feature requests gonna be good enough so proposes changes update issues templates commit and then let's see about syncing that up real quick I'm gonna actually do it via the CLI because I don't know well actually let's see let's see how this handles it so we got this stuff now and I want to do a git commit directory and yeah okay so it does give me the option so I'm going to add all these adding collateral logo social media images or projects on github that I'm gonna just commit that like so so everything should be good there and then I'm gonna do get whole repository yeah pool alright there's our bug reports and stuff there's our clot image collateral our issue templates so that looks good [Music] yeah cool and then just for good measure get commit directory no changes all right cool so we are all good to go I believe or no there is changes because yeah we're ahead by two commits so let's let's push that up there git push origin master there we go so the writer did not it should have let me do a push but I guess I would have had to go okay this then get and then push over here so ctrl shift K and yeah I would have let me do it then with the with those pertinent changes but anyway when I shut this down for now we are wrapping up again just to review if you go out to github for one go and star this project like so fork it if you want to work on it we went over the core functionality I'll be adding the issues so people can work on those if they want to I would love contributions we're following a pretty basic schema migration tool build out here just building it specifically for Apache Cassandra using c-sharp so if anybody wants to jump in very very happy to take pull request and we'll get this thing working in the next couple of weeks working on it via the c-sharp our with everybody and the last thing here I'm showing you data stacks kami events just to review one last time we have coming up let's here on the 26 killer application dealer video application development that'll be Python with Jeff and David then we have the next c-sharp our will be on May 2nd so it's gonna be a little different time at 1 p.m. instead of 10 a PDT then we're aiming to try to get the building to geo app trucks on DSC its episode five then another killer video application development here with Jeff David and then Christina and I will definitely be diving in on May 7th for the trucks application build a continuing and then some more c-sharp hours go out check out our events page and we will be updating it with additional shows as we get those on the schedule so we've got lots of good stuff coming for you again thanks for watching live thanks for watching post live whatever the case hope you enjoyed the C sharp hour and I will see you next time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you",
