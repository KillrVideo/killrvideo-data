    "text": "[Music] now that you've had an overview of dc graph we're going to take a look at managing property graphs we'll do this using two main sections of content the first explains property graph data models and the second explains operations on the graph property data model itself let's start with an overview of the graph property data model mathematically we can define a property graph as a directed binary attributed multi-graph it consists of a set of vertices a multi-set of directed binary edges and key value pairs of properties associated with vertices and edges for those that don't come from a mathematical background property graph data models represent graphs using three elements vertices things edges relationships and properties attributes on either vertices or edges each vertex in a property graph has a unique id that is specified by a graph creator the name of the id type for dsc graph is a user-defined vertex id each vertex also has a label that generally denotes a type of an entity that a vertex represents in this illustration we have seven vertices with labels movie person user and genre all of these vertices have unique ids such as m267 or p4361 it is convenient for us to think of ids as simple strings in this example but in reality vertex ids and dsc graph are frequently composed of multiple components used not only for uniqueness but also for graph partitioning talk more in a subsequent section of this course about how to use ids to achieve data locality in dse graph each binary edge connects exactly two vertices edges are always directed have automatically assigned unique identifiers and have labels since a property graph is a multi-graph it is possible to have multiple edges connecting the same two vertices such parallel edges may have the same direction and labels but will have different ids in this illustration we connected our vertices with labeled edges edges and their labels usually denote relationships between entities represented by vertices it's getting more interesting we can now read that some user u185 rated movie m267 that has some actor p4361 though edges are created with direction dsc graph automatically stores both directions in and out of an edge to ensure users have the flexibility of traversing an edge in any direction with the same performance properties are key value pairs that can be associated with any vertex or edge in a property graph they describe individual vertices the entities and edges those relationships our sample graph now contains a lot of useful information take a look we can see properties on both the vertices and edges a vertex property that can have multiple values is called a multi-property in this example we have production and budget as multi-properties and show their values in square brackets another way to think about them is having multiple key value pairs with the same key for example budget budget can have 150 million dollars and 200 million dollars note that multiple properties are only applicable to vertices and not to edges a property that can be assigned to a vertex property is called a meta property meta properties are usually used for describing access control providence and audit information for individual vertex properties in this example we have meta properties describing provenance of two movie budget estimates as well as meta properties describing access control for permissions for the person properties note that meta properties are only applicable to vertex properties and not to edge properties a meta property cannot be a multi-property or have meta properties assigned to it here we see all these concepts combined to create a robust data model that represents a real world graph we can see persons and movies and how they relate whether actors or other actors we can see users rating movies we can see movies belonging to genres we can also see a lot of great information about the movies whether we're talking about the budget multi-properties or the budget meta properties from bloomberg businessweek or the los angeles times graph databases are based on graph mathematics though not required it is helpful to know the meaning of a few graph theory terms so let's take a look and we'll use the example on the slide to explain some of these terms first let's start with incident edge an edge is called incident to a vertex when the vertex is one of the edge's endpoints for example actor is incident to movie m267 or rated as well as another incident edge incoming and outgoing edges an edge is directed either in or out of a vertex so for movie m267 we see an outgoing edge actor to p4361 we see an incoming edge rated from the user vertex in this example vertex degrees represent the number of incident edges belonging to a vertex we could have in degree or out degree and the actual vertex degree represents the sum of in degrees and out degrees so for this example the vertex movie m267 has a vertex degree of four with three outgoing degrees and one incoming degree adjacent vertex a vertex a is called adjacent to a vertex v when there exists an edge between the two vertices for instance we see that movie m267 is adjacent to person p4361 path path is a sequence of alternating vertices and edges beginning and ending with vertices where each edge's endpoints are the preceding and following vertices in the sequence here we see a path from user through rated to movie m267 and out through the actor edge to person p4361 there are special types of paths in graph theory there's a simple path which is a path that cannot repeat an edge or vertex there's also cyclic paths a cyclic path is a path with repetition and therefore cycles there's also the shortest length path this represents a path with the least number of edges to get from one vertex point to the other finally sub graphs a sub graph s of a graph g is a graph whose vertices are a subset of the vertex set of g and whose edges are a subset of the edge set of g so here we have a sub graph of movie and person out of our full graph to summarize this illustration shows a sub-graph of the original graph we saw previously with five vertices and four edges vertex m267 has four incident edges one incoming and three outgoing and four adjacent vertices only simple paths exist in this subgraph this is only to get us started there will be plenty of new notions introduced gradually throughout this course",
