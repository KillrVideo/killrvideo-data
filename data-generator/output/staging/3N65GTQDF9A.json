  "description": "In this episode Adron Hall speaks with Luc Perkins about his work at the CNCF, Kubernetes, and where projects are heading and what projects they're working on. Adron also speaks with Luc about docs, projects he's been seeing that are really interesting, skeleton code for projects, and lot's of other topics.\n\nHighlights\n0:14 Introducing Luc Perkins.\n0:58 Talking CNCF, Kubernetes, Containers, and the cloud native paradigm.\n1:27 Introduction to the presentation at hand with Prometheus and it's status as a graduated project within the CNCF.\n1:50 What has Luc been working on that he's found interesting.\n2:16 Developer Advocate, a somewhat nebulas title. Presentations, documentation, conference organizing, graphic design, and sometimes - yes, indeed - contributing code!\n3:03 Learn what is the most sought after demand from open source teams for help!\n3:50 Skaffolding and related interesting technology discussion and why you might want to check it out too.\n5:48 Adron describeds why we need to get back to writing code and stop fiddling with Kubernetes. Then discusses with Luc how Brendan Burns, Kelsey Hightower, and others in the community have said the same and are pushing for solutions.\n6:38 Luc weighs in on where and why the developer story is still somewhat lacking, and why.\n7:10 More details on Skaffold, the yaml, and the respective service.\n9:38 Which of the container technologies does Luc use these days.\n10:28 One CNCF project that's interesting, Luc talks about - in the sandbox - is Harbor, a kind of Docker hub.\n12:10 What will happen the next couple of years? How can we develop more reliably with questionable connections, disparate and problematic dependency repositories, and the like? For example, what about that NPM issue as of late? Luc and Adron discuss.\n13:40 What is the direction the CNCF has been moving to simplify and enhance the local development story?\n15:32 Luc describes a secret about the meetup, and more on Kubernetes developer story.\n17:55 Stepping int",

    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems hello I'm Adrienne probably know me by now this is Luke our guest today he is in the process of giving a talk tonight but we caught him right before to talk about some things related largely to what you're doing these days which is which is I am currently a developer advocate at the CN CF the the cloud native computing foundation in case you're not familiar with it it is a it's an open source foundation a non-profit or open source foundation with funding from a lot of big and small tech companies out there and and they work on a project that's kind of popular called they work on a couple projects we you maybe you're probably pointing me in the direction of kubernetes which is which I think we could call our flagship project but yeah yeah it's it's essentially an open source foundation like the Apache foundation but with with a heavy focus in in containers and what we're calling the the cloud native paradigm cool very cool and tonight you're actually gonna be talking specifically about Prometheus which is besides kubernetes the other graduated project right yeah so so right now we have a number of projects that are applying for graduation from the CN CF but but Prometheus is that is the second to graduate after communities I believe it was in August that that for me has kind of got over the hump so just a short period of time really yeah yeah that's cool so with that what what have you been working on lately that's really kind of intrigued you that you found interesting that you've really wanted to get into more that you've been working with well Adrian or yes like or or as I call them the large Adrian Collider oh dear I've called him this for years we go we go way back to the Portland tech scene anyways so it's Adrienne you know as well as anybody that that a position like developer advocate is a very kind of nebulous where you end up doing all cloudy even yeah it's it's quite quite cloudy cloudy and you end up doing any number of things you end up you know putting meetups together you end up giving presentations you end up writing blog posts and tweeting and pounding the pavement and or having every bids we contributing code or heaven forbid contributing code a lot of that which I don't do a lot of that so in my case as a developer advocate for the CNC F because it's an open-source foundation I'm simply I'm there to serve the projects right so so whatever the project maintainer is need from us as an organization we we try to give so and that can mean a lot of things as an organization we you know we plan conferences we plan meetups we we provide graphic design work we we do all kinds of things thus far I've been trying to fill a gap that that actually most projects identify as the most as their biggest pain point and their biggest need well is yeah Doc's yeah yeah so so tonight for example I'm here in town up in Seattle to do a meet-up presentation and I plan on doing plenty of that but actually turns out that in our internal survey that we do every year amongst our you know 15 or 15 to 20 odd projects documentation of website health is is identified as V number one I can see a thing I think that's even the same in like Apache and yeah a lot of them whatever the node one is in and all that it's always always Doc's there's always Doc's to be written right exactly yeah so that's far you know I'm sure that my role will will change a lot over time as we as we get more help in the CNC F and as the as the projects potentially change ownership blah blah blah a lot can happen but yeah so in my in my four months of the CNC fs4 it's been a lot of Doc's been working on kubernetes Docs Prometheus Docs container D Jagr tracing all kinds of stuff you name it yeah interesting so it's kind of a random question here what is what container tech are using mostly right now taken by using mostly right now oh that's a good question I you know when you you know as a person who's mostly just been writing Docs and and working on website but I know you're building stuff ya know I'm always I'm always playing around this stuff behind the scenes I would say you know there's a few things that I that I am finding pretty interesting in the both within the the CN CF umbrella and and outside of it I would say that probably the most interesting thing to me right now is is outside of the CN CF umbrella so really so some people at Google are working on a tool called scaffold that's scaffold with a K okay and and this is a really interesting tool that you know I've complained a lot in the past that that as much as I love kubernetes and find it get really compelling as an operational story and as a platform that the developers story is still very lacking that yeah that's a tough one that you just the kubernetes is great if you have an entire team of people who are who are making it great for you and turning it into a pass kind of a running theme at the last good con yeah was a lot of people were driving home the point that we need to get to the point with kubernetes where the developers aren't writing could cuddle or cube see tail or whatever you could control whatever your variance is that you type we don't need the developers to have to fiddle with that that needs to be done and the developers need to have their packaged application or business deployment and ready to just ship out the door and be able to do that and they don't need to be messing with all that other stuff and that was like every everybody from Brendan burns - Kelsey Hightower they were all talking about that so I can imagine that hopefully the developer story is getting more streamlined and we'll get more smoothed out over the next year or so or two or three yeah I I mean I certainly hope so too I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say this is a CNC f person but it continues to surprise me given given the the human power and the resources behind projects like kubernetes that the developer story is still so so lacking and you know I'm not so sure that I mean who knows is scaffold gonna step in and be the thing that everybody uses I mean who knows it's hard to predict but but I do think that it's it's filling that gap really well you know I would describe it as it's something like docker compose but for kubernetes with all kinds of crazy auto refresh capabilities built in so so basically with with scaffold you can have all your kubernetes Yam all definitions and you can actually watch them for changes so see making a mole change and it'll update kubernetes but is it like a service that runs to watch this stuff yeah no it's just it's a service that runs it's it's it's designed at least in dev mode to just be to just run locally on your laptop in Canoga oh yeah so but even better though is that it can actually interact with things like like docker files basil builds and a bunch of other stuff so basically so you can say this container is named this and if you make changes to the underlying source code it will rebuild your container redeploy it on kubernetes that's and it does it all locally there are so a couple pain points for me I think it's still really unwieldy to deal with with things like config Maps so there's nothing like like in docker compose when you just say yeah this this local config file just mounted as a volume in this container and it all just works alright and so you can just think of of an entire repo as one one big docker compose project which I which I absolutely love yeah so there's nothing like that just yet you still have to handle your config Maps and your config files is kind of a separate thing but I have my fingers majorly crossed that the scaffold folks are gonna both on that that sounds like one of my favorite things that I use and used to use a lot where in my IDE I would get it set up where if I save a file it immediately runs test again mm-hmm like it rebuilds whatever it is it checks the binary it does all this stuff and I don't have to do anything all I'm doing is I write the code SAVE maybe write a test then save that and it's it's always in a state of bill green or if I've saved a bad file and I've broken something and it goes red and I get to trace into that immediately right instead of fiddle around about it and that sounds really cool from the infrastructure perspective because heaven forbid you break something there that takes hours to rebuild half the time or something so that's that's pretty awesome now you get me excited about it yeah yeah I I do I do highly recommend it very cool so on on on these avenues of development that this unit CN CF is working on is is there any particular and I'm trying to try to drill in and figure out what which of the container text do you are you most familiar with that you like to work with besides a docker I mean docker is obviously can sure that sure well yeah with with kubernetes I'm getting there of course I've been working a lot on the documentation and a lot on the website and things like that but in terms of stuff that I under the CN CF umbrella that I'm really interested in well or that I use in a regular basis I mean just like the other projects you don't really care about the underlying container tech okay cuz I mean that's the that's the thing of kubernetes right it's not supposed to matter right it's not supposed to matter yeah yeah that's a great question I mean yeah besides scaffold actually one-one ciencia project that I that is currently incubating that I'm excited about or actually or is is it sunny incubating it's it's in the sandbox aha which is a step prior to incubation there's a project called called harbor which is a container registry an open source container registry so which would enable you to essentially have your own run your own docker hub locally for usage you can you know potentially in conjunction with kubernetes or or you can just you know pull docker images down directly or so on and so forth I think that that's pretty interesting and compelling you know definitely takes a very important piece of the of the the whole container II picture and brings it down to earth into open source land which i think is great oh yeah I always seem like I would trip in the process of trying to do stuff with containers early on was trying to figure out where to put them yeah because like he the minute you step in an enterprise you say alright we're gonna use a container stuffing they're like cool what you're getting them off of a public repo no and and everything falls apart because you you have to have some type of internal repo system server service whatever to put those things in or it's a no-go for a lot of enterprises so that's that's pretty cool - yeah I can see how a lot of a lot of sree sysadmin ops security type people would be very skittish about or have been have traditionally been very skittish about about having docker hub right as a as a as a dependency you know you know pulling images over the open Internet yeah a lot of issues it's the same with the libraries it seems like I almost would bet I'm not going to but I almost would bet that over the next couple years I feel like a resurgence of what can I bring to a local environment and do locally and not have to connect to to do development and to have my environment built because there's been a lot of these major major outages whether it's libraries and like NPM or go dependencies that do some crazy security mishap or whatever or even just well we started to deploy a version of whatever - our distributed system and then the thing we were pulling it from isn't available anymore so we just upgraded half our system in half is not upgraded so now we're in this weird pseudo broken state and it's like you you need to bring almost like it was done years ago but you need to bring a copy of that software and then work from that locally 100% locally either to the local network or to the local machine and do everything from there I feel like there's a little bit of a resurgence around some of that stuff and even with Google it was the local coupe thing now Oh mini cube or is it still just calm anymore or mini cube and I suppose mini cube mini kind of us yeah mini KUB yeah so like I'm wondering about that in this space like what is going to be done there to help build things locally because even with functions of the service or lambda stuff you still have to like run and test some of them have you seen anything or any impetus to move in that way as far as development is concerned with CN CF and kubernetes and all that stuff yeah that's a good question yeah the I think that the the local development story is still very much a kind of a wild west where where there's a broad assortment of tools that are that are you know filling in some of the gaps I think that I think you know scaffold is the most noteworthy that I've personally seen thus far but I think that I mean I suppose this is probably kind of an overgeneralization but within the kubernetes ecosystem in general I think that a lot of the effort really has been targeted more at the you know larger team kind of level where something like you know container registries and you know CI CD platforms that target kubernetes and a lot of that stuff I think that the picture is is slowly emerging there and I think that some really solid gains have been have been won in the last in the last year or two it's easy to forget that kubernetes is like for you well it's actually yeah just Isla is you know a toddler amongst open source projects I was thinking that just so you said said well just in the last one or two years the huge gains that have been made and I'm my first thought is like wait since it was that's about how old yeah yeah that's about when I heard of it 2016 or so yeah but I think that that you know on the the side of the lone wolf developers story you know how far can you get on a laptop how dangerous can you be with kubernetes on the laptop it I think it's still pretty limited I think there's a lot of way a long ways to go there I and I actually I I came upon this problem when I was trying to put together a demo for the for the meet up tonight for doing a demo on on Cassandra and and Prometheus which doing the demo guys yeah and and I just I'm gonna come out and admit it I just I couldn't get it to work on kubernetes no I couldn't do it and and you know I write docs for kubernetes I've used it for a bunch of things I've used to locally I've used it and you know Google cloud platform I've missed I have missed around with it a little bit on AWS you know I can do meaningful things with kubernetes but but when it came to basically running a a Cassandra cluster properly configuring it yeah and it in also and also running and running JMX exporters for Prometheus like in basically in the same pod yeah as the as the Cassandra nodes and then also running and configuring Prometheus running and configuring alert manager running and configuring gravano dashboards to run in kubernetes I just it turned into such a horrific pile of spaghetti that I basically said I I basically said I need to do something less ambitious and less less demanding you did just become an entire IT department yourself yeah pretty much yeah pretty much and and I mean perhaps perhaps one of the problems with kubernetes is that it's so powerful that it that it it up more yeah it induces you to think that you're capable of more than you actually are but yeah and and that really hammered home for me that Wow it still is really difficult to to work with these things and and especially like I mentioned earlier with scaffold like things like configuration files which you know when you're used to running things locally you just you know you have your configuration file on your on you know on disk somewhere and you you point to with a command line flag and it just works and then in a kubernetes environment a lot of this stuff really just breaks down yeah a lot of these a lot of these guarantees and a lot of this scaffolding no pun intended that we're used to in local environments just doesn't apply a lot of it is kind of court scaffolding versus solid stuff still so I mean you have very big variances and even with like you were working with Cassandra is not something that you just whimsically deploy out to kubernetes it is unto itself a complex system so your time a complex distributed system running the complex distributed system right so you know there's a lot of possible conflicts there and then like you know if you don't have the storage mapped right and something ephemeral goes away yes cassandra flips out trying to fix it and kubernetes starts to try to fix it and it's just it's downhill from there yeah and our Bertels yeah absolutely and and and that really hammered home to me that when it comes to these complex distributed systems like like Cassandra but you could name many others oh yeah running you know zookeeper coffee pulsar you know you name it that that the story there is still pretty rough in it you know honestly one of the like one of the hubristic aspects of the the live demo is gonna do is that is that I I thought to myself oh I shouldn't you know I don't need to use an operator I'm just gonna I'm just gonna write my own yeah mole just which I'm gonna write my own demo configs and of course that became an absolute mess which which underscored to me that that that I mean basically operators are quickly emerging as a very very necessary thing yes and that doing things any other way is is is pretty not so still I think I'm with you on that one but even there I even there I mean operators are a nice thing but they're also not easy and they're not in and there's all and there still isn't a great story like okay I'm running mini cube on my on my laptop and now I want to get this Cassandra operator running and spin up a little cluster and so on and so forth like there's still a lot of you know you're clicking around through Doc's and installing this and installing yes and and I think that those are very necessary and unavoidable growing pains but yeah I'm I'm of course very excited to see where things go I you know we have coop con Seattle coming up in December yeah December 10 or 9 I think so yeah yeah up here up here in lovely Seattle in the Emerald City we hope you're coming because it's gonna be a huge group of awesome people working on a lot of awesome projects yeah it's gonna be great I'm actually going to to coop Khan in Shanghai next month as well and so and and of course I'm gonna go into these events with with one thing in mind and and basically in every presentation and in every every conversation I have I mean everybody comes to a conference like that with their own kind of agenda my agenda is it is 100 percent developer usability yes that's absolutely and obviously I'm a developer advocate so but it's not just my job title that leads me to to have this concern I have this concern because I think that you know I have a I just I have a developer centric worldview when they come tourism close to the entire tech sector so when I'm rooting for the team and for you and all that - and I'll be there adding my input as I do sometimes in my various opinions and I'm really looking forward to it I'm shocked I'm shocked that you'll be that you'll be happier vitamins opinions yeah I have this sometimes they just come forth and on that note thanks for talking to us thanks for having me Adrian I'm the Hadrian Collider large Adrienne Collider I'm Luke Perkins thank you for having me and this has been the distributed data
