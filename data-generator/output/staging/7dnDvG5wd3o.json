    "text": "[Music] and welcome to another episode of data stacks is Apache Cassandra and DSCC sharp our we're getting right into it today no specific announcements no specific pre mentions of anything we're just gonna get into it in the last session I got into some docker coding or coding a round docker I guess not really docker coding but using docker with c-sharp and in that I did some kind of some coding acrobatics it was a little nuts so the first thing we want to do today is I'm gonna review see let's see well how did this review the docker code and refactor from last session we're gonna do that and then we're gonna get into the what do we even call it I'm not sure let's see what so we'll look at the refactor we're gonna try not to crash the machine this time because last time docker brought down the machine I was just working with docker a little bit earlier and it actually brought down virtual machines that had running and other things like that so it's docker can be a little tricky sometimes it doesn't particularly run without contaminating your memory and compute and space so you gotta be a little careful sometimes I know everybody puts everything on it these days but you have to think about what you're doing with that so anyway we're gonna dig into that a little bit talk a little bit more about what specifically is going on with it and then bringing it back into the integration test with the core code base around schema migrations and then our kind of reach goal is we're gonna make make some cql migration run make a cql migration run let's see what is it for bold yeah I think that'll do it and then let's save this for today markdown anyway let's dive into writer and get this happening let's crank that music down just a little bit there we go that's in the background let's get rollin the other thing that is always useful let's get the code full front and center yeah alright so last week I had this examples library which is just now now it's just this it runs the Cassandra container it then writes the docker address which is an important thing I need the address the IP of it to actually do particular tests and things like that with it so that we can connect to it and do things like write data or read data or whatever we need to do and then after that I stopped Cassandra and then I remove the Cassandra container instance from the list right so the container that is created from the Cassandra image is removed at the end of this so when we get to this point nothing should be left now over here in a docker for tests is what I named the library and I just named the object that we use docker cruft because really what this is is I'm trying to get it so that I can spin up an instance easily in a programmatic way know where that instance is but and connect to it insert delete remove do whatever I need to do with the migrations on a live container on a live Cassandra node and then basically shut it all down so I know that I'm using the cleanest minimalist thing installed possible every time I run these tests so that's that's what I want to do as a wrap-up functionalities be able to run an actual migration some cql against the Cassandra node that we're starting up with this code right here so if you take a look at this right do up at the top I have a constructor of the class this constructor takes and Nate has the name the network and the version that we're using set up by default I've kind of done this so that I can make this class a little bit more generic in the future so that I can use it in besides this one unique use case but anyway for this though I just use a gooood or UUID and stick it into the middle of the name so that the name is always unique when this instance is created and I can trace it back to a particular execution of the tests then it I'd stick it into the default Network I don't need to do any fancy anything around networking I set the image specifically to Cassandra 3.11 for as you see and then with that with that done I then can instantiate it other ways to because I have this constructor than an overloaded constructor with container name network and Cassi version so right now this is the only one I'm using but if I default it I'll use this one all right so with that done those variables available to us to use throughout this I have execute docker which takes a docker command and runs it here is the process that starts it okay then I at thread sleep for two seconds write processing then I thread sleep again and then write the finish statement now reason I do that is because sometimes docker isn't instantaneous if I'm removing or building a container in a particular way I need to wait a few seconds before I try to issue that next command so right now just as a stopgap I put in two second delays with the red dot sleep then we get down to the specific commands here's run kasi so this runs the actual container you can see it puts in the version Network and the name of the container and so on stop the container remove the container and then this gets the docker address which is what we built specifically last time some of that other code was done in the example but then I refactored it and pulled it out and put it into this particular project so I could have a standalone class and thus object to use in the other projects above so let's cross all our fingers here okay got all my fingers crossed and run this and see if this runs so it's just running the docker example which is this project which is this code file and this code specifically okay here's our main that's what we're gonna run so let's run that I ran it with debug so it started to build the bill that's succeeded and there goes so it ran the container you can see it gave it its ID there external sources something happen generating debug info yeah something blew up big time so let's get in here though go back where did we get to we got running container unknown flag format self a self-sufficient runtime for containers so it looks like it tried to run another docker command and it didn't have the right details so before I even look at that error let's step through this and see what we get here so I'm betting it's running and breaking on or is it here it's a finish statement statement so running this then this cassie and then this so I'm betting it's breaking somewhere in here so let's step through this alright so I'm gonna stop execution but let's go see what was left over it's not dr. PS alright so that instance it did start the container we have confirmation of it right there here's our crazy name with a good in it okay so I'm gonna actually stop that docker stop kasi Leopard block for testing and take a look at where it's saved there oh there it is right here and then we'll actually remove that kasi there we go alright so we cleaned up after the test where it failed so we know it definitely got past this start so it's probably somewhere braking somewhere here in this inspect bit right maybe on our IP address who knows let's see here so this is what is this dot network settings IP address forget exactly what it is that I'm doing there it's definitely breaking here somewhere so let's let's get to that let's build our command file name docker argument command here's where we started so we should be able to get to that without any error because it starts a new process sets the new process start info which is docker so execute docker oh I bet I don't need this here right I think that could be it and then there we go okay so that runs that then it's the process start let's see if we can get to that now okay so proc this is the command whoa so obviously something blew up here exit code has terminated what is the base pregnant invalid operation exception was thrown okay it's not super useful sure state okay where does it have I'm sure it has command here somewhere still know where it's at there's exit time exit code working set what is that even responding priority boost main window handle sign load can raise events associated I don't even see the I don't see anything here just keep it running it see what it blows up on next so this goes into process dot CS standard output stream reader okay well let's get to so it looks like we have to do this let's do this let's do console.log fairway council about right line and then we'll say proc dot there's got to be like a command or something right machine name process name well actually what did I call it arguments argument arguments to bed it and say something just like command process name maybe it's your time user process processor affinity we're gonna go with name a weight proc dot start info going in their arguments and this would be what use your name and why was it that I can't just execute this like the other ones here hmm serpaphin to come in there on there I do docker there Oh cuz I need this let's try this let's do exact our command command and then finish statement done got an IP oh so so I needed to actually return oh I need to return information is the problem proc standard output read line okay that's what the problem is there so this is that you've cleaned it up make it bar start info arguments console dot write line hello Michael jolly how are you thank you for the follow on our day two stacks devs Channel you you may actually have an answer for this so I'm trying to run a docker command that's gonna give me results the docker inspect command specifically where it gives back all the results around like IP address system info blah blah blah that kind of stuff and then I'm trying to get the results right here so I can pull out a specific value right now I'm trying to find the IP address network settings IP address I had this work at some point but now it's not and if you know of a cleaner way to run a process that executes the command and then just takes the results and I can then act on the results I am all yours so let's your rock star info file name what's that yeah I want to know what that is console.writeline brach start info got something password I don't have a password I just want to execute the thing but what is you shall to excuse me true should say for this file name get to set the application or document to start okay let's just go ahead and add this say use shelled excuse true okay it's all I need to add there and we'll get to here pop that one off all right stop it's our docker mess here you have this you have a string result thinking about what you just wrote there and streams that process that standard output read to in standard output read a read line maybe I didn't needed to read - oh because of the way I'm issuing the command it should just be the one the one thing Oh instead of my while I see what you're saying read and let's do that and if that oh wait I need that should be fun right yeah I do that yeah yeah yeah okay maybe we just cleaned it up all at the same time wait wait for exit after the b2n oh let's do that Brock wait for exit so we'll do two breakpoints let's jump into that mess let's see where we get here build works I don't know how it started executing this differently with JetBrains writer but the build is actually dramatically faster than what I was doing a week or two ago that looks correct let's look for a seven six three zero Batta Batta Batta Batta there so dr. PS and that is seven three what D just said that is the wrong container yeah no I'm not sure what the heck is going on oh I wonder if this is so this is true it's filename is docker okay so that that stuff looks right but that is not the right command like this 763 0 III b2 is not the docker that I am looking for yeah stick no like oh man yep that's kind of I feel like that's where I'm at let's hear so why would why would that why would that container name not be the right thing feel like I'm missing something and let's take a look because that's the one that I suspect it just created the docker PS yes the Dockers oh and I bet no it's still just the one no no if there's the other one so that was the last one the way this was the last one this is the one we were trying to use it just got created so it had to write information but that one looked like it wasn't running well let's let's clean it up so look docker remove Cassie yes you know dr. PS all docker removed Cassie seven three something and then doctor remove Cassie the other one so maybe maybe that'll fix it huh yeah Cassie name is wrong which is really just it's it's the container name I called it Cassie because it's a Cassandra node nothing's running let's just run it and see where we get here okay build succeeded in like half a second and then nope okay we get here to 2f all right it's it's right now that's what we've won so all this stuff looks good here I hope yeah f10 so now I'm gonna I'm gonna start the process and see if I nuke it all okay stuff is running so then read 2n okay so it's it's breaking on the read to end reads the other thing was breaking to so what is this saying though it's saying wait for start I don't know maybe a my if I do proc dot start does it just let's see here let's let's pull up some let's get some Doc's going on here c-sharp process start read read standard output so it's a it's a property that still seems so freakin weird to me start info you shall execute standard output a redirect to standard up need us do that let's add that redirect to standard output all right let's start and streamreader what do I need to do that [Music] that might work better so if I need a stream reader all right so I got the reference and then this is proc then this whatever okay and then output I do it so output then becomes oh they do a console.writeline on that console dot write line output don't need that this can be output I think and what else do they do so they do wait for exit here so I think wait for exit before the return is okay I hope let's see what do you what are you saying here Wow directly a did a Sarah wait started I run commands from an angular front and calling to the core API runs bash commands within the container it just presses that start the line I mentioned above then process wait for exit create no window true the process to enter yeah I don't I don't know I think like if you execute this like if you build it and you you set it to an executable right and you run that executable like double-clicking or from the CLI itself I think it'll create a window but I think as running it into IDE like this I don't think it'll create a window or it or it kills it anyway but maybe I new data set that let's let's do that to just for good measure huh creating a window true okay and then all right press the exit I don't need that I just want to print it all out and because oh okay so maybe this works it actually reads a lot better than what I had there before I mean it could be that the IDE is crashing the window if it's creating one right because I mean the IDE would probably do that if it's expecting a terminal and then all of a sudden the whole app launches and it doesn't know what to do with it I don't know find out in a minute though so let's as usual nip this docker stop kasi that's just a good example to how long it takes docker to actually remove there I mean stop the container and then I'm gonna run to remove if I learn how to type docker remove kasi right there we go yeah so it's gone alright so let's see if we can get to here and we'll get to here I feel like this weird dual instantiation should be and could be cleaned up too okay so we got to that the reader I'm saying okay so get docker address blah blah blah 73 and 17 that's right 73 here and it's in program 17 ok well that's that's where we are or that has not been hasn't been started oh do I need to do wait how's it how do they do it here oh yeah here it is process that start right after that oh let's refactor we're gonna refactor here so let's do this we're gonna make this docker right docker you shall execute true I think I don't need that streamreader see this and then this and down here I'm gonna take the command so this is process dot start info dot arguments full command Oh crud command so right service so they got proc dot start we got the reader we got the output here so and all this stuff could just go oh and then let's do this P address when they gonna string IP address there and then Falls create a new name I know true I should do this false I guess maybe maybe it'll work wait for exit and then return IP address whoa the address here IP address will be equal to output okay that should work I didn't okay where it start oh oh we have just gotten past we have gotten past what we just did so maybe progress maybe progress oh yeah breathe in sweet we have output now which is more from lark okay so that's not exactly in yeah it's not an IP address but hey at least the command is running right so I guess yeah docker lists her doctor doctor PS all right so that's the thing that's running so I want to do docker inspect format and then dot oh do I need to do this Scott netbook network settings dot IP address like this and then Cassie oops No what is it I need to run cuz here's here's the IP address right I I P address once one seven two got seventeen does 0.2 exactly small steps one thing at a time so this I think I can get figured out pretty pretty quick order here so it's your docker get IP address command whatever here's I think this is the exact same thing I was looking at last time when I was trying to get it to work oh it's this weird thing okay so inspect that and I think what's happening here is this is the like format stuff for Windows now or something yeah it's like it thanks let's do this don't put one on the tail in here so I'm gonna give it give me the correct thing let's do a console and we'll get to see what it looks like that's a whole bunch of weird output okay where's the continue stop and rerun yeah oh I do need this whoa okay all the other commands work but still don't have the IP address so let's try this there we go so IP address its Limbaugh slash in see let's go over here so docker inspect all right let's see what's running first PS so we use that one dr. inspect format and what is it's this thing network settings dot IP address that gives the IP so what is what is wrong with my stuff up here so we know we know this is the command but somehow it is it is not the command which is the inherent crux of the problem here so let's stop right here yeah okay so this command is what yeah see it's reformatting this stuff into that thing that's not correct did these do these need escapes no let's oh yeah let's take this out Oh looks right now see if that gets us what we need here oops no no no keep running just keep running /n that is that is not oh maybe if I just do read line because it seems to be doing it's just not giving me the it's reading like the next line or something instead of the first line what is wrong with this so did docker inspect - f double quote curly brace curly brace network settings IP address hillridge Chris race this thing and then go is it let's get rid of that and let's just do copy value okay during it there's the Cassie okay so if we do docker this thing oh I know it's wrong let's hear so Dockers stopped this thing yes okay now let's try it now that that IP will be freed up who did it Oh didn't finish the thing I know it says it removed it so let's hear docker or PS that's a good sign so let's go in and look at all the docker bits and just get rid of those real quick docker kasi see let's build a command right alright alright looks like looks like we might have success here in just a minute run this puppy one more time here exit took off all the breakpoints let's here I don't know real good suggestion and this is process can be far that looks good string concatenation I change it back to that other format it's like it dork tit up oh man my southern came out there for a second worked it up okay here cannot remove running container the stock container before attempting and they need to bump this up some I'm Southern Mississippi Picayune Mississippi 45 minutes from New Orleans 45 minutes from Hattiesburg in 45 minutes from the Gulf Coast of gulfport-biloxi area I lived in New Orleans Covington on the north shore lived up in Memphis lived in Jacksonville which kind of I don't know if Florida really counts it's a different place even though Jacksonville is kind of like southern Georgia you know at least that's what a lot of us always said whenever I lived there yeah that's that's the best thing it like Florida's just Florida it's it's a it's Florida it's its thing so let's here and y'all indeed that's why I have my tweets include y'all because it's the easiest word to use ever all right let's I P address so this this works which is amazing it works except it's taken too long to shut down the thing so maybe if I do let's do 3 here and 3 here so I give it 6 seconds to shut down the thing it's easiest word to use ever well actually he can get it conflated though right cuz you could say y'all y'all's and all y'all y'all you all you I don't know it's more complicated than what I used to use it I just said y'all for everybody everybody and everything all the time yeah you all's alright so okay so there's one here was that the one that did not get deleted okay I'm thinking about ways to make this more complicated I don't think I need to do that right now I need to get back to focus point all y'all that's what I was trying to think of it says all y'all which y'all already means all y'all there is no container now I'm gonna run it and hopefully we get the right thing up here it's like the Mario Brothers soundtrack of the future boom it's working it's totally working ah beautiful just needed another second in there so start up six seconds is more than enough shut it down six seconds it takes a good four or five seconds for it to shut down and then removing it only takes a second I got the break in there anyway so that that's cool so with that done though maybe I see if I put in to sleep in here though would it make it wait in the order of the I ain't gonna mess with this works okay so now if we go back over here so this is the example right that I ran all of that from this is the object which has all the commands etc on earth II the project that has the class that is the object that is instantiated with the variables that are pertinent to the particular Cassandra instance that needs to be started then shut down and destroyed so that migrations can be run against that particular instance of Cassandra that was a tongue twister I still don't know if I used all the particular vocabulary correctly but the information was there key pertinent pieces of information so there's there's our docker bits part one of this whole this little trip hey cus c'mon welcome to the data stacks devs channel data stacks Pachi Cassandra and DSC C sharp our with yours truly Adrian we just got the docker stuff to work in C sharp so that major accomplishment there and I'll be streaming later to on my channel doing some other Nazi sharp stuff so I don't want that I want this what's our time point our time point is like 1 hour 29 seconds 10 minutes so let's see where can we get with this then so get back over here to the core the core lib test look at all the test helpers which builds up our whole environment and then the core Lib tests on these were the ones that we're breaking still rest of this stuff works I believe yep and get back up here so it's your verified destination database that should work now let's go take a look at this functionality though go to declaration there we are all right so this you need to add all this stuff in here so destination database [Music] destination database why is this Oh what were you saying this lady's not that Darrell stuff in JavaScript in for that story yeah c-sharp Oh JavaScript at typescript yes and and c-sharp would be familiar to read upon using typescript there's a lot of similarities there and that's what I'm using for this particular project the schema migration for Apache Cassandra data stacks enterprise which will eventually have migrations for graph data time series geo all that kind of jazz so it'll be pretty encompassing and pretty useful which will be awesome right now those still in kind of the development mode I'm trying to remember his echos doing here so this is this is the class in the core library of the actual schema migration tool that I'm trying to build the console well it just it does this but eventually the console will have all the CLI goo for using the kasi core Lib that I'm writing right now which right now I'm using tests X unit unit tests as integration tests to test the core library code and then eventually once I get the core functionality written using tests as integration tests I'm gonna just basically wire up the whole API into a console and then we'll be able to use it as a CLI app in Linux Windows or whatever you got so so that's your alright so that console but really do anything we run the yeah Tess so technically C sharps been cross-platform since 2001 but that was a somewhat disingenuous notion but now it is 100% open-source and 100% [Music] cross-platform with the.net core stuff like the old dotnet whatever the last one was I think 4.6 dot - 4.6 dot a member what it was but uh those that version of stuff is there and available still but it is not like you can't build stuff on it and expect it to run cleanly on Linux or Mac but with dotnet core this stuff pretty much runs everywhere it run on whatever operating system you put it on and what libraries are available for dotnet core because it kind of is it's kind of an entire rewrite those libraries are compatible across the systems so and there is course just like writing the go CL lives with some of the other things I've done things like that you do have to make nuance in the code of making sure you use the libraries for like paths and things like that because then the CLI will know based on the operating system that it's on like which slash to use for instance right but otherwise yeah it's pretty much 100 percent I haven't had I haven't had any problems running it on any operating system that I put it on and I've been using JetBrains writer because JetBrains writer is fully cross-platform itself it's written in Java somewhat ironically and it it's the way that you can get like the resharper tools in an IDE cross-platform because with Visual Studio the like the full Visual Studio you can get resharper and you get a lot of refactorings and stuff like that with Visual Studio but that's not available outside of Windows and then Visual Studio code no naming conflict there lulz sarcasm just in case my facial expression didn't show the the Visual Studio code prod which is based off that like that atom core JavaScript stuff it is cross-platform fully and you can do net core stuff in it but there's a big but the refactoring capability of resharper is not there and resharper is extremely extremely powerful so when I write c-sharp code I like to have the power of the resharper engine in there and you see me hit alt enter a lot and use the little shortcuts to like clean up code cleanup variable names things like that do renames all sorts stuff in Visual Studio code has a little bit of that but it doesn't have the full scope of introspection and things that actually go out into the code and dig into the code to basically tell you what's going on in your own code base not so bad when I've written all the code like this project but if it's any other project like I don't I don't know what somebody else has written so that is why I use JetBrains writer a lot of that capability and as you see though I also have code here but I'm just putting notes in it and markdown so where we at here verify connection return false and then here it says I see I have a run run Cassandra here destroy Cassandra tear down migrations so let's see about running just this unit test I think I have like a little yeah run run that one execute up migration okay so I did run that but then let's hear what what happened oh I just have this over here migrations to execute migrate go to declaration what see like that right there all enter boom removes the dis that doesn't need to be there I also just don't remember oh I just put false probably to make the test run but the migration actually needs to occur here ah so this is where I need to I need to set up first thing yeah Windows isn't bad to develop on fighting means you can definitely do a lot of stuff just gets complicated when you've been when you've been doing a lot of web stuff Linux stuff or even working on a Mac OS trying to go to Windows usually means you have to do a lot of additional work but if you're using Windows from the start and you write specifically from the context of Windows first then you learn how the tooling needs to work on it and it's not particularly any more complicated than the other platforms it's just that eventually you will probably need to deploy your application to the other platforms that's my only qualm with Windows alright so my grade is I'm gonna make a note here so that is done here what we need to do is next steps I'm gonna actually mark this as incomplete and this one is going to be incomplete and then down here though we'll have us uh next steps for next streaming session we'll get into the integration test start first with the migrate yeah the migrate path migrate path method probably what I need to do is that's not what I want there we go so what I probably need to do is get in here so migration path is one thing it's got certain amount of functionality file selection is one thing so the way I've written out these classes to work is file selection is what I use to actually look in a path or directory I just I just had my headphones drop on my leg and I thought it was like a ant or something but yeah so okay file selection file selection goes through and actually looks at the files that need to be included in a migration then the migration path is what takes the results of verified files so the way that the files are verified is it picks them by used filename and extension to make sure that they're the kind of files that we're looking for migration path then takes those files and pulls the contents of the files into it basically a list like a dictionary list that then can order them appropriately and set them up to do either migration up or migration down destination database is going to be my object that's actually responsible for basically doing the read right from the database connecting to the database and reading and writing to the database so the next step is to flesh out this destination database bit here so let's put that in the notes and then finish migration execution all right then we're gonna look at next steps features to build all right so that really gets us in a good position oh yeah we need to also determine the next steps around key spaces because key spaces are like tables right you have to have or not not tables they're like the database itself like if you were writing running a migration against Postgres or sequel server you'd have a database already created the migrations would then be the schema and tables being created inside that particular database with Cassandra though or data stacks Enterprise we have key spaces which then have tables created inside of that write by proxy of that we need to have that key space created though because the key space can be in flux or whatnot so we need to create how should I put it we need to create some logical criteria around key spaces even though key spaces could technically be part of the migration the issue is just like with just creating a database or destroying a database you could put that into your migration but migrations are not supposed to destroy data on migrate ups right they only destroy data on migrate down when you destroy the entire database so in this particular situation we would not want to I guess we could make key spaces part of the migration but at some point we have to change from a key space or we have to change into that key space to run the schema so it could be but on the way down if you destroy the key space you've effectively wiped out the entire thing which breaks a little bit of the notion of not I mean you you basically have to have extra permissions specifically to create and destroy key spaces just like you have to have the extra permissions to create and destroy databases if you have that capability sure that's great if not what we really need to be able to do is just designate in a migration what key space to use and then run the up and run the down with cql that's actually not that hard so yeah well we'll talk about that again on the next session because that is an interesting paradigm it's a little bit different than a database itself from a functional perspective running schema migrations but it's not so different that we couldn't put it in there but yeah that is a good topic to start off the next session on so with that I am going to let everybody go and if you want to join me later in about 15 minutes I'll actually be streaming on my own channel doing a little bit of NGO programming and other things so join me there for now this is the data stacks Apache Cassandra and DSCC sharp our signing
