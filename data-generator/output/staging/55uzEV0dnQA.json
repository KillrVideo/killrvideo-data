    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems welcome to a slightly different version of the distributed data show I'm your guest host Katherine Eriksson I've been on the show a couple times as a guest and I even held the title for most views for like seven days so today we're going to talk about disruptive innovation the show is targeted towards anyone that wants to build novel products we have Mattias as our guest from the CTO opposite data stacks tell us a little bit about yourself and why this topic excites you yeah absolutely sorry I worked with Jonathan Ellison the CTO office so we were looking at innovation at data stacks and the technology stack previously I was a co-founder of arelius working on the Titan graph database we got acquired by data stack so that's how I ended up at data stacks and before that I did my PhD at the University of Maryland so I've always been very interested in innovation particular technology innovation and in recent years particularly trying to figure out how to make disruptive innovation happen and how to be successful at doing that ok so what are some examples of disruptive innovations maybe over the last 10 or so years I mean a big one that we're sort of all dealing with is the cloud obviously that was a huge disruptive innovation that has changed how we consume compute resources if you look at particular technologies like distributed databases have definitely disrupted the database landscape quite a bit and then you know looking at blockchain in recent years or if you look at if you look at self-driving cars things of that nature that are really changing the way that we can interact with the world around us on those types of technologies that really change the landscape those I would characterize as disruptive ok so what do we do do we do we crowdsource some funding and just our building or is there process where do we start exactly just just start building and hope for the best no in all seriousness then when I first started doing innovate like the the way you go about is you have an idea you build it you go out there you see if it's successful and you hope for the best and and a lot of startups start that way there's a good idea and then it starts growing and as we all know most startups fail so there's you know there's that side of the equation where we're oftentimes you obviously cannot predict the future so we need to try a lot of things and some of them will fail actually most of them will fail some of them will succeed but if you follow a process if you follow certain steps and have a certain type of thinking you can greatly increase the likelihood of being successful and that's one of the things that I'm really interested in and trying to learn more about is like what can you do ahead of time to make it more likely that you will end up with an innovation that actually matters meaning that actually delivers value to customers ok so where do we start do we start with an idea do I start with a problem well most often yeah most def nozanne engineer you start with a I have a great idea I have a great solution that I want to sell bring to the market or work with but you end up being more successful if you take a step back and look at the problem that you're trying to solve so the the for me the most important understanding the most important distinction to make was between the problem space and the solution space right like if you think about innovation successful innovation is something that solves a particular problem and it's really helpful to in your head distinguish the two there's the problem meaning there is a particular person not an individual but a particular group of people that have a particular need that is not being currently addressed and then there's a solution that solves that need in a way that is you know business feasible and keeping those two separate is really really useful so you have an idea and you want to explore the problem so how do you explore that problem space so one of the things that you need to do and one of the things that I always hated doing was you actually need to talk to people that have the problem right that is why I mean that's one of the things that yeah you just kind of you have to get out of the building and talk to people and and really find out a lot about the problem even if you start in the solution space which for a lot of Engineers myself included it comes more natural you you very quickly jump to you oh I have a great idea how I can use artificial intelligence to do this and that even when you start there to go back and be like okay what am I actually solving when I do this and Who am i solving this for and then to identify those people go seek those people out and talk to them and really understand very deeply what their problem is so we often use the example the the Ford example do I need you know a faster horse you know if if they were looking for a house faster horse they wouldn't have invented the car what's the saying there yeah exactly that's what it's one of the one of the famous ones where you say basically if Ford allegedly said if I had asked people what their problem is they would have said they needed a fast a horse and and the saying is kind of sometimes abused in the context of it's not that useful to talk to people because they're very bad at telling you what they actually need but I think the saying has a deeper truth to it which is people are actually very good at identifying problems right when you say I need a faster horse what you're saying is I need a faster mode of transportation so the person has correctly identified the problem they just misidentified the solution for it okay a faster horse right it's very hard to make horses faster just by allow me you can breed them but there's a certain limit to how fast the worse can go but when you look at when you take a step back from what the customer actually said or the person said in that context is that they identified a need that needs to be addressed and that's what you need to look for is to look at to really drill down into those needs that are being articulated even if the way that they articulate them as in this particular famous example is a solution oriented one you really want to take a step back and go back to the problem what is the problem that they have and how can you solve it so how does how does finding that that problem space and and iterating in that problem space what does that do for you in the solution space it really helps you understand whether your solution solves a not just a problem but an important enough problem so one of the things that we realized early on when you do for instance in the space of databases that I am in like there are just so many things that you could do right there's so many great ideas for technology so many cool novel innovations that you can engage with one of the challenges is to understand which of those matter enough that people would actually be willing to pay money for it I'll actually engage with you in the first place alright so one of the things that going back to the problem space does for you you can zoom out a little bit and understand what the context is in which that problem occurs and understand what are other problems around that and is this problem actually important enough for our customers that they are seeking out a solution for it one of the challenges so one of the early things was when in for me in the graph database field is you go back to a customer and you say hey here's this you know novel graph index that I want to build and does this and that isn't this cool when you go to a customer with this kind of approach they will say yeah that's really cool and then you go back and say wow my idea was validated but what you're missing is you haven't really asked how this yeah how this really addresses the wide array of problems that they might have and whether this actually ranks anywhere in their top 5 ok so you have an idea you take that idea and you really explore the problem space around the idea so it sounds like you're you're kind of narrowing narrowing the scope ok so we've narrowed this go we're back into the solution space where do we go next right so you you haven't you identified a problem which typically means you know a particular group of people like or you have a persona that you used to identify a group of people that have a particular need and now we're trying to figure out how can I solve further needs so there's a bit of an iteration that goes on typically as you explore the solution space did you get more insight on what the problem is because you can take certain ideas and you can iterate on them show them to people or talk to them about particular solutions and that typically helps people articulate the problem better so you go through that cycle but once you feel like you have really zoomed in on a particular problem that you feel is worthwhile then the next thing you want to do is you want to establish product market fit ok so so where do we start with with product market fit I feel like we have a the product idea so we we look at the market fit where do we go all right so the first thing you want to do is you want to look at the market but you want to make sure that the market is a feasible market which basically what that says is that the market is one where you expect to make enough of money or where you expect that building the particular product that you're interested in is justified by the size of the market and by how much people would be willing to pay for it so one of the things that that you start with typically is with what's called the total addressable market or Tam for short so you try to find an estimate for how big is this market overall how big is the total addressable market okay so let's talk about about that maybe with a concrete example we're in the database market maybe we use Cassandra right so I want to build a distributed database and so my market is alright so you would say you'd start with the total of the rest of our market would be the entire so in our case Cassandra being an operational database you would say my total addressable market is the operational database market right so that's the market in which you would position yourself and then you can go to I mean this pretty Hansons Gartner or semana other analysts would be able to tell you what the total size of the operational database market is and I don't actually know the exact figure but I think it's somewhere at 35 40 billion something like that and then they tell you how much it grows year over year so that gives you sort of a rough this is how big the market is but it's important to take that as a starting point only like a lot of people like stop there and be like oh wow we have this big market opportunity now let's go innovate the next thing is total addressable market actually breaks down into service addressable market and then share of market so the next thing you want to figure out is within that large market how much of that are you actually targeting because we're not actually with Cassandra or distributed database and generally not actually talking the entire operational database market we're looking at those that need and distributed okay's right so that's like that's the service address of a market so the part of the market that is addressable by the product of you building okay so there was a third definition there as well right right that the third one is the share of market so once you are in your market you try to identify how much of that service addressable market can we reasonably capture because you always have competitors and even if that competitor is just not using you in the first place like even for somebody who has that need but might not choose to use you so you want to figure out how much of that market can I actually reasonably capture so how much how much can I get people on board through marketing how much of that share is going to go to my competitors so you want to figure out those numbers so you can get an actual somewhat accurate estimate of what is your entire opportunity for your particular innovation okay so you go through this exercise and you have this idea that you believe in and from the from the beginning from your exploration of the problem space you have a solution that you know solves the problem are there times where you work through the second step this market fit step and you say well I have a solution and I I don't have somebody that wants to use it yeah so there's I mean yeah there's the part of the product market fit where you want to make sure that you are actually and this is where the fit comes in so once you know that you have the market the fit part is do I actually have a product that satisfies that market but in a way that really is meaningful to you to your customer and that takes on different shapes like one of it is obviously that you want to build a product that is actually doing the thing that needs to be done in order to solve the problem all right like so in a case of a district we do base it's pretty obvious you want the database to be able to distribute and scale out and be highly available like does does you probably actually do that but there are other elements that you need to take into consideration which are things like can you actually message that so can you actually reach your target audience with that kind of message like sometimes and this is particularly true in the technology space like some of the solutions that we're building a very a highly complex and so it is non-trivial to communicate to particular target customer time what you're building and what the value is right so can you actually communicate this succinctly and and does this resonate with your target audience that's another thing you want to test fairly early on before you go down the rabbit hole of like building out everything and building this wonderful technology and then you step back and you're like sure we have no idea how we can communicate this in a way that actually resonates with our target audience so in that case you have a product that solves the problem you have an addressable market and and you don't have the the value proposition for the customer but exactly that don't be don't be a real shame right because at that point you have invested so much oh you're closed at that point you've got to go back you're so close yeah and that's where a lot of these things that we're just talking about like you really should think of them as more of things because you're constantly learning as you do these things right so we're kind of talking about them as sort of a step by step kind of guide but a lot of these things like initially you would do a sort of a rough t'aime salmon some estimate you would then look at can we actually capture that market do we have the right messaging and then you would start incrementally building out some of those things right so you would start for instance building a landing page right and try to figure out if the message that you have resonates with your customers that's a very easy way to do so my next question was going to be when can we start writing code right our viewers are your code they've they've worked through the birth your product market fit they we think we have a good understanding of the market now it's time to start writing code do we just move forward from here do we iterate back through what's what's the process right so so the the most important thing I think is that to think of product market state is never a binary thing it's not like a switch that kind of flips at some point where you like yeah we don't have part of market we don't and it's suddenly boom we have product market fit oftentimes it is portrayed that way because you have that sort of hockey stick growth curve that happens when you establish true product market fit but that really glances over the fact that there were so many iterations before where you could see that you were getting closer and closer to part market fit and that's really that is the critical element to think of it from like a okay initially we might just be doing mock-ups right and you just draw something on a napkin to show it to a bunch of people you have conversations right and you get close to the part market fit that way later in the stage you do prototype so I do writing up you know web apps or simple simple examples of what you're trying to build not fully functional but just functional enough so people can get the idea of what you're trying to do and and you start coding a little bit but I guess the most important thing that I had to learn was to think of everything that you do as a hypothesis all right everything that you want to do when it comes to product market fit whether it's on the market side whether it's on the product side or the persona side all these things are really things that you cannot fully know right you're trying to make those those are essentially guesses because if it was fully known somebody else probably would have done it like it's not really a disruptive innovation if everything is knowable advance right like somebody else would have done this already so everything that you're doing is likely some kind of guest some kind of a hypothesis you believe that this value is being delivered or you believe that this particular technology choice can accomplish a certain thing and so what you want to do is you basically want to write up a little booklet where you write down all the most important hypotheses that you have and then the ones that are most critical you try to figure out how what can I do today so that I can de risk that hypothesis okay all right so if there's something that is really critical to your success what can I do to make it less likely that this particular thing is false all right what can I learn today who can I talk to what can I build to reduce that probability okay so a lot of our viewers are open-source contributors so how does this relate from us at a start-up to those wanting to contribute new open-source projects to maybe open source something on their own how does it relate back to that set of viewers yeah the open source is a great way to innovate in particular in a sort of collaborative environment I would say that if you're interested in particular in extending an open source or starting a new open source project it's important to go through some of those steps in order to make sure that what your open sourcing actually matters if that's important to you I mean sometimes open source is more sort of a byproduct of something that you're already doing and then you open source a component of it if you believe open source as a means of like doing something disruptive a novel you can you can look on the community and figure out like what do people actually need like a great way to start is with mailing that's like what are the things that people most often complain about that's a great way to find out what user needs all right and then you know build a simple prototype put it out there it's super easy to do that like you just do a pull request and be like hey here add some idea for how to solve this particular problem and then get feedback on it very early on and I feel like open-source communities are particularly great for that because people are generally very interested in providing feedback and giving you guidance and so that that is from me particular that was the biggest thing I had to learn is that you would as an engineer you're typically the one where you like okay I understand the problem now I'm going to like hide in a closet for a year I'm gonna to hack this out and make this absolutely perfect like just super super perfect and then I'm gonna open source it right right and instead to go back to like well I don't really know if that's actually really needed yet I think I I think there is a value there but I cannot be a hundred percent sure so I like I try to identify what is the component that I'm least sure about and then build something where I can test that and put that out there in the community or put it up in some forum open source or other and try to get feedback on that particular as possible I think that makes sense and so we've we've talked through idea to development and iterating back through and continuing to test the hypotheses where do we wrote where do we go from here how do we take this to the to the next level after after this podcast when we're ready to to you know work through one of these ideas on our own yeah I would say think of hypothesis validation and iteration as a constant and there's there's so many things like it feeds directly into the the whole idea is behind agile and agile development right we tend to get lost in the the process of it and the various incarnations whether it's extreme programming or Kanban or whatever flavor really think of these these things as a means to be able to help you D risk your hypotheses and really make it make it a mindset I I think it's super helpful particular if you're interested in an innovative work in work that is supposed to move the Neil to constantly think in question what is the next thing that I can learn in order to help me understand the problem better in order to come up with better solutions it's a really make that a constant mindset even as you built the product even when the products already out on the market even when you have already established part market fit and you're you know a huge company you like to just keep iterate and keep doing this keep using this process to come up with the next thing and keep going keep going keep learning yeah so I think this has been a bit of a different show but I think this is incredibly interesting I think we're always excited to see what's next what the next disruptive technology is what our users are building with our product and and what's next so any any final works to the builders out there that might be where you are or were you know in a ph.d program thinking maybe this graph database thing will catch on yeah I mean first just sort of a shameless plug is that you know this is what we're doing the CTOs office of data stack so if this is something that you're interested if you're interested in innovation that's a good place to come to so apply at data stacks if you're working for another company if you're doing your own thing just keep learning keep iterating and and you'll eventually get there it can be a very long road but it is it is definitely the rote that gets you to the success the quickest all right thank you so much for joining us today make sure to put this video on repeat so I get my title back and have a great week thank you thank you thank
