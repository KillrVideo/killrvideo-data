  "title": "What's New with Cassandra at Instagram | Ep. 103 Distributed Data Show",
  "description": "In this episode, Jeff Carpenter talks with Dikang Gu about the origins of Cassandra at Instagram, an update on how the adoption of RocksDB as a storage engine for Cassandra is progressing, geographic data partitioning, and how his team is providing Cassandra as a Service inside Instagram.\n\nHighlights!\n0:00 - Welcoming Dikang back to the show and recapping how Cassandra came back into Facebook via the Instagram acquisition.\n1:09 - After starting to use Cassandra at a startup in China in 2010, Dikang now leads the Cassandra team at Instagram and is a committer on the project\n3:14 - Dikang joined Facebook in 2012 and switched over to Instagram after the acquisition in to 2014 and joined the team working on Cassandra full time, which is now up to 7 engineers.\n4:45 - The Cassandra team at Instagram has been working on performance and reliability improvements such as the RocksDB integration. This year they're working on efficiency in compute and storage to help limit hardware growth. \n5:55 - Andrew Whang's talk is about a service Instagram has built to partition data by locality, for example to keep data within a particular country or region. This helps with privacy, efficiency, and performance.\n9:18 - The team is also working to provide Cassandra as a Service within Instagram. Michael Figuiere's talk is about a layer they are providing on top of Cassandra to simplify access and provide traffic management. The API is based on Thrift.\n13:43 - Most of the clusters at Instagram have been migrated onto the RocksDB-based engine. They're continuing to work on updating Cassandra APIs to make the storage engine pluggable, this will be a post-4.0 feature.\n16:01 - Features in 4.0 that Dikang is excited about include virtual tables and the internode communication based on Netty.\n18:08 - Another feature for the future is stronger membership management around the gossip protocol and handling failure.\n22:00 - Looking forward to talks at Accelerate about repair and sidecars.",

    "text": "oh this is Jeff carpenter developer advocates data stacks we're live coming at you from accelerate doing a Sox accelerate I'm here with decaying goo from Facebook Instagram yeah whichever one looks better at then at the time writing it both names on the business part from data stacks this is the distributed data show so we've had you on before yes you were talking about the rocks TV integration as a storage engine in Cassandra or do you even do it and just to kind of recap you know I love the origin story that we have here where Cassandra was first developed as a facebook project and then it kind of fell out of use pretty quickly and then you know was donated open source came under the purview of the Apache Software Foundation became a project but it wasn't really used at Facebook for a long time yes you guys brought it back yeah because you had it an Instagram and then Facebook bought Instagram and then BOOM Cassandra is all over Facebook now again which i think is so funny yeah hello everyone I'm decomp yes a step mission that I right now like at the Instagram right but we use Cassandra you know like I saw you know like one of our critical you know database yeah its powers a lot of Instagram products so yeah we love Cassandra like you bust out a long thing to defend your other days a moment we'll talk you know I've been a little bit because you have some serious credibility standard community longtime contributor give us a little bit of background on yourself sure Fraggle oh cool yeah yeah again like i'm d Tony and I'm currently the manager of the casino developers team at the you see one yeah I'm also like Apache Cassandra I go to be working there yet yes so yeah upon my background so I started to notice any effect in 2010 yeah when I worked for a start-up in China okay at that time you know like so well we were looking for robust distributed that K bodies go I pray our you know product use cases okay and my one of my friend in Silicon Valley they pointed me to send you I think at that time like Cassandra was still like very new right um it just you know graduated Apache and become the top level projects for each end yeah exactly right so but I was right immediately like attracted by Apache Cassandra right because of the architecture and in the features like you know motormaster ultra scouting like there's no single point of failure right and also either provides you know like the petah tikva like data model instead of just a few key body store right so it is sounds you know exactly it is that the database is where we're looking for if so many people have that story to where they just like they didn't necessarily know that they were looking for a technology or a database with those attributes but then they saw it that's like me like yes this is this is pervading just fall in love with that tech yes okay so you're you're leading the team now yes so yeah I'm did a stunt hub I joined the Facebook in 2012 okay and then like I started it to work on you know the HDFS this should be the system for a couple years and I switched her to Instagram in 2014 okay so as some of you may know like Instagram started to use the sender in 2013 so when I joined Instagram like the deployment was still small and if there was no you know like engineer support I'm working on Cassandra oh so that was a perfect fit because you already had that experience with the natural yeah sitting on that part yes a natural aging Oregon I want to you know like if we assume like my experience with Cassandra so you know I see plant growth we start with you know put them one more features on how about Cassandra right I started you know to the comfort I'm working on the Cassandra's car - you know like fixing different issues start with into the other two you know like various improvements to the passengers is that your ability or performance and the eventually like away build a team around Sandra I think it's the one okay oh can you share how big that team is sure I render like we have about a seven percent you developers in squad yeah including like 2% commuters and also like a few other well that's fantastic okay so so what are you guys working on yet so I think like last year like as I mentioned a life before like way work down you know like a different will I bleach it and a performance improvements at a Cassandra example like the the Roxy be pasted a storage engine like wait about 4:30 right around the 2017 and besides that like this year we have two new purposes so why is why is about the efficiency you know like as Instagram grows the demand of Cassandras storage also grows right see connecticut area so because of our scale we want to control the growth of the hardware you know use the bikers and you got to wait another per all the hardware you know exponentially it's not just about storage or is it also about a few key additions yeah that's a good point right yeah we're planning to you know write make it to send you utilize both CPU and that storage more visionary yeah so we have different projects you know try to improve both okay and today like there would be another talk from my colleague Andrew like he will talk about the right to burn project okay so yeah Andrew in song that's in my track okay so yeah yeah recap this talk for a little bit a previous talk for us yes a brilliant so here we'll talk about service repute raising like Instagram the petition you know like the data stored in person Orchestra according to the local idea of we are the requested camera so you know the motivation is started you know how to play poker you know we are building more and more data centers yeah but we cannot afford to place one drop picture of the data in every data center so because of that like we want to for example like if we have users in European we want to only you know place their data in European data centers yeah I mean likewise for us users data will and they want to place them in u.s. sounds like mostly like a privacy compliance kind of things but you think you had in that category of efficiency as well yeah it can help with market or like areas including like privacy like efficiency and also performance as well as you can imagine like if like the users is in Europe and but it is WordPress data in u.s. yeah then like the the access Egypt go cross the continent will be not so so that means like we want to avoid you know like place one copy of the data everywhere but also we want to place the data close to the actual users close to where the requester come from right so that means that we need to determine like where is the I mean which data center life way should a peak out of many like to place the data okay so you're our only replicating reader to certain data centers yes it's that is it still multiple data centers so that you have kind of resilient across how do you keep those things in balance that here I'm talking about the mole versus vocality of going you know mostly to the local data center yeah yeah exactly right I mean the example I gave is about like two continents like a Europe and the US yeah by the way seeing one continent that's cute there are multiple datacenters so okay they're not exactly you know like very close to each other but you know the latency you know within one continent so we're still praised multiple replicas have we seen one continent by the way do not need to place a replica across continents okay that's the right idea yes because we don't lose them any consequence sure yeah we have it we haven't in a while yeah again I get a few interesting like more details yeah I'd recommend it to you know like to go to Andrews talk and you will learn more details about that okay alright what else is going on yes so this is about efficiency the second focus is like we want to you know provide Cassandra as a service with Instagram yeah yeah okay yeah so about the only one I hear of a lot of companies doing this well there's the internal platform team that is trying to provide yeah yeah yeah the high-level motivation is to you know like we want to hide you know the complexity of operating Cassandra over using Cassandra you know we want to hide that all right from you know the product teams okay so that's they they can just be focused on you know their own business logic they do not need to worry about you know like where and how the data you know like that did not stop okay and for us like we are trying to do the for example like the high level abstractions on top of secured because that's their ego to use secure or directed it your cases are extracted from sick you all are you giving him an API yes we gave them like other Facebook will give them you know straight the face the API and also like a way integrator ways you know like Facebook intern or like you know the corrupted model okay so that people can use I mean standard API at Facebook - pirate deeper in the backend and the concern is one of the bear in the backend from the back yeah okay so how interesting that threat is kind of on its way migrated out Cassandra is that internal mechanism but actually it's a it's a perfectly acceptable inter-process communication mechanism at the application layer maybe not at the database yes yeah so upon say yeah we're Debbie we're aware of that so we're building you know a new middle yeah we call it a gateway Facebook so what it does is that it was translated us raped API into the secure protocol okay so again I another colleague from my team like McHale yeah he's also a core developer you know like he's in the community as well so he will give a talk about to get away tomorrow likes to share more details about the middle area you know it provides the new like through its API yeah and also like it enables us to have more flexibility of controlling the traffic to different eccentric casters so for number it will be easier for us to do except biggest altering like go dependency tibanna control et cetera ok so it's literally a distinct tier yes stick nodes I guess yeah yeah ok is that separate to your future and taking our you know the clients I look at real kiss on your servers okay and then it's or is it providing some kind of um balancing kind of capabilities or redundancy or what they're like operational values and it's giving you beyond just the translation yes so you know like that okay two atria is field on top of the send your java secure either you know that's equal to ax or idea by the some start off with other financing okay but it's not a compact so Victor has a lot of ideas to how to you know improve the low dependency okay specially in multiple data center multiple regions in there right right that's one of the that's one of the challenges and I don't know if you guys have looked at the data stack driver driver the 4.0 version we kind of backed away of some of those policies that do failover of queries to other data centers yeah and mostly it's just like preferential to the local data center that's the default policy yes now you know from now on sure I mean it's working for most of the case yet is not perfect for example like when you should wave from the inside in the making or overload of wine region yeah even though like we have enough capacity in other regions so we're definitely well we're actively working right to men so you want to kind of do your own pluggable policies where you can you can have a fine-grained control over time which makes perfect sense it's like there's no it's almost like everyone's infrastructure is different enough that it's harder to find a one size fits all sure for that kind of okay so what's what's coming next like what's on the roadmap yeah that's a good question so I think it ran our life away you have like different focuses and one of them you know it is the dogs dogs TV based a storage engine yeah so as you know like wait developers storage engine in 2017 and under this moment where are they you know migrated or most of our internal production clusters yeah the last time we talked you were kind of midway through that process yeah rolling that into production yeah early on yeah exactly yeah so on my hand like way continued to improve performance reliability of the rocks to be based engine to make it you know life to make the even more you know high throughput low latency on the other hand the light we are also like over implementing to find the features on top of that right so for example right we are working on the back half because it's very critical to a database yeah and also where well as we start to implement the secondary index on top of the dogs TV storage engine to be able to say no light speed up some of the powers which may require indexing right okay so you haven't had that yet prior to now on top of Y and on the other side is still working for West yeah so I mean also like in the community right you know like we started at the effort to you know try to make Cassandra's storage engine to be pluggable right so the other way can contribute at the rocks to be based the engine you know okay to the upstream right so at this moment I think the communities is a risk both are zero testing so I really hope you like 14.0 you know testing is finished and the forethought is there Roy's release okay we can resume there for the - you know right - right because there's a reader refactoring it's not the api's aren't quite as clean as we want them to be yet to be able to do that okay so that's a post for dot oh yes no biggie okay are you guys are you guys tracking or excited about Toronado or you've already been playing around with the preview yeah I'm quite excited about you know like different features and improvements in photo right especially you know like since like the virtual tables will help a lot of ways you know operating of the casino classroom and I saw the new energy based internal messaging implementation we believe it well you know like improve the throughput my schematic improvements for that infernal streaming virtual tables maybe not everyone knows what that is or what that can provide free annealing truck it was I'm not Sean oh sure yeah I think Oh Jeff maybe he is he is a man like commitment behind it this feature okay you know like I can you know like to talk a little bit about yeah so for example today like Cassandra exposed matrix in gem X Gen X only yeah Jimmy so in our you know Department and you know like we need to implement our own you know like scripts trying to you know like right monitor you know like or trying to fetch the metrics from thousands of Chile Jim is my dream I've always found Jim next to be extremely awkward I mean I know it's great and powerful and all this but it's also it's very difficult to sort of navigate it's a different sort of mindset to kind of navigate that that tree of metrics yeah is that to it yeah right so accessing it like a Cassandra cable she's still gonna be so powerful yeah he said to it like I mean that's the purpose of the virtual table right yes it's not a real contender table but you know like a you can you know like run secure against that it has a familiar API yeah so you can use it just as a normal table but you're actually you can you know for example you said that you fetch the matrix you want right so which will make your bottom of your tuning more consistent you're monitoring like easier by you know fetching the matrix okay who under the certain seem like it's also is a big thing like where our interests we're looking at right now is a stronger membership management in Cassandra so okay yeah we're interested Richard what are we talking about when we say members sure so in Cassandra you know like I said just should be the database yeah and also like you assign tokens you know to all the nodes in the posture right so membership will be exclusive when is what are the nodes in the cluster right now who's in who's out yes the second is right which node or switch token they see that the magic they took a token under the action node right so you can imagine it's very critical because you know for every leader write a request we need to catch the latest membership information so that you can redirect the traffic kids are correct the traffic box okay so this is gossip we're talking about yes Joseph is a protocol to trying to manage and try to synchronize the membership view on different repeaters okay but you know like a gossipy is not a very strong consistent protocol it's more like it's peer to peer right which means everyone like every replica manages the membership view by itself they have their own perspective or their own view of the world yeah what they can see yes sir I don't Instagram like you know like we have a very large deployment yeah and also you know like way proactively you know to simulate large failures to test unfortunately measure of the of Cassandra we do find you know like in some like in some case especially you know like doing the while we shed down or one way the store you know like a large percentage of the row because the gossip of the membership view like took a long time longer time to actually be consistent settle down yeah they said that you're talking about large India's what are we talking about you're killing like multiple nodes at the same time okay yeah actual edger than that so in facebook like with per article II like you know like to try to simulate to the Phidias of a wine region okay right very clear up your article oh yeah like the keynote 30 morning we were taking an entire data center so we will try to you know like take the hood it is in the offline and then I try to bring them back yeah and I see if the center you know cast you perform well I in this extreme like scenarios okay yeah and the between the process would you define that you know like as I mentioned like the calls with you and the Incans its can be inconsistent sometimes and also like we also uncover you know a lot of other issues like the low the balancing we already talked about like you know like the gossip events may not be about you may not be handled you know very diligently okay yeah there are like also sounds to me like okay's Coburn's right as well okay so you guys been working on some improvements yes so yeah we're looking forward to away or a new light I agree the improvements killed our membership since that is no like weekend and tolerant large affiliate spider and also like it can help us to paralyze our operations with them more like we can push up multiple nodes at the same time we can you know like run the replacement the placement of notes I mean in Kerala like as well critical you know like we actually improve the durability and the availability of our system so that sounds like more post 4.0 yeah kind of changes yeah it's a some it's a very big and a challenging project okay so it'd be our kind of our longer-term like I approach all right well you probably wrap things up here and it was talking for a while its mother guess we're gonna get on the air but what are you 40 you have any talks in particular that you're looking forward to accelerate or what are you hoping to get out of the conference this week sure I just see them a lot of interesting talks in their conference for example like that's talks about actually there are much more talks about how to do that repair you know like more visionary yeah more driver they like there's a lot of creative energy that's gone into that the operational pain I'm looking for the you know to learn more about that and also I'm looking for that you see you know like we can unify this effort to you know life instead of everyone building their own better tools right it's pretty great that you can contribute that you identify the sidecar something like that to you that's right conversations there that are often kind of in the same stream is that like repair processing and also this idea of a sidecar approach yeah aside power projects yes cinnamon approach with with varying selling points and so yeah this is a great opportunity for us to get some of those people in the same room that don't get to see each other face to face all the time yes a great week for that yes exaggerated yeah so I mean those are kind of I really like related to presenting internalized operations yeah I don't mean why I do see a lot of interesting use cases as well yeah well like there are talks from Yahoo Japan you also have a large percentage of departments there right and also there are some other talks about you know like how to integrate at the center ways for example Kafka or which you know like some offline say the pipelines or and the districts yeah so I'm looking forward to those comps as well awesome it's been great having you on thanks for coming back and thank you for yeah thank you for you might you might meet you though yeah yeah we appreciate the big support I'm working on some green box it's fantastic thank you all right I'll see you",
