    "text": "hi there if you like powerful distributed systems and capable tools focus on because we are going to bring them together that's the intro to kate sandra video which shows us how we do we run cassandra apache cassandra on kubernetes with a native project open source project called kate sandra so i'm going to show you the first few steps how easy it to install and start using apache cassandra on kubernetes with kate sandra so that's my linux box i'm to make it a little bit bigger for you and we are going to execute some commands to install the things first one we are going to need is helm helm is like a package manager for kubernetes if you know it already you know how convenient it is to use helm charts to install even very complex applications we are going to install this way kate sandra and first thing we are doing is just to add repository for kate sandra to install things and second thing i'm going to use is traffic you know we use kubernetes ingresses to accept incoming connections and route them to a proper services traffic is the ingress like that we could have been using nginx for example but we prefer traffic for this use case you will see soon why okay so with that done that's enough enough for us to update the repositories and i see what we successfully got an update from traffic chart repository and from kate sandberg chart repository uh if you are not familiar with helm it may be not just completely clear to you what we are doing right now but that's very easy we can say it's like update update very similar to that now i'm going to install ingress for our project so you will see everything what's going on inside and i'm doing helm install command uh the installation will be called traffic from traffic helmet chart and i will use traffic yama configuration file we will take a look at it in a second so initialization of installation takes like a second or about that see what traffic deployment was done and that's the first revision and while it's being started so we can take a look at pubesity get pots for example watch okay so my port for traffic is being started it will take a moment as long as we wait for it we can take a look at that traffic yaml file and it's very very very simple file here so we basically just explained to traffic what and how has to be explore exposed so we are opening some um incoming points and that will be a type note board of course so you don't use not port on your production but that's a demonstration so don't judge me very well so i guess we have uh traffic already running yes we do and at this point we can open traffic dashboard traffic comes with a very nice dashboard which describes everything what we have in this setting so we have two routers of http type four services and basically that's it i will not make a deep dive dive into that that's not about traffic but in general that's what you get in the traffic dashboard which helps you to understand what are the routers and services what incoming calls are being distributed to your services currently there is nearly nothing just internal uh traffic things let us go on we still have a lot of things to do okay so we have ingresses prepared now we need something about kate sandra idea is very very simple with kelm i am install kate sandra exactly like i do i just did with traffic with helm install command it's going to be helm install named kate sandra kitsan locates under repository and configuration file kate sandra you guess we are going to check this file in a moment but first let's take a look what's going on internally so i'm going again to watch cube ctl get pots to see how the system develops over time and you see like there is a lot of work going on so there are some very interesting things and there are a lot of pods starting first traffic you know already we've seen it before it's a traffic ingress now we have here 800 default uh stateful set zero so that's the main cassandra instance running it has zero pots ready it's going to have two one for cassandra and one for management api sidecar when what we having casperator here is the one who is going to manage all the cassandra operations like scaling changing them settings and we have to do a rolling update for example so cass operator is your own engineer a virtual engineer which executes all the operations with cassandra with no need for you to take care of that which is great i love this guy when we have stargate which is a secret sauce we will say a little bit later but what about that grafana prometheus those are pretty familiar we use them to monitor as you see we use a lot of the tools not just to have only cassandra running you know that's not enough we know what that's actually pretty a lot of work to have cassandra running but we need to have proper monitoring over that so we have parameters and graphan install it they are included in the decade sandra of course you can use your own so batteries are included but swappable if you don't like our prometheus and graffana if you have something already you're completely good to go with them but i want to show you how it works all together seamlessly in a single setup when we have reaper if you have never met reaper before it's responsible for repair operations and it's a great tool uh heavily developed by the last picol team and originally i believe was developed by spotify team so reaper is a reaper operator is running but waiting before because we need to have cassandra fully operational before and now we will happen some more changes so ripper operator seeing what we have cassandra running will execute some bootstrapping for reaper so it will be ready to execute repairs while we're waiting for that let's take a look about other things we are executing first of all i bet you are curious about the kate sandra yummy file i have applied it's well not so big not so small file so we can take a look at some basics of that let me open it again okay looks better so there are definitions and settings we want to use for our k200 deployment and first and of course first is cassandra and you see what we are using version 3 11 10 storage class standard some settings for java some settings for resources and some settings for data centers basically those settings all go to cass operator uh explaining what do we want to have from the cassandra point of view but we also have some more settings so we have stargate here which i will explain later we have a reaper definitions here so we will have reaper running notice so let's enable it true of course uh q prometheus stack so we have grafana and cube install it also as well of course you can disable disable that so meanwhile we can take a look at our oops we can take a look at our ports and you see what ripper shamma and reaper ripper shema has been completed and now reaper is running it means what bootstrapping for repair operations is done already and basically what i did for that i say it in my configuration file reaper is enabled and now it's fully operational and ready to execute repairs for me which is great like i'm a lazy developer that's incredible to have the things automated for me perfect so let's take a look at the things going on in traffic and you see like there is a lot of things changed already we have now ten routers not two and ten services not four let's take a look what's inside here we see what we have now much more roots regarding prometheus for example some stargate roots grafana and others and reaper of course and we also know we have a lot of services opened for us so we can start using them that's some of stargate grafana prometheus and reaper what's included by default so uh what comes next monitoring we see what grafana and prometheus are running already so let's take a look my uh first hero here is prometheus we use prime methods for to collect metrics from apache cassandra with metrics collector for apache cassandra an open source project and basically we can work with things here we want to see like i don't know collect d metrics collector apache cassandra histogram for p 95 and i execute and we have some results already or we can switch to graph but you know what if you need graphs already well mostly probably prometheus is not the best tool we have something much better so in the next step here i have grafana grafana is installed the uh together with kate sandra it's an essential part for us and i'm going to admin not to login nope i will not change password and we can have some dashboards here we already have some already so this one is a cassandra cluster condenser by default we have only limited amount of notes and not so much information in the condensed dashboard so we have some information on the cluster status but what i really like is much more information from my point of view is the cassandra general over overview status and that gives a lot of information here so basically when we start to scroll we see the amount of requests for outputs we just since well cluster is just started so we don't have too much and we see read latencies we see what node status is up node count one node by default yes i can scale it up of course uh cluster data size which is pretty minor so far 223 kilobytes usually cassandra works with much bigger numbers and as a stable counts and so on and so forth so basically everything what you need to know about your cluster is already prepared and already inserted here we can see all the details of the cluster we want to have here and finally as we discussed it that's not only about monitoring and deployment we also have a repair management tool install it call it reaper and it's included in this one so we can see how it's able to work with the cluster already again there is nothing to set up from the beginning i see my kate sander cluster with default cluster i've created there are no running repair runs and i can go to schedule and i can should do a new one with cluster kits under well i have only one cluster on this node with a key space well let's say i will choose system for this one i'm going to be owner for this repair start time okay whatever and i want it to happen weekly so i will add this schedule i see this repair schedule it and i can open it in repairs as it was just should do it okay of course i can get back to the schedules push the button right now i have to adjust the time of the start and there is my new repair so maybe i okay now my repair has been scheduled sorry that finger at that and now in repair i see finally my running repair which just started and i see what it affects key space system with 17 tables and i can see that segments how it's being processed step by step so first repair is done already and hours are scheduled and will be executed soon and basically i have a cassandra cluster running monitoring tools and repair tools and later on with the backup tools in just few clicks that's how kid sandra works that's completely open source tool we suggest you to take a look at participate try to run at your own that's the way we think how cassandra should be running on kubernetes and this project is going to be great that's completely open source project and we ask you to join the community try to run it execute some jobs take a look how it happens maybe you report some issues if you find some or better maybe even provide some pull requests that's completely open source hosted on github and we will be happy to see you together with us developing that that was alex volchnev developer advocate for data stacks and we are happy to see you interested in cascade sandra see you next time you",
