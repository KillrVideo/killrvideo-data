  "title": "Distributed Data Show Episode 71: Upgrading Cassandra Clusters with Carlos Rolo",
  "description": "Patrick McFadin talks with “Cassandra Archaeologist” Carlos Rolo of Pythian about best practices for upgrades in Apache Cassandra clusters.\n\nHighlights\n0:15 - Patrick welcomes Carlos to the episode and explains why he’s known as the “Cassandra archaeologist”.\n2:10 - Carlos shares his tips for upgrades: read the documentation, make sure you’re doing backups and testing them, validate that your drivers work on a new version\n3:18 - Doing a test upgrade is recommended, especially from an application perspective\n4:00 - Upgrading across multiple version numbers takes some work, you need to go a step at a time and upgrade SSTables\n5:14 - Online upgrades are the norm - this is a major reason why people choose Cassandra\n6:23 - Changes affecting upgrades to Cassandra 4.0 - check the release notes!\n7:13 - The most difficult upgrades are the ones involving transition away from the legacy Thrift API\n9:35 - The final word - make sure to read the docs when doing upgrades\n\nABOUT DATASTAX ENTERPRISE 6\nDataStax  powers  the  Right-Now  Enterprise  with  the  always-on,  distributed  cloud  database  built  on  Apache  Cassandra™  and designed for hybrid cloud.

    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large scale distributed systems every one patch McFadden I'm at the distributed data summit this is the distributing data show and with me today is my friend and everybody's favorite MVP Carlos Rolo hey little Carlos hello Rick so we have a lot to talk about today about upgrades now I'm gonna tell I'm gonna say why Carlos is the right guy to talk about here and he's gonna blush a little bit but there is no one in the world with more experience and the most hilarious stories about upgrading Cassandra clusters in the MVP Cassandra MVP community they call him the Cassandra archaeologist and why do we call you that well I think to get old stuff on old versions on my end you do and that's what I mean that's one of the things about Cassandra is if people will have a use case they'll deploy it and they forget about it for years and years and years yeah that's that's really good about the families it just went right but I so and people thing to forget about it and then you have a dinosaur so and you've had some pretty ancient dinosaurs yeah really really ancient dinosaurs 1.0 1.1 1.2 right and granted this is so Cassandra's coming up on 4.0 well just recently what's the the earliest cluster you've worked with recently the oldest one probably a 1.1 1.0 had not completely shut about it Wow and it was still working still working no we should well issues yeah but it's I mean it but it was running and it was working and somebody was making money from it I'm sure yeah probably heating a room somewhere so okay yeah a lot of dedicated artwork so since I mean it since I've got a blue shoe now is the expert in the whole world give me some tips like if someone's out here they're gonna they have an ancient cluster and probably a little worried like I don't want to upgrade this thing like give some reassurance what is it gonna take what do you what do you do the first thing is read the docs honestly go the readme can send the readme in the changelog because most of the traps clearly explicitly they're right so like you need to operate the dispersion between versions watch out of this setting when you upgrade so those things are mostly documented someone has already right add that problem the second one backup and restore yeah better that restore yeah always this your backup and the third one is especially with really old versions validate you feel that Ivers will work on the new version oh yeah that's right yes that would be a terrible thing to wake up to yeah so it's like yeah we have good and then out application doesn't work now when you do an upgrade especially with an older cluster do you do you take that data and try to do a test upgrade or at least some somewhat of a test yeah so the first thing is like because especially if the driver sing like spawn something on the side one on the cloud if you are on well figured out get the same SS tables out do inaudible older and get your application writing there reading there and make sure that least that discover no mandatory outside yeah especially if you want to make really big jumps in versioning right so one other thing is spreading from 1.2 to do dot 0 well it's mostly going to work but let's say you want to go all the way up to 311 - yeah that's going to take some work and some serious testing all right I mean they may not even know this but can you go from 1.2 to 3.11 in one shot no no no I'm gonna do that I think we just save some wines yeah yeah so tell me why not well sinking one to twelve network protocol changes oh yeah that's right yeah so you have to mandatory stop there I think in two dot if you make it up glad to to dr. something right you can skip a couple of steps and then go from to dr. something to me but I also must recommend out still ravioli yep great and another thing is these questions normally like I said a beginning around dedicated artwork crime so it's not like the cloud thing that you can spawn more machines and make it so right yelling back it's a pain if you could do sometimes yeah if you can't do all right so deep fried yourselves on doing online upgrades yeah we we try to make sure everything is an online app later then that's the thing people use Cassandra because they don't want to go offline right so if they don't want to go offline we should not go offline for the upgrades only plug your employer Pythian that's where you work you you it's funny because you get called in you you're the people you're the guy yeah it's called in to make sure I can go from this ancient version of the new version yeah without any downtime you exactly so we have actually a loan thank God I'm not alone you were for a long time yeah so never teaming actually think upgrades are a thing that we are doing it a lot so it's kind of right they would kind of in a management book manage the boat so and the newer versions make it everything really easier right so I hope there's nothing funky going on from Tila 311 to maybe not maybe not maybe not that it is something funky in 3.0 7 or 9 - with the SS cables no no there's another protocol like for the gossip oh gosh for me the gossip when you have to press the flag otherwise you get in there like I said it's in the release notes it's in the release time change log change log yeah it changed add text yes read those and the release notes that's always bookmarked on my is it yeah amazing just oh it's always go there why is it still there like it's enough good or maybe one of the million tabs on crown I do get a lot of ridicule for that and like how come you have so many tabs no I don't get lockup that to be honest but they get lot of browsers a lot of browsers okay I don't want to put you on the spot but do you have any hilarious stories probably I mean without naming names yes horror stories other stories yes so things that like now we are running SQL it's all test to the man it's dreams right on actor which is not updated for 40 years oh yes it's gonna be a big big change yeah and especially when they said now we have we are fully secured well don't worry about that and then it's like no we have a lot of left and a lot of drift and things don't work well yeah and then you migrate is as secure well and then well why is everything called key and value and so those of you who don't know you have been in the zener community for a long time cassandra started out with a different protocol called thrift and it was an RPC protocol and there were some drivers out there hector was one of those but the Cassandra community as a whole started moving towards cql Cassandra query language which we use now as a version 1.2 now that meant that there was a lot of legacy applications and we're hopefully we're starting to see the end of those because that was several years ago but you see a lot I shouldn't say no I don't see any but you see them all yeah and I'm sure that's a big shift because 4.0 is gone off yeah yeah that's a good thing yeah I like what was said today on the keynote like I like to understand how the storage work and I like trip because of that right but during the keynote I actually opened my first code for Cassandra I still have it oh it was stripped yeah okay and then I looked out the keys will build on I said no yeah not the way it should be done anymore I may have written a little thrift code in my day but it works right now it works and that given point storage was better which I feel that 3 3 . the relief within your attention yep but well it's like it's not the way to go anymore well I mean it's a fun fact so we're we're at the UC San Francisco Mission Bay facility the conference center we were all here for the Cassandra summit in 2010 and 2011 yeah yeah so this is kind of like our little home base first it's Andrew and there was a lot of thrift talks in 2010 there was only three of talks in 2010 and Nate was getting one of them Nate gave one of the toxin who gave the keynote today so yeah we come around back around again well alright so I think I think that should help people I hope yeah I hope it helps people any final words on upgrades like well I will do it say it again read the changes yeah it's a lot of them make sure you pick the right branch because some point it's truncated so you have to like dig down to if you really want to those things right and back up we well you should always have backups and then test your applications on the new versions make sure they work it's not yeah yeah it's something sometimes forgotten tester died yeah so weird settings new configuration settings always check those settings well Carlos thank you once again thank you follows you I'm really glad you made the trip over you know I really have to come see you yeah yeah I do I will thanks everyone we'll see you next time thanks everyone thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page on data Stax Academy and tell us what you think you can also find us on the data stacks Academy YouTube channel or find our podcast on itunes google play or wherever you get great podcast while you're there make sure and subscribe so you don't miss a single episode [Music]",
