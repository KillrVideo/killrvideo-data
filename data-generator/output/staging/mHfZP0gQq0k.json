    "text": "welcome everyone to Cassandra Ford I'm Patrick McFadden Apache Cassandra committer and longtime Community member if you're new to this community welcome if you've been around a while welcome back we are a truly Global community and that's great because anywhere you go in the world you can find other Cassandra people if you look at the registration data it looks like there is no hot spot and that's exactly what we want for a community it's not all just North America or Europe it's everywhere and that's great we're also seeing a lot of growth in Africa right now so if you're from Kenya Zimbabwe Cameroon Nigeria welcome we'd love to have you in our community so what's happening today consider this your Cassandra road map update Cassandra's been around a while and it's pretty established you probably use it every single day maybe you don't even know it and if you use it like as a part of your job then of course you use it but when you're using an application or website you're probably using Cassandra somewhere in that stack that's pretty cool so as a project we're not going to just sit back and declare code complete say okay we built a database and it's awesome moving on oh no no no no we asked ourselves a long time ago what do we do with the database that is highly performant in the largest use cases scales well beyond anything else I mean look around Cassandra is it when it comes to scale there is nothing bigger and truly active active replication around the world that is a hard problem and Cassandra solves it so well and no other database has quite done it the way that Cassandra does it and that's a pretty unique feature and finally one of the most important things it's a truly open source database that's Apache licensed freeze and beer free isn't Freedom you can do whatever you want with it it's not just free on my laptop until I put it into production and then I got to pay a license or I can only use it in certain use cases oh no you can do whatever you want with it and that's great so what do we do with the database like this we take it to the next level we move forward of course when I started using Cassandra quite a few years ago it was the database of the future it was a lot of early adopters who are willing to put in the time to figure it out that made it difficult for some people to use it actually a lot of people to use it but this is progress right we want this to be a database for everyone we want Cassandra to manage the hard things so you can go do the things that you need to do with your code building applications that actually do things and not have to worry about the database I had a professor used to say this a lot to me and I love it progress and technology is when we have the ability to be more lazy so great progress with Cassandra is when you can be super lazy about your database so what do we get out of this Cassandra for all it's time everyone should be able to use this database without any hassle a database that does what you need with few trade-offs because who wants trade-offs you just want to build your code and move on a database that is quick and easy to use on one hand but doesn't create a ton of tech debt on the other hand and there are some databases out there that do that I'm not naming names but you know who you are I've said it before this should be the database your kids use in the future and to do that we got to build it and where does that get built open source this is the place where it can happen Engineers are solving problems and sharing it in code and where do these Engineers work all over the place not just one company companies like Bloomberg Uber Netflix Apple data Stacks Engineers that are trying to solve that next thing because you know how it goes things always change but these are all companies solving tech problems for themselves and sharing it hence the open source this is where it has to happen and that's where it is happening and why we are a community of practitioners we're all building similar things and going in the same direction and that makes a really cool Community because we're all on the same page we all have the same kind of problems and we're solving it together that makes an awesome community so today we're going to see what's next what is out there in the future for Cassandra what problems those Engineers are actually solving the ones that I just talked about that are solving real problems what are they solving I think you'll be happy about that and what about the ecosystem around Cassandra data is about friends not one product does everything and you have to deploy things in teams and so when we look at the ecosystem around Cassandra Cassandra has some really great friends so let's talk about that that ecosystem of friends that make your applications so much cooler and finally what are those Leading Edge use cases that are emerging for Cassandra think about that we solved problems years ago that aren't the problems we have today but the database is still relevant for all those problems and new ones that are coming afterward head on over to the community mixer for some live q a some quizzes some prizes that's where I'm going to be this will all be done on zoom and that Zoom link should be in the chat and if you love this content how about two days of it that's the Cassandra Summit in December sign up today for the Cassandra Summit and show up in person in San Jose and you will be amazed there is so much we can share together and I hope to see you there sit back relax and enjoy two hours of awesome Cassandra content and thanks for joining us here at Cassandra forward oh wait one more thing so some of you might remember back in the day there was this website called Planet Cassandra well it's back we're gonna bring it back as an awesome community resource for Cassandra users plan a cassandra.org so when you're there see if there's anything you can help us with because as a community we love our sharing and help us build this together sharing is very important part of our community and we hope that you do that too okay now we can get to Cassandra Ford thanks for joining us today",
