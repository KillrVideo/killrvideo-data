    "text": "great hello hi david hello alex how you doing yeah it's a great day i love mondays and how is everybody mondays it's learning mondays learning fun days well uh well well well so i see people are joining our stream if you can hear us and if you can see us say something about that in the youtube chat you may write from where are you from it's always very interesting how people from all across the world are joining us that's gorgeous okay hello guys and it looks like we are good and it looks like we are fine so i suggest us to start step by step yeah that's what's funny in the chat like finland amsterdam sweden and we got people from everywhere you know it's i have to have to say and i just typed this in there it's kind of a fun stupid fact um but uh for santosh and there from finland we have we have some close finished friends so both my daughters have finish in their names uh one is uh lachia which is gift and the other one is uh lumi uh which is snow so they have i mean they have other names but they happen to finish in their names what do you know you never know that's incredible how world works in 21st century i really like it yeah yeah totally okay so as you maybe know or at least you should that's data stocks mandel learning the special program when we are trying to make your monday your favorite day of the week with monday learning and we every week run courses and different workshops for the topics what will make your developers hard hot and this uh is this fourth release of our docker containers from basics to best practice scores it was four weeks learning path but now it's five weeks thanks to you because together you persuaded our bosses what you need kubernetes and we are giving kubernetes now as a week five so it could have been end for this course but it's not because we will meet again next week to talk about how kubernetes works and regarding the things we did before we did docker fundamentals we did application development with docker and today we speak about the best practices so stick to us and follow this workshop and do one more now with introduction to kubernetes and get your final assignment to get your docker upgrade complete achievement and we are getting further so this course was in a high demand really a lot of registrations and by today it was like round over then 2 300 hours of overall watch time and it always makes us happy to see how you stay with us and i hope you spend even more time doing your homework assignment it's very important to keep up with a job like you can listen to me and david 1 000 times but if you don't do exercises on your own it will not stick to your memory so good so you you will become a real expert so you have to use that not only watch that best practices so before we go with the best practices let's say a word of about what we are going to talk about today first of all this class isn't going to be easy because we have to cover pretty a lot of things so docker ecosystem and the amount of things to do that's a long long story and there are many places to make mistakes so and there are many um best practices to enforce and today is the overview of them so try to get as much uh as you can from this show do the assignment and then you can make a deeper dive into something what looks the most important to you but best practices isn't about to make your projects running because well that's just base practices and we speak about the best practices what are they about that's about maintainability worst enemy of any software complex application any complex system is the complexity more complex more complexities that's harder to maintain and we have to fight this complexity otherwise at some point we will not be able to bring any changes anymore and manage the system we are developing so best practices help you to ensure the maintainability of the project you are working on then of course security security is not the goal which you are kind of trying to reach somewhere in the end but security is the way uh is a way to put very important uh from the very first moment not like you are developing something and you start to think okay now let's redevelop at it now let's protect it that's wrong and that's very prone to any failures and exploits and so on you want to think from the security from the very very very first step we will speak about that today as well and finally aurora prevention that's that best practices are very often a great way to catch auroras even before they happen or at least even before they sneak into your production so that's other things we are going to take care of today and we start with a simple thing size doesn't matter at least when we speak about uh docker images and we want our images to be very fit we want our images to be like david what was the biggest docker image you've ever seen or use it oh jeez many many yeah yeah yeah yeah right yes and lightweight images are much easier to operate and much easier to start imagine you have your production server down is on fire and you want to spawn a new one and you are on the cloud so it's kind of pretty easy you spawn a new server you are going to start your application there and the image weight is around like five gigabytes and it will be pull that uh for approximately a couple of ages and only when it will be starting and if you have image of five gigabytes of weight it's going to be starting nearly forever mostly problem so um what we think of first we want our containers to be fit our images to be fit and therefore we really think a lot of lightweight images they're much easier to operate and the first thing the work on is the use minimal possible beige image base image slim alpine scratch those words may say nothing to you but i will show you to it not actually right now why wait some people underestimate the importance of the base image but base image defines well donkey's cheap show me the code let's take a look so i will make us a little bit smaller so you will see all the code boom david we are small again no yeah look at that yes so that's the first sample from today's week and it looks by itself not so bad and it works so what is it it's a containerized python application very small one application looks like that it's based on flask a very small miniature framework for python and all the application of application code is here five lines import flask and return hello world kinda that's all what you have to do it's a hello world application and when we have requirements uh where we define what do we need to uh run this application and flask only so again only one dependency and that's all the docker files so three files from python37 copy files set working directory install requirements and then cmd what are we going to run when we start a container does it look nice to you how do you think how does it look nice to you david looks pretty clean yeah looks pretty clean so let's build that and i'm saying docker build i will set tech to make it easy for us i will say it data stacks monday learning first like this and i will build it here locally at oh stop stop stop stop of course i have to switch to my folder so it's going to be first sample and now i build it i really appreciate the time you spend with us so i of course build it beforehand to save some of your time so now it's done all completely using cache usually takes a bit longer because we have to download base image base image we are using python 37 and now let's take a look i say docker run i have to firebar the port it will be port 80 on my side port 5000 at the docker side and basically that's all what i need i need a dml first and our port is already allocated okay sorry i forgot to stop for all advantages but that doesn't matter oh that's right i'm blocking some of the text by the way uh yeah uh sorry i will uh move it a little bit so you will not block that thank you david stop blocking my text what are you doing okay so well we know that my chair is actually where uh my chair is transparent in the back so i can just move of the way okay so good we have this application running and just to check that we can go to localhost localhost open port 8080 report i forwarded it and we see applications here so we have this hello world loud and clear and everything is fine okay so it works now let's take a look at the thing it works but is there something what could have been done better let me say docker images and i am going to grab dml first to show you i you know what i will hide this explorer so you yeah now everything is fine i just ducked out of the way yeah thank you so take a look at those nice numbers 885 megabytes almost one gigabyte for what for five lines of python code you know i wondered alex when you asked me earlier how it looked if when i thought that there was going to be a little trick in there of this image is going to be like huge and i don't think i was wrong yeah yeah that's almost one gigabyte for five lines of python code again all the application looks like that that's like not the best scenario let's say let's take a look if we could do it better so first of all i want to kill or i want to kill old containers okay i'm not going to use them first go 384 go e boom okay i'm clean good so let's try to take a look if we could do it better and i'm going i bet i'm going to make it already much better with five characters only with 5 characters it will be already much better so let's take a look it will be python 3.7 slim i will explain you what does that mean in a moment don't be in a hurry but now i'm building this image again and it will be dmail first slim it again will be pretty quick uh okay not so clear cache invalidation button it's not a long story to install flask so it's done now i can run that so i have these this one and it will be slim now alex if you go to run that uh vikrant over on youtube has a really really good question here is there a way to identify such issues with dockerfile like a tool or something say you can use python you know and then it would almost like a linter for size right where you could use python slim for better size management there's some tools for the best tool for vet is your brain and that's kind of a joke but also no joke as well so we are setting up this tool to work with this kind of things so you will know what's the base what's the slim and what's the alpine so you will see and you will use that and you will define how to use that and which kind of image you need at each moment so it sounds like what i just heard is you just have to be aware that this is a thing right and and to specifically go out and look for okay i want to use python is there a slim version or something of it uh so vera linters indeed and we will cover them today but i'm not sure if linter can define if you are using like a regular image but you could have been good with slim as well i'm not sure if there is a linter to define that so okay we can go to localhost this time it will be simply port 18 because i cleaned it up and we are good again so application is running we see it unlocks everything is fine i'm quitting and now let's take a look i'm doing the same docker images grab the email first oh wow look at the difference there the difference is that's a huge it looks better that looks significantly better but do you think if i can make it better in some more characters you know them i think the answer is yes i have a feeling i have a feeling the answer is yes by the way um jeffrey has a follow-up here so there would would there ever be a use case for just using python 3.7 would you always use the slim versions like what are you getting for out of that extra 700 megabytes worth of uh worth it yeah let me show you this one and i will answer uh so and final example would be let me make this python37 alpine and i will answer this question because it's a good question which definitely deserves to be answered and i'm having i'm building alpine image it's also done because i prepared that for you and now we can run that using alpine version and it's going to be running so i can renew it again and we are good again so here are my locks it all working i'm going to stop that and now let's find the difference docker images grab the email first and alpine version is 52 megabytes so just by changing just by adding some characters here in the base image and the tag of the base image we got from 885 megabytes to 121 megabytes to 52.3 megabytes isn't that great i like it now our image is 50 megabytes so it will fit into only 10 discards 3.5 inch well i hope you are not using those discounts anymore at least i don't and that's but what happened here so let's think a little bit uh we have python and what is this python python is an official python image built by python team and store it at hub the docker.com you know that already from our previous classes then what happens after this double point all what happens after the double points call it tech and tech is in basically any string you want to give it's just it can be some random characters but of course we want it to be something more reasonable so what is that 3.7 obviously says the python version version of an interpreter we are going to have inside and then what is this alpine then let's think so every image has some base image in the beginning for python that's mostly probably going to be debian we can jump down and take a look but that's not so important for us anyway um if we have this python 3.7 which kind the default image it's a full-size linux system with pretty a lot of dependencies install it full featured system it's maybe good for development because you have all the required tools you may want to have there all the python modules you want to have them but obviously it's also not so good for production where you aren't going to use them so much and then for slim version you have the same base distribution usually but they there are some things cut off and there are removed some options and it may be already operational it works as you've seen but it's also different it's a reduced size and finally when we say alpine it's already completely different think that's absolutely another linux distribution which is also linux so called alpine linux we can go where uh that's open source as always so we can go for github for alpine and we have here alpine linux just a tiny linux distribution and we have of course alpine docker here docker alpine which is the smallest possible uh docker image which is still kinda linux so maybe there are some uh smaller things but i alpine is one of the most popular for example if we say uh docker images grab alpine the size will be five megabytes so that's exact that's the default alpine has inside that comes with the price of course there is always a price to pay this alpine has obviously due to this size nearly everything what can be removed remove it as a result for example when you are doing david when you are doing docker exec dash i.t container name bash what will happen expect to go to a bash pump inside of a container uh yeah um or i can actually uh if normal container not slim not alpine you will mostly probably go to bash inside the container if at all i mean if it has bash in general with alpine you will get an error because there is no bash install it because bash is too big for alpine and yeah and you will get to sh because you can get only two sh because sage alpine is the smallest possible shell for it and so on and so forth so in general for production um for many applications we try to stick to alpine sometimes it's very hard to implement your application using alpine because well that's a special story there will be no upgrade but apk how do you say it in english doesn't matter and that's a long story in some cases you will be not able to make your application running with alpine at all and you should not by itself make it your holy grail but that's important to remember what size does matter and we want uh we would like to have our images small as small as possible then second interesting thing is a multi-stage build but i have special slide for that so i will show it to you later multi-stage is my favorite feature or more or less new features of docker so i want to show it of course then i want my pointer yep so uh you know docker file copy copy is the way to copy your files from local folder to the image and we have to use copy carefully and we have to copy only what we need the point is when you are copying the wall local folder the wall local folder will go to image and if you are working in the folder with git or gita dot git store it somewhere inside then mostly probably you are going to have dot git in your image and that's again mostly probably not what you are going to have another point what it destroys caching if you copy everything and one single bit and one single file has changed then docker has to invalidate the cache and build everything from scratch and considering some layers below some statements below it may take a long time so in general when you are using copy there are two main ways or you copying specifying only the files you exactly want to copy copy this and that but it may be like also not the best way especially if you have a lot of files second file second way which i like the most is the docker ignore when you are using a docker ignore you can go like in our second sample you can copy everything so okay in this case we are copying requirements okay in the first sample we copy everything and we have only three files here which is not so bad but if you want to stay safe even from the future files which may happen here you can easily define dot docker ignore docker ignore okay looks correct to me and you can specify what should be ignored by docker copy so it can be for example if you want to avoid git it can be dot git and that's it git folder is ignored but you know what there can be git in other folders of yours and if you want to stay safe you better do it like that asterisk asterisk slash this directive looks like looks a little bit weird but if you use git ignore you know what that means it means file or folder go dot git in the current or any uh folders down recursive and that's uh yes that's something like git ignore exactly but for docker so you can copy things but everything specified in docker ignore will never go to docker image then install and clean up in one step i will show you it's impossible to explain without the docker file clock is cheap show me the code and final one will be um wait watch numbers of layers in most cases less is better beforehand and still there are a lot of people who think it is like that still they are wrong before nearly every of the docker dockerfile statements added a new layer now it's not like that it was fixed and now there are only three commands those add new layers run copy add all the other commands do not add new layers and that's important to understand i will show you like i got a question for you yeah i hear from uh in um in youtube is the docker is is there a docker ignore global like the one forget ignore so that's a good question i agree yeah last time um last time i've tried to use that it wasn't a thing it never existed maybe now it's a thing but i i can't answer right now so maybe david maybe you can take a look at the docs while i'm answering other questions so um uh question was uh so there would never be a use case for just python37 we always use the slim versions from japanese inc you see it heavily depends on your system and which libraries you are using for example by itself node.js application doesn't have so many requirements but for one of our use cases with killer video we needed to specially compile it and we needed to install all of our dependencies we needed make we needed g plus plus and so on so it was a pretty big installment and a lot of dependencies so i don't know what dependencies your project has but in general we tend to use as small base images as possible always there still could be a place for a full image especially um when we speak about some development environment you may want to have it because it gives some extra tools to you which will not be a thing with alpine for example yep and yeah i think we can go on and finally run up install needs version for caching and stability team what does that mean let me show you uh for example in the second example we run opt get install we get as it well first of all this is a bad example people started to ask me like it could have been done better i know that second sample is exactly to improve this one not to uh show it as a how it should be but what i'm talking about right now is to specify the version here i don't know what's the last up to date we get version i will put it like that what does that mean there are two points first when you don't stick to major version you are going to install next one like 13 it's not a real vgat13 but let's imagine and it may have some breaking changes so your docker build will not be operational after all or maybe even you will find it out on production so first thing it may break your application completely on build time or even on runtime which is worse second point when you have it like that that's easier to cache and once it's downloaded if nothing is broken upstairs so there is no caching validation it will be just reuse it from cache and with some random we get it may be updated cache is broken and then we have to do all of these operations again from scratch what we would like to avoid good uh so finally now let's get closer ah and finally yes utilize cache that was exactly i was talking about right now uh copy as late as possible as specific as possible put less frequently changed lines higher so we don't break cache what does that mean let's take a look at these code on the from the first sample we co-appear as the second statement first one from and when we immediately copy him will it work yes it will is it optimal no it doesn't especially without docker ignore it definitely doesn't the point is docker utilizes cash heavily as long as you allow him to and when he on a copy statement there is only one way to calculate if cash can be reused or has to be invalidated basically get every of your files get the hash and compare with the hashed value from the hash from the cache and it's fine as long as i have like three five files here it's not so big job but you are mostly probably going to have much more and therefore this is just this process as it is going to take some time but then second one as soon as one single beat in one single file has changed now the wall cache has to be wiped out and all the next layer sketch has to be invalidated as well so one single point in a single file at this level and all the bill all the layers has to be recalculated and rebuilt again and in some cases it may takes hours not on this one but i know some applications with build time over an hour so what we want to have here use copy as late as possible as specific as possible if i know i'm going to use only up pi then why shouldn't i do it like that oops dot is the wrong one here so things like that that's at first okay i will need requirements as well but um that's not so important second try to use in statements those attempt to change more often as low as possible directly low in this file lower down or down so take a look i have my line 5 as a cmd what is a cmd cmd is a statement which will be executed when on build time or runtime on runtime as the first action when i start the container it's not executed on build time question can i move it higher answer is yes so i can sort of put it here and boom this line is cached already um and worked here i can set work deer higher as well i can set work deer here i cannot move this line higher because i need file requirements.txt in my up folder because i need that to define dependencies but i definitely can make it like that and as a result i have those three lines cached nearly forever and only copy will change and pip install requirements txt will change which i can optimize even better from the build time now take a look simplicity is very often an enemy of performance now this makes docker file much smaller so it's easier to read and come in simplicity is great but the build time if i want to improve build time how would i do that let me show you this copy as you're developing application will break files will break dependencies will break cache nearly over time and cache will be invalidated it means to pip install every docker build which is not nice so what i want to do i want to do a nice trick that's a nice hug i like it a lot i'm doing requirements dot txt steam i am putting it to up requirements extreme and i do pip install now and of the afterwards i'm copying the source code and what happened now and why do i think it will work better the point is as i copy on the line 4 only requirements.txt file it will not change too often it will not change every time you put any changes into the application only when you add some new dependencies or remove them vice versa so this file will not be changed too often as a result this uh layer this run executions this run peep install will be cached and will not be invalidated because all of those lines don't tend to change too often or maybe don't tend to change at all and as a result only copy statement will be invalidated regularly but copy is a pretty quick operation that's it we just improved the build performance build time decreased build time by the price of readability by the price of adding some new copy statement question does it matter is it the best practice or is not so best not so good practice it depends on your goals if you want if your build time is the most important for you do it to save build time if you prefer to have things as simple as possible easier to read for the human human time is more important kind of at computer time then you can remove it completely and keep the things like that and there is no single correct answer but that's for you to decide how you want to see that so alex i got a question for you on that show um in the in the example you just gave when you were explicitly copying over the requirements text first then later on when you're copying with dot right you're just going to pull everything i would think including the requirements text but is it because it's are you actually then recopying that or because it's now cached it kind of ignores it or something what's going on copying and it it will be you are recovering it will be copying again but as it's a single small file with one two three five ten twenty lines at maximum i mean come on how many of the dependencies you are going to have in the requirements it's not that big deal there yeah so that's not a problem but i mean some micro seconds i don't care so uh jeffrey by the way has a follow-up there wouldn't that first copy add another layer we wanted layers to be less i thought yes we want yes copy adds a layer but what is a layer a layer first of all is a change set we will cover it exactly on the next slide so we try to have as small layers as possible but that's again not a holy grail in the end we do all those things for you developers to be more convenient to develop an application and if you have to wait for three hours for docker build that's obviously the wrong thing but as it is one single layer is not so bad by itself so i mean what i don't want to see is 200 layers 300 layers but one more layer by the price of i mean uh how much uh this pip install took uh we didn't just um i mean some minutes ago it took like five seconds but this layer will also be very small so i save it five seconds on every build i do almost every build by the price and i've seen pip installs that take a lot longer than five seconds for sure so of course without making that optimization you're paying that every single time you rebuild this yep yeah correct okay so and then second point was so put less frequently changed lines higher so we don't break cash copy as late as possible as specific as possible they actually are for the same purpose utilize cash as heavy as possible then enough of weight training exercises redundant layers and now uh as said before every run copy and add will create a new layer first example create two layers while second only one so we see here we have run upgrade update second run update install nginx will it work yes it will it makes one redundant layer we mostly probably don't want to have uh then second example does them both in single run statement which brings you one single layer of the same size um but well not exactly on the same size it will be smaller than this combination um together and well that's a pretty good practice to combine run operations together i will show you there are some tweaks later how to do that then redundant files we try to remove all build time dependencies so don't forget there is a build time when we do docker build and there is a run time when we do docker run and there can be a huge time gap between those two or maybe a run time may never happen it also may be a thing so uh what's the difference between first example and second example and why i say second is better and first is worse they do exactly the same thing if you read that line by line they will do exactly the same thing they do update update update install package i need for build they built my application let's say maven install if you are stick to maven then we get some cleanup work so we get how to remove we remove build package we do a cleanup and we clean up up lists to remove repositories from a local file so does it look like a good job at first maybe because we are doing all the cleanup steps so that's great we use it so maven let's say we built out image but when we remove it maven and everything we got during update update which is pretty heavy operation we remove it during the uh last statement so why it's wrong answer is don't forget layer is basically a change set like commit in gita like committing git says those lines were added those lines were removed if you do all those operations in the learn different run statements every run statement technically if you make a deeper dive creates an intermediate container from the previous layer executes the statements and then commits this container to a new image and as a result first we will have three different images here a few different layers i don't care about intermediate containers they are ephemeral but we will have three different images here and moreover everything what we installed here we will have here again so we haven't cleaned it up but basically increased it twice because we have layer here and layer here and layer here first plus then minus and all together it works like two pluses because we have a diff we have a change set stored and these alex we have a oh i'm sorry alex we have a question that addresses this directly uh from vitrent over on youtube do we remove layers to reduce the build time like we get intermediate docker image uh is each run commit to new images is this true we remove images mostly for transfer time i would say uh so that's um those operations are pretty quick so you may have 100 of empty layers or almost empty layers adding one bit uh it will not be a long time for docker to walk through all of them in comparison with one update update which in some cases with some custom repositories may take five minutes let's say under some circumstances and as a result uh those layers are mostly optimization for transfer time not for build time so as a result we have here exactly all the same operations but executed with one single run statement what does that mean at this here before run we create an intermediate container from the previous layer so in our case it will be plain debian 9. in this container we do all the job update install build cleanup and when after that we commit this image to be a next layer and cleanup has been finished already and that means what only new thing here is all the consequences of build my app so for example let's say a new jar file but everything what was delivered with update update has been removed already and as a result it doesn't fit in term uh diff it doesn't get into the docker commit and that's exactly like between commits in your git repo you can put whatever 10 gigabytes of videos of your family celebration but if you delete them before docker before git commit they will not get there that's exactly the same i mean that's exactly the same yeah that's a good way to do it good now sweet one multi-stage builds multi-stage builds that's incredible that's something new uh well not so new new but yeah it helps really a lot multi-stage builds allow you to use different base images at the different uh build steps of your docker file you have here an example and that's not two docker files that's a single docker file with two from directives what's the trick uh usually your build time dependencies are much wider than your runtime dependencies especially when we speak about statically compiled files those have all the dependencies you may need inside them uh in this case we work with an example of a golang and in the beginning in the first line we say from golang 1.10 as builder nothing notice there are no dash slim no dash alpine or whatever we don't need that let's take a look why the soviets go long image may be pretty big i don't care first we set working directory second we copy source code to this directory and finally we do run go build command and we put everything to output file named hello so just file name and we compile it statically so it will have all its dependencies inside and here magic happens because now we do from scratch what does that mean you know from but how can we have to from in one docker file that's easy we just switch the base image we work it in golang 110 and now boom you work from scratch second question is what's the hell that scratch is about you never mentioned that it's the kind of an application answer is no scratch is nothing scratch is zero scratch is empty and endless not endless null scratch is literally an empty image and when i say empty i mean empty that's kinda even more lightweight than alpine and it was hard let's say but yes it's done then we have this cmd this container as a can will execute uh slash hello command so the file we just compile it when it will be started and finally we use copy directive but specifying from from builder and this builder is the previous base image we use it and we copy file from tmp go hello to slash hello and our image will be based on scratch and has basically only one layer due to this copy and that's incredible and that's the most lightweight uh container even possible statical um statically linked bills of course are big by themselves so this go file um statically linked will be more let's say will be bigger when not statically linked and the same for java files for example or whatever c plus a c plus plus you are using but as a final result as we basically cut off uh the wall operating system and put everything into executable file it will be smaller and that's great i like multi-stage builds that's incredible feature i wanted to have i should have uh i should have have them uh like five years ago i was they were in i need it's very sad we didn't have them those times labels so what is a label in the docker file you may have a label statement which allows you to set label and that's a very cool feature which allow you to set metadata for your images take a look at the second sample here we have maintainer specified and as you see it's corrosive maintainer is deprecated maintainer has been deprecated and you recommended to use label and we can completely replace it with label and actually we may have as much labels as we want to have and label maintainer will be maintainer name itinerary mail but actually i may have as much labels as i want to i can proceed right here k2 uh equals value 2 or i can have a second line it doesn't matter because labels don't create new layers after all and that can be things like that so they're not wasteful quite the same way as layers are yeah but they don't create layers and they set metadata for the image you are building and by the way alex we do have a follow-up on the previous uh question from our previous section from vikrant so in this that hello.go will not be existing in our image right uh so in this hello go will not be existing in our image right i mean only executable hello will be available on image not for code yes exactly exactly so as a final result we have this new um image and it will has we are copying only one file we can copy more files if you if you want to but here we have via copy you remember copy as specific as possible so in this case we are copying only one file so we will have just one file nothing more yes so it sounds like if you have something that's executable if you're creating something that's executable then the optimization is to use a multi-stage build and generate whatever is executable and then in the second stage of the multi-stage build just use that to access the thing and you're essentially discarding all of this all the artifacts you needed to build the thing in the first place with yep and finally which labels you should consider i always recommend to set a git repository this project belongs to as a label doesn't matter if it's a proprietary project and you work with your team or multiple teams on the same project it will help you or if you work especially if you work on the open source project that's also very important always specify a maintainer or better a team because well maintainer may change team usually doesn't or at least rarely then build number or better even link if you build for example with jenkins or gitlab it's always great to include a direct link to a build so you can watch for logs if you want to check something how it was built exactly when bill date always makes sense git commit hash always makes sense and there are many more things you would like maybe to include into the labels that's usually makes sense what's it all about it's about to stay traceable that's about to um help people and yourself after some months you will forget everything help yourself to understand what's going on here what this image is about stay traceable oh now that's a sweet one bit one problem okay so bit one problem is a big deal you definitely need to know um david uh did it happen to you what uh you are running some docker cam docker container with docker run without detaching that so like it's attached to your terminal and at some point uh if you are done and you want to quit and you press ctrl c and nothing happens yeah sure many times yeah bit one problem [Music] so that all comes from linux docker was built originally on linux containers alex sim and that all comes from linux the point is in linux systems the process which is running first so process id 1 or init process or p1 process has some has some additional responsibilities well every system has its own responsibilities we use whatsapp to send messages or whatever i prefer telegram and that's the purpose of a messenger to send messages and every process has its purposes but p1 process has extra responsibilities and those are as following reap zombies pass back exit codes pass through system signals what does that all mean first of all rips zombies what are the zombies uh there are no exactly the zombies what will hunt for your brain but we will hunt for your cpu and random access memory definitely those are computer zombies after all and the zombies are processes um which are sub processes those main process for example fail it or quit somehow or don't wait for them and sub sub processors are in the endless loop or anything or wait for the main process to accept the results which will never accept them anyhow those are forgotten processes usually that's their responsibility of the main process who spawn at them to reap them as they don't need it anymore but if the main process for spawn networm is not available anymore we will be automatically attached to p1 process linux and if p1 process is not ready to reap zombies you will have zombies forever as long as container is running uh to clean it up and to avoid memory leaks your p1 process must be ready to handle zombies to reap zombies know what we exist and be ready to kill them as soon as they are not needed anymore first thing second thing imagine you have a container of few processes running it happens all the time like nginx may have some workers uh or i don't know apache web server is going to have some process and so on if one of the processes exited uh with error code with exit code non-zero exit code it means sort you have a mistake exit code is not zero but one two three like whatever then basically it means what your application failed what something is wrong when you have to be notified you would like to know if something goes wrong but if bit one process is not configured properly and doesn't know about this responsibility even if it's this process attracts subprocesses even if this process will exit as well because subroutes has failed very often it will exit with exit code 0 and when you have a word situation something went wrong wrong your container exited but it exited with exit code zero which means in linux world hey everything is fine we are done i finished my job what do you mean you finished your job you haven't finished your job why did you quit i don't know we are all fine so very important for vp1 process is to pass back exit codes if one of the subprocesses exited with exit code 10 whatever that means then bit one should exit bad best case with the same exit code or at least with exit code one okay something went wrong take a look at that master and then finally system signals forwarding and that's exactly the point we mentioned it before v of david then uh you want to close your application in docker docker run and you push ctrl c and nothing happens it means what p1 process doesn't pass through signals or doesn't process signals it has to process signals at first and second forward them to all subprocesses and the problem is most container entry point processes python java even bash do not fulfill the p1 process responsibilities properly and when we run into a lot of rare situations okay how to fix that fix before and fix now are two completely different things uh fixed before was to uh launch your programs properly have special scripts have special treatments have a lot of things to do uh docker run install um some process manager and so on and now that's i really excited how we solve it because now it's solved with just six characters on docker run seriously let me show you something so we have had those first sample applications like very very simple flask application python application running let me make it a little bit clearer and i will do a little job here at first i will docker run dml first alpi alpine just as it is oops i want to run it in detached mode so i will show it to you boom yep it's running and second i'm running it again i need to use another port because 80 is busy and now i'm adding dash dash in need that's all i add in general they absolutely are identical they're different only in report which is not uh which doesn't matter right now and this dash in it boom if we say docker ps i guess you know what's going on we have those two processes running right here now let's take and they looks completely identical except of id and name but let me show you now something if we go to first one uh so i'm going to do docker exec i'm going oh that's alpine ah i launch it with wrong containers i'm sorry uh if they as it's that's one of the problems by the way that's even a good example i wanted to do ps oaks to show you the processes but i cannot do that because that's alpine there is no ps at the by default so i have to install it so i will kill the storm and i will run uh just first and i will uh rod run again first so i will have ps outs there oh that was a trick good so now what i'm doing i'm going to the docker exec for the one which runs uh the vout init command and it was the second one when you used one so it will be 5 a e beam oops and i what i want to see is i want to see ps aux so i'm executing if you are far away from linux it may be a little bit not so obvious for you but here i'm saying docker exec to execute a command inside the container which container to use this one five ieb74 blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and which exact comment to execute i need ps house to save a process list and that's what i have i have my flask running my python running here and i have bsox and who has the pid 0 notice this pid process id 0 my python and that's maybe not best in some cases because python is not a process manager as it is you may implement all this functionality in your own application but you have to implement that otherwise signals will not be processed and so on and now i'm doing the same but to take a look and that another container what was its name 984 okay 984 go and pitcher is the different although the absolutely exact same base image we're using so i still have psoax because i'm executing this command so it fits into that i still have this python running but this time python has pid 6 and what's going on who is my hero here with pid1 it's as bin docker init this file was automatically injected to his container by docker to help me to run flask and that's so-called teeny process manager or tatini init process which does all the job i tell him to do so all them dependencies we have here we've always been one process responsibilities and it's doing them well what is teeny you may ask answer is simple where is the project uh pretty well known like 5 000 stars uh on github and that's as it's very well said here teeny tiny but valid in need for containers it's exactly the speed one process nothing more it will pass through signals it will pass back exit codes it will exit as soon as the child processes that and reap zombies if they are any congrats and all by the price of one single dash dash in it command isn't that beautiful yeah so i think i what i'm hearing though is that if you're going to then run use it use docker run or whatever that you should just use by default dash dash init is part of your process um well not necessarily i mean it depends on what exactly depends what you're doing uh you see that depends on what exactly you are doing in some cases i need one and one only process it will never have any sub processes it will process signals and there will be no zombies as i run no sub processes in this case i don't need yeah so there are different use cases uh but yeah that's just important to understand what all times where you needed to install something in order to handle p1 problem uh they are not the thing anymore it's done good so no we aren't always running it but in some cases it really helps well there is one other follow-up to that by the way um vikram was asking so this init is it a kind of service manager uh yes it's kinda service manager well manager is a big word because a teeny is a tiny it doesn't manage as it is it's like okay uh child processes that i will die too boom done uh if there are any sub-processes reattached reap them if your signal has come pass it through and like that's not really a manager that's very neat process well done tiny in each process we will work with process managers in a moment don't run in front of the train we will cover that and then arthur asks is it possible to use dash dash in it with docker compose oh well actually i never did that before so i think there should be a way but i didn't do it let's take a look um compose i cannot find anything in their maid main documentation regarding um docker compose but that doesn't mean i only can ask you to take a look because yeah i don't know never took a chance to take a look at that okay well then we are moving on multi-process containers so if you watch for docker best practices in the internet you would mostly probably find something like that one container one responsibility one process as a general rule it's a good general rule i recommend to stick to but what i'm doing here what i prefer to do here is to add one more step or one more consideration i prefer to think not on the one process but on the one service for example it may be a real overkill to have in one single container nginx php fpm mysql and memcache if you are doing things like that then mostly probably uh you are going to need docker compose and four different services but so i mean small services not service like facebook but service like database or service like i don't know radius but in some cases it may be a good solution why take a look if you handle this stack i've just mentioned nginx php fpm mysql and memcache for example you handle only four containers for services and it's really easy to keep them together in docker compose but if you handle the big system with hundreds of services with a dozen of databases over multiple servers you may want to simplify things for you for yourself and in php fpm for example is the thing which doesn't serve on the normal port but that's more of the sockets usually we have and that's not kinda so http based at let's say we always prefer to have um reverse proxy we always prefer to have proxy server in front of php fpm that's easier to explain like that and if we have these nginx and php php fpm working together as a result we have one container with one port opened ready to serve your all http queries so that's important to understand what sometimes we do want to have multi-process containers okay then then are there any issues yes yes there are some issues that's not simply that's not simple to run multiple processes in the containers you need a manager do you remember p1 process now it's even worse and we have more things to do so that's not only now a thing to pass through the things that's not only if let's also think to manage them to spawn them and to understand their state so manager thinks manager works is higher here on the right side you see a bad example so we have two processes running in parallel like let's say nginx with childs and fpm with childs and they are not managed anyhow and if bank beats let's say fpm is dead here what will happen nginx is running is this container useful anymore no way it cannot execute any kind of a statement but it will be running because well we have engine x bit one process is running it can nothing but who cares and in this case we have parent process which is supposed to be a manager so it will take care of a child process quits if they are dead and so on and so forth or maybe restart them which is a bad practice okay then so we need a multi-process in need we need to run multiple child process but we don't restart them we prefer to quit if one of them is dead here is a trick a lot of people may say okay super wizard super wizard will restart my process if it's broken so that's completely fine why do i why do you say what do not restart them answer is simple the point is we may have multiple points or multiple layers of management and control over the application so we have if we have super wizard install it and restarting your processes that's fine but you may have one more layer of docker and docker restarting your process or we may have one more layer of kubernetes or dukker's worm restarting your containers or pots then how exactly you are going to manage the system if you have so many levels with different changes in them that's not convenient thing so in general we always recommend roxas was that don't restart that quit call a daddy and ask him uh to fix this thing or whatever who takes care of your system quit with exit code so do not restart them second one exit a suit child process terminates and still fulfill all p1 process responsibilities and in the beginning it looks like we have a lot of innate processes different options i mean but as you start to get deeper into the list you start to strike them over like um strike out you aren't going to use them so first of all we have a lot of full size linux things like systemv like upstart and many others they are too big they are too linux specific they are bad feed for a container especially when we are trying to keep them smaller let's take a look later super wizard use it very often i do not recommend to use that first of all it requires a full-size python environment to run as it's a python application if you're running python application it may be fine but if you are running java it's going to be stupid to have java virtual machine and pirate python world at the same container at the same time other than that supervisor tends to restart containers by default and maybe to peek from my point of view then run it and want it different projects but i say it again like that uh too big uh full size and like do many other jobs we don't want to be done for container we don't need so much teeny tiny looks great but that's not a multi-process manager it's a simple p1 process nothing more it's tiny that's what we like but if you want to run multiple containers that's a no-go for you and when finally uh we are having s6 and s6 as a special thing which was done uh from linux developers to linux developers you will understand that reading documentation and that's like not a really good recommendation but so far it's one of the best process managers we want to have for multi-process systems and there is a couple of things to mention about that like what i do want you well s6 website as it is looks like that no cheating it really looks like that yeah i told you from linux engineers to linux engineers and there is a one them dozen of different multiple dozens of different programs you may need because they realistic to linux approach uh one process one purpose but there is something better you may like more uh which is called the receipt there is it where is it give me a moment s6 overlay this one is the place to go if you want to have multiple processes for containers it's a s6 process manager overlay which allows you to run multiple processes at once and handling them properly and notice in my last phrases we never say to word things like easy simple uh nothing like that because well there is nothing like that i'm saying about how to handle multi-process containers properly as a result can you run multi-process containers yes you can can you do them properly covering all the signals forwarding and all the other things and process management yes you can do you want to do it no you don't so still try to stick to one process one purpose approach it looks not nice but it works it's easier to configure in the most of the cases any questions yeah as a matter of fact um so as an example talking about um the single process multi-process piece is a cassandra node cluster would that be considered in one container would that be considered um a container with one responsibility or one service uh so uh cassandra note cassandra cluster note is kind of course one uh so one purpose because well it provides the cassandra port open and you can do all the sql operations you want to do with but it's also not a single process container for example when we speak about everything of cassandra and kubernetes you are always going to have um cassandra as it is but also a sidecar running alongside sidecar is a management process for cassandra so you already have two processes and if we speak about data stacks enterprise we will be even more because there can be um spark worker and many others so yes so multi-process containers exist they are invite use and if you see some uh complex configurations with things like s6 overlay you will know why it is it's not so easy to run multi-process container properly that's why i suggest you to avoid that that's possible but it's also doable so i did that it all was working very fine by the way um from the question earlier uh is there a way to use dash dash init with docker compose uh vasilis and youtube did answer he said there is a way to use a knit just add init colon true yep yeah thank you so much now base images so in general image rules are simple and very short first then to use official images uh be careful with the latest image prefer exact text when possible or at least less less generalized text i will explain in a moment use semantic versioning like in git or preferably exactly like in git if you release a new version of application version 3.5 0.7 you are going to release docker image 3.5.7 and uh next point if you are using custom base image you have to rebuild it regularly automatically preferably nightly so what does mean custom based image imagine you have two doors you are using micro services if you hand you have to dozens of different python services just for example there is nothing about python and they have all have similar dependencies like some libraries or they are all a using i don't know grpc or something and of course that you can have all the installations in the docker files per service but it doesn't make so much sense so you will have to do all the time the same job for different uh services and if you have to add one single dependency or change docker file you will have to change 20 docker files traditional way here is to have your own custom base image which uses inside let's say python 37 slim as we have seen today but you reuse that if from install the requirement dependencies call it like your company name python based image it may be a proprietary let's say doesn't matter in this case and all your um python microservices are reusing this base image so we basically just have to copy paste uh source code but they don't have to install anything so when build is uh very short and very quick that's a very good way so that's definitely a good practice but there is a trap so a lot of people get into this trap regularly as they have their base image as long as it works they never rebuild that and what it means over time month by month maybe even year by year base image of python 37 will evolve will have some security patches and fixes for the base docker image it was using also some um python improvements and fixes to 3.7 and you will never get this one if you don't rebuild your base image because it's kinda cash and if you don't invalidate and rebuild this cache you will never get anything new first of all and second of all after uh some years or months you may find out what something has changed and now you cannot build your custom base image anymore and mostly probably you are going to find it out exactly on the hot time when you are going to deploy something right now and you have to reveal that and it's not buildable anymore and you have to spend the full day on debugging and fixing your docker file and that's as you know usually happens in the more in the worst time so my recommendation use custom base image good now rebuild it regularly rebuild it automatically rebuild it nightly and don't forget to use at least smoke tests so you will be always sure what its operational and build is really build now i told you be careful with the latest image for vertex but text may be dangerous as well in general we speak about docker images as immutable objects if you have an image and you want to put any changes into this image as a result you are going to have two images one image is old and one image is old with fixes so new and you can delete old one but the new one will be new one so image is immutable as it is you can create a new you can delete all but you cannot change old you will always have new and with text it works a little bit different way so i have this free text downside and where is my pointer and some of them are mutable and some of them don't now tell me please um david how do you think latest is a mutable or immutable tech well i would think that is mutable because it's ever-changing depending on whatever the latest version is what are the yeah so if you release 12 3 4 latest will be 12 3 4. if you release 12 3 5 latest will be 12 3 5 but if we release 12 5 0 latest will be 12 5 0 and if we release 13 latest will be 13. that's why latest is dangerous following cementing versioning that's a major version and it means what every next major version may and very often will have breaking changes and at some point boom your system doesn't work why because you trusted latest image and for some cases for example we at data stacks for data stacks enterprise our kind of main project main product besides astro of course um we have no latest tech at all at all there is no latest you cannot do a docker compose pool data stacks enterprise server it doesn't exist that makes sense that's uh defense to avoid mistakes like that so latest will simply not work with data stocks enterprise server uh when 12 is mutable or immutable well i feel like that might be mutable because it's it's not an explicit version right i mean yeah it's a major version but what about the subversions and what happens when one of those gets updated exactly we still have miner and patch version and in 12 at least we promise to stick to major 12 version but we will so we will not go to 13 or 100 but we still can have miner or patch releases inside so it's kind of latest but limited to version 12. well then this one is also mutable because we stick to major and minor but patch may change and now final question is uh is this mutable or immutable deck i would like to think that that one is finely immutable when you have the version the tag all the way down to the patch yes and you are almost right because there is no oh there's more no no no no no no that's uh one missing word it should be immutable like with git you mostly probably know what it's a very bad practice to try to set uh to try to change tech as soon as you set tag and git push tags and your text will deliver it you may never change them after all especially if you are not the only one who works with a repository so um but technically you can and that's very bad and it's the same with docker 12.3 12.3.4 must be immutable but it isn't uh and um what i ask you as we are speaking of best practices please treat your texts and docker image texts as immutable don't change them as soon as they are assigned it it may lead to a very bad problems you will be hardly able to identify or debug it's a really bad idea to have things like that well then so all of the attacks are immutable and it's bad oh sorry all of the texts are mutable and that's bad so uh it's fine to have mutable uh latest major major minor but at least major minor patch should be always immutable that's what i beg you locks so i work a lot with the different developers and for many many many years and two things i hate the most well i hate a lot of things about uh how people do development do i need to pull out some alex memes [Laughter] not no not now so yeah yes yes yes so but two things done the worst locks and aurora handling that's just a real disaster how many developers don't understand what a locks there are and how they are important and how important proper roar handling most of the developers don't care about their handling they're um too optimistic and don't care about the logs because they are not the one not the people who maintain the application and i spent so many sleepless nights trying to debunk some systems complex systems but i was basically not able to do it well i was able to do it wasting weeks because they simply write nothing to logs like nothing or just okay startup boom we are done but no useful information so logs are important three main things you have to remember regarding locks first locks shoot b point you have to write logs that's important and if you don't know how to write logs you have to go and read some best practices about the language you are working with because that's really important second that comes from 12 factor application methodology i will maybe run the next course some months later i really like this one uh every lock is the event something is happened in this system and those events are goes into streams so operations people when then later work with them use some lock analytic tools splunk data dock whatever gcp google compute platform uses aws has also some lock analytics tools and so on and so forth every log developer deliveret is an event and it has to be in the proper event stream we will cover it maybe later maybe some months later i hope but when we speak now most specifically the rule is simple all the logs go to dash dev or slash dev study out a roar locks go to slash dev slash as to there you can send everything to slash dev slashes to doubt that already will be great my hero perfect uh if you can separate good logs from aurora locks so something went wrong something went good then it's even better because it makes much easier to analyze them then i analyze devastated out from multiple servers from multiple services when we have basically to set up rules like if there is an exception error warning we have to react somehow but if uh slash dev slash as to there that's much easier if there is something when we have something to take care of so a deficit doubt is good if you can't separate logs from good to bad that's already great if you're not so much uh linux guy i cannot spend too much time on the linux basics here but just remember so there are kind of devices or streams better to say in uh linux slash dev slash ested out standard output and slash devs slash s to their error standard output and you have to send all your output of your application to those two streams how to do that it depends on your uh language it depends on your framework so i cannot cover all of them of course it will take ages because we have a lot of languages and frameworks but in general first read the documentation for docs how to send logs to devastate out devastate there first and second if you work with an application which cannot send logs to custom places and always write swam to a file and that will taken two months to rework that it's again fine the only thing you need to do is to create a sim link again linux thing so this file will not be a real file but the symbol is symbolic link to the devested doubt and device there that's enough and you are great and your operations team will love you and finally that's the wrong place to put these uh logs thing into the best practices because it's not a best practice it's just a must-have that should be a law like never never write your docker logs to a file always send them to devastate out and we are about to over so few final words first one set the limits stay safe stay on a safe side first you nearly never want to use root user on the production root user should be avoidable at all costs it's fine to have it on build time although there are people trying to avoid even that but the first thing you have to avoid is to having root user running your processes and container after the build time on runtime how to do that very simple only thing we have to add here is to specify which user we are going to add and that's user's name let's say will be alex but as that's the linux theme we have to create this user first so i may want to have a run command with add user add group set user to group and so on that's kind of one more layer but definitely for safety worth this one more layer for some base images like node.js you may already have default user node and there are more things so if you are using a base image first check maybe it's already have prepared non-root user well then let's go on limit memory and swap this course is mostly for developers and your laptop problems is your laptop problems i care about your production so that's usually not for developers to decide but just know what uh guys on the production operations team will mostly probably run your container with limits enable it and they will limit memory and they will leave it through so you have to consider what exactly those limits are going to be you have to avoid memo leaks and those are things to consider definitely how much limit to set it very depends on your application so here i can transfer investigate these on your own or let's discuss it at our discord now when possible please use read only mode using volumes or bind mounts like what can be worse than downtime on production only one thing may be worse when downtime on production data loss on production and um i think data loss might actually be worse yeah i'm thinking about i mean that's not uh there is no jokes in many cases data loss is way much worse than uh downtime uh speaking about data try to use read-only mode than possible when mounting volumes of course there are situations you may not avoid that but uh in general we do recommend uh to have this one alex yeah fred over on youtube is asking how do we limit memory and swap with docker run so there are directives in docker run that's i don't remember i'm directly out of my memory but you can always find things like that docker run memory limit it was something simple resource constraints yes yeah [Music] memory swap memory swappiness kernel memory that's all good ah that just dash dash memory uh minimum allowed value is four megabytes the same for memory swap and so on on kill disable okay yep so now one more thing for some of the containers you may need more privileges than default container has some people tend to use privileged but that's deadly unsafe because privileged container especially when you run it with root user going to have full administrative privileges on your computer including cost and again and don't get scared so much if it's your laptop but it may be your production server with 200 cpu kernels and 300 uh random access memory gigabytes running thousands of containers so i would even kind of say you know if it's something you don't want to do in prague yeah there might be some cases where doing it on your local environment is okay but i wouldn't even get in the practice of it it's almost like the same argument was using allow filtering why even get the practice of doing it ever and just do it the way you're going to really do it when you deploy the things you're using the same kind of methods and processes everywhere yeah like may i jump out from this skyscraper okay but only one time [Laughter] so yes you can use dash dash privilege only one time and instead of that has some granularity with dash capability art instead option specifying which particular extra capability you want to add to your container that's pretty rare case and in general you should avoid things like that at all costs in some cases you may need them but in general try to avoid that try to find better way instead of using capabilities good and finally [Music] again back to linux basics bash streaked mode what is it how it works and why you should care let me show you so and i think i will get second sample so um we have here some lines which we have implemented pretty badly and usually you can find improvements like that okay so this let's work on this code or actually i've been i will even add this line so we have few lines of code bash script to be executed in the image we are building and it will work it's maybe not optimal and we aren't doing cleanup but it's not about cleanup for now we are installing some things what's wrong here is when you are running this script any of those lines may fail and what will happen then if for example this line fails nothing script will be executed further and it's even not so bad if it leads to problem on build time but in some cases it may lead to problems on runtime and if you don't detect that on time it may break your production because streak bash by default runs in non-strict mode but what i want to have here is i want to say bash hey bash we need strict mode and that looks pretty i need to yep so that looks a pretty weird and let me explain you to it step by step first of all that's a short that's a short form full comment will look like that and there are some more if you are a linux guy you may say right now but there are more options if you want to have the true bash strict mode yes they are but uh there are a lot of non-linux people so i'm trying to stay like um careful not overdue this is completely enough this is completely enough for most of the cases so first of all what this line does it says to linux fail on a roar in any line so if i set dash in it means if this line fails those two will not be executed and docker docker built immediately quits with an exit code so i will at least know what something failed worse than aurora can be only a work you don't know about that's the story about dash e when we have dash u dash u does the different job you may use environment variables during your build and that's actually pretty often case and if you are using environment variables which wasn't defined before normally it will be interpreted as just an empty space and that's like an old joke with ram dash ref some environment variable slash some environment variable but if you don't don't have those environment variables defined you are going to wipe out your root folder because well that's empty slash empty and that's not what you want to have so slash u for beats usage of undefined variables in the code so if i would try to do something here like that i don't know it will fail because this environment variables was never uh defined before so the dash u protects me for from typos if you define here uh get version but uh use uh you have a typo here and you have a new environment variable it will be not be executed like that it will fail and finally dash o pipe fail it sets an option with some commands especially like that like i don't know you have seen what i did today docker images grab alpine if you have your command first command fail it nothing will happen and the output will be forwarded over the pipe to the second part of the command and you will never see this output because it's hidden by grep for example so dash o pipe fail uh sets the mode so if something on the left side on the pipe fails overall script will be failed as well so it's a bash screen bash strict mode and when you have things like that you definitely may want to have things like that that's over complication so we can make it like this it will look better and it will work exactly the same way that's bash strict mode simplify it a little bit well then and we are almost done health check now that's funny these new thing happened to be since year 2016 but nearly no one uses them and that's incredible because that's actually a very powerful tool called health check so take a look uh we have an application running and docker says it's running so we say docker ps docker says it's up but how does docker judges if it's up or down very simple if p1 process is running we are running boom but you know what in many cases it may be not the thing in many cases you need something more complex to define if your application is good or is up or down or something like that maybe it's an infinite loop maybe something else but it may be not operational anymore health check you may specify when you are running docker run command you may specify health check in the docker compose file but uh the place to be for it truly is the health check uh in the in your image because as an image creator you know how to check if it's operational or not so first it starts with a health check definition statement when we define a command and what exactly we have to do to check the local application if we are running something at port 8080 we can just make a simple curl if the exit code is 200 we are good exit 0 by default or some linux exit 0 so if it's not exit code 2 x x when we exit 0 and after a couple of checks docker will say what application is running but unhealthy and operations may have a warning but okay there is something to take care of or maybe to restart or something of course comment maybe might score much more complex so you may grab for some output assure what there is not only answer 200 code but something more maybe your application doesn't have any open ports at all and do any another job so that's better for you to decide how to check if application is running or not and then finally we may define intervals timeouts and retries and if interval setting by default is more or less suitable so timeout setting by default is 30 seconds which is definitely too much from my point of view so mostly probably you will need to decrease timeout time if your application is not able to respond within 10 seconds i guess it's dead and when we speak about docker compose it looks like as predictable as here we again define test and we define interval time out retries and you may have nice improvements like why in one minute 30 seconds like with these amps and s alpha all good seconds never hurt good final one right before we move on to the linters uh alex there was a question with regard to uh the bash uh strict mode is that are those running per each instance of the run statement um and if i if i set it once like you have there but then i have a following run statement right uh do i need to reset it for each one uh so uh in this case um this is why this one is a little overkill first of all let's take a look dash o pipe fail except this line which i've added i have no pipelines here right so it's redundant and we can delete that and also i don't have any user variables here i can delete this you and this one will be enough for those four lines because where only what can happen if first line fails i will quit immediately and no known of these set options will be applied to next run because it will be a fresh new container so some of those are if you had variables or something then you can apply them again yeah or or as you've shown us before combine those into a single run if applicable right to reduce the amount of layers you have and such but for this single run statement we don't need even this one because it's a single command and if it has exit code non-zero when docker will treat this as exit code no zero build failed so we again even don't need it at all so we're talking about multi-line statements yeah multi-line statements and when we need these why i still recommend to stick to this one very simple today here we don't have pipe pipes and we don't have variables tomorrow we will and the one who will add them will of course forget to specify it here and it won't hurt to have them there if you don't have pipes or if you don't have variables that's not going to do anything extra so you might as well just start there yep yep yep i see another option what people do from time to time as well i can show instead of um how it's called in english point and comma dot and comma like instead of this character oh semicolon semicolon you know uh thank you uh some people do that yeah and that's another trick which may work not so bad because but basically what it does it uh just does the same job as set dash e so what's that that means end and that means what execute second command only if first one succeeded that's right that's right and if a update will fail when second command will not be executed which one prefer ampersands or set dash e i really have no idea that's for you to decide what you prefer to have in your code they both will do the same uh i'm you i i'm personally using ampersands just because i'm used to it so i was doing that like all life uh but set dash e uh dash u dash o pipeline pi fail may work better of course good so we are done with health checks and the last thing i'm going to show you today you are tired i guess but stay strong we are almost done and then quiz and i'll let you go so uh linters if you are developers and you don't use linters first of all you should find a linter for your language um so true yes so true nothing too odd uh in short what is the linter linter is the best practices check automated check so you can check the best practices of your docker file even without me which sounds good uh so uh let's exa let's take a look at for example on the right so there is a docker file you see lines specified by white from debian run copy run expose cmd and by the yellow you have notices warnings from linter for example from debian hey always take the version of an image explicitly when we have node version is referenced by node assign it delete we update list after installing something what does that mean we have update update update install but we don't have a ram ref we don't have uh update purge and so on so we aren't cleaning our image will be too big avoid additional packages by specifying no install recommends yes with this install we can bring packages we aren't going to use image will be bigger but we will have but for no purpose when here we are doing switch to your user src app and npm install static to switch to directory better to use workdir pin versions in npm instead of install instead of npm install package use npm install package version that's exactly what i said you would have told you before we've upgrade install install versions that's the best practice and expose 8 80 000 valid unix ports range from zero to 65 000. this is a wrong port and there are some linters exist this is an output of a hudolin and there is a docker linter and some more i believe i don't have experience with them so i can't recommend them with hadolint you may play around directly live on the internet so that's what i like the most so i will not hide output and i want to make it a bit bigger i really like them they're uh how to say logo here the fiskat that's amazing but okay so we have this file analyzer linted and i'm going to say from debian jesse one of the versions and i run lind okay first warning is gone and i may say no install recommends and i'm adding it here no install recommends and i'm linking it again okay it looks better then i can use workdir work dear run and i'm going to expose not the port 80 thousands but just port 8 8 000 link good and so on and so forth so you see i've solved some of the warnings uh within just few clicks using clean trigger and that's a web version and you can also use uh that that's actually not what you could use but what you should use what i say uh you have to install any linter whatever you prefer to your integrated development environment first and second you may need to in to add it to your continuous integration tests and code style checks if you have them if you don't have you should so fred over on youtube and matter of fact you just mentioned about integrating linter into your ide so the trouble i had with the dockerfire linter in vs code is that it checks only a file with the dockerfile name and not anything else and i have multiple docker files with different names okay i mean it sounds like that i'm sure you just used is one way to do it but i wonder if you have something else uh formed in vs code that he could do at the time i was mostly uh i was working with docker all the time was the times when we had no linters at all and my best linter was here between my ears so uh what i can say mostly probably it's configurable so i'm using this code and i have this plugin installed so it saves me it says to me some warnings and if i go to this maintainer let me revert that yeah so if i go i want to reverb that good so it saves me what maintainer and deprecated and so on and i guess that should be configurable somewhere we have to see configure file associations maybe for some special plugins but to be very honest yes linked so i think i have something here there is the configuration and disable enable uninstall copy extension settings maybe this one maybe we are going to have some settings here i to be honest uh usually work with simple docker file so i cannot answer right now but there should be a way to solve that of course good so that's the story behind that and finally we are getting to week four assignment so assignment uh of this week includes two steps first step that's about to optimize one of the docker files of your choice you can pick one of the suggested or find something on your own what you would like to rework maybe some people are using docker already and have some old projects we want to rework try to make it smaller smaller try to exclude redundant dependencies try to keep docker file cells sufficient think not only about the size as it is but also caching and build time as well for multi-process containers as you will have some in the homework assignment in the github report you may need docker compose to separate them as there are some multi-processing done not really correct uh and second part implement automated build from project 4.1 from previous point or from the last week using a build server of your choice we suggest jvci or github actions a build pipeline should include at least should include at least docker build testing at least some smoke tests and docker push to hub docker.com if you think right now there are some topics those are not covered in this workshop of course because it was all covered in previous workshops or that's a request for you to dive into the documentation and if you cannot do that if you stuck at some point go to discord link is on the right side right above david and or contact us by email discord is better cool by the way i didn't hear from jack but i do oh he's responding now but i do see that i drop the link in the chat there there is a separate core or a separate registration eventbrite for the kubernetes course next monday um oh wait wait jack just responded yes but everyone who registered for docker will be notified as if they have registered ah okay good good so you don't have to register separately you will get your clusters anyway that's okay great and um what i can say that's all folks you are great thank you for staying with us such a long time we enjoying it a lot and thank you david thank you everyone thank you jack i see people answering questions in chat also from datastax team that's always a lot of fun to work together and thank you for being awesome and see you when in discord see your emails i didn't answer all of the emails and all of the messages especially on github i was very busy i'm sorry i will react to all of them we just have some multiple projects in parallel so i'm a bit tired how it's called torn apart to multiple projects i don't know maybe i said it wrong but you know what i mean i have too much on my table right now but we will get back i will get back to you in later on this week and answer all the all questions on github email and discord as well thank you for coming today it was a great pleasure and see you later next week on the same page [Music] foreign [Music] clothes [Music] you",
