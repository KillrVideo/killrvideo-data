    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems hey it's Jeff carpenter I live in the studio again with Katherine Eriksson welcome thank you welcome to catch she is our director of strategic partnerships here at Data sacks and we have brought her in today to talk about docker docker everyone's doing it well is everyone doing it I don't know but it's certainly popular right now and we we want to get to the bottom of why are people using docker in particular for distributed databases and is that a good thing is that a bad thing and also there's a little bit of an announcement that that we have to make that's that's coming out so okay let's jump right into it okay so let's start about talking for for those of you who may not know what is docker sure so you can think about docker as the next evolution of virtual machines it's this immutable packaging of everything that you need to run a piece of software with really good and tight resource management gotcha okay so how does that how does that compare to other virtualization technologies that we've used in the past what's the distinctive sure ISO docker takes advantage of some things in Linux to to really restrict resource usage they use C groups and namespaces and you can think about that as the physical and logical segmentation of resources in a system when you think about a virtual machine you have the set amount of resources and space that are used to run a physical machine virtualized on a host when you think about a docker image let's say that you're running two instances of data stacks enterprise on a host and you're running that using a docker image so you're actually only running one a bunch of process with DSE installed as in a layer on top of that and when you run the container you just have a writeable layer on top of that image so it's a really efficient use of those resources right okay so that's what I think of it I agree as that the value proposition of docker is that it's very efficient in its resource usage and there is that ease of use that goes along with it for a great developer experience that I think it's made it real popular so let's see the key controversial question that we should dive into here is there's there's a lot of discussion that's been back and forth about whether databases and your data tier is a good fit for containers so where do you stand on this issue I'm in the middle I think it depends on the organization and their use case and I understand the argument for and the argument against when you think about the folks that are saying you shouldn't do this you know it's not easy when you think about a distributed database you have state in terms of the data that's going into the database yeah and the configurations as well and our customers make changes to configurations in production when you have a spike in traffic times of the year could sway how your system is used what your heap settings might be these are changes to production systems when you think about docker container you think about something that's locked down and immutable supposed to be immutable so you really don't want to be changing your configuration or you shouldn't be right and so the thoughts around this have changed over the last couple years when you think about a docker container you think about a single process that's followed for that container and if that process dies data stacks Enterprise dice and that container with it dies so you want one single process per container when you think about something like data stacks Enterprise that's got like Cassandra SPARC solar graph capabilities you think about we're not one process not one process same three or four right right but the same principle applies if the main process dies the container should die as well and that's how data sex Enterprise would handle that in a bare metal system so we need to be able to manage the database files outside of the container we need to be able to manage configurations that could change over time but there's a lot of benefit to having that immutable packaging of the software so DSE is not gonna be the first thing that you contain your eyes in your environment probably not okay but with with the right doc our expertise with the right database expertise it is something that the technology is mature enough to handle okay and what about volume management oh yeah you know that one of the things about containers is that you know they're very dispensable so one of the concerns that I have even in running docker with our killer video reference application on my own desktop is oh I need to I even need to configure kind of external volume storage for my data or I have to be really careful not to do my docker compose down and throw away all my data that I've been building up for days right you can talk about this in different ways depending on how you're using docker containers in which database your container izing with Cassandra with data stacks we follow the principle of local storage local fast storage is best and docker provides a few ways to achieve using local and fast storage and storing your data outside of the container so you can use hosts volumes and you can set that by a single file or a single directory which you attach to the container and then there's a lot of storage plugins now that make using shared storage with containers more efficient so if your database supports that route works well in that environment those options are maturing as well I will say though just like you said if you're using host volumes that is a place where troubleshooting gets difficult fast and right right so what we're trying to do is make that easier and it's a usability feature and depending on where you stand and how to use docker you may use this way and embrace it or not but what we're saying is we know that data stacks enterprise has upwards of 30 configuration files that cost or could change you wouldn't really see somebody changing that many configuration files but they're there right and if we want to put out a product we have to make it uniform and applicable to all of our customers and so what we're doing is offering this configuration folder so you map a host volume - I think it's slash mount slash column maybe it's just slash comp but you can put in that folder any of these 30 configuration files and then internally we map those to the immutable original versions in the container so each time the service or container starts those configuration files are mapped into the container and then you can use regular configuration management to control those within the host volumes okay so as excited as I am about all of that that you just described what I just realized is that you're talking about configuration files and things that we're doing to make the usability experience of deploying data sacks enterprise in a docker container to be easier right okay so we're doing this now like we're we're in the container business we are doing this so yeah what's happening why what are we doing with with data sects enterprise and docker and why now so for years we thought should we be doing this and finally are our customers told us yes you should be doing this we did start listening to them we do listen yeah we absolutely do listen we've provided darker guidance and best practices in the past and the feedback from customers was that it wasn't enough and so what were what we're about to provide is three docker images as well as public access to the github repo which any any company or any user that wants to customize those images can can clone and customize from there oh that is awesome okay so yeah there have been sort of unofficial images that have been available luke Toman one of our evangelists had a couple of that have been pretty popular a little plug for loop yes so do you actually do we have any statistics for that like how much are people using DSE on docker okay so as much as I want to say we listen to our customers we have to look at the market data as well yeah and so we want to look at the market data across distributed databases that are in our space as well as Cassandra and data stacks Enterprise okay so yeah let's broaden it a little yeah so Dana sex Enterprise has been downloaded more than a million times without ever having an official image from the company Wow okay yeah and so docker tracks pools or downloads and the number that they track goes up to 10 million so after 10 million you don't really know between 10 and a billion we don't really know and so Cassandra and the different versions that are available on docker hub which is kind of the the universe we can download docker images I think last I counted was around 22 million pools but somewhere between 22 million and infinity okay you don't really know the number yeah fair enough and that's just public repository polls that's enough nothing to say for any private repositories in corporate environments right absolutely we're or docker private repositories any any company that's doing their CI or development within docker we don't have we don't have access to those numbers either right okay in other words this is happening all the time it's happening all the time our customers want it the market data shows us that that's where customers want to find our product gotcha so who else is doing this we're not the only ones that are kind of taking this step right right what's the what's the broader trend in the industry here with respect to distributed databases and docker sure so even though even the largest players in the relational world are going the shroud as well Dockers had docker hub for years now and last year they launched docker store and that got the attention more of the enterprise players in the space so you see Oracle is in docker store with some offerings in docker hub okay but then you see you see all the players Couchbase Hortonworks cloud era most of the companies in our space have at minimum their tooling in docker hub per store but usually now even the  products okay gotcha and let's um I want to jump into that and talk about that a little bit what's that distinction between docker hub and docker store because I think it's a might be a little bit confusing for for people that aren't intimately familiar with these different ways of accessing images can you talk about sure at the highest level we're most familiar with with docker hub if you have docker installed you can search for docker images through the command line you see everything that's listed in in hub anybody can publish images to docker hub darker store offers some features that are interesting to an enterprise company like ours they do security scanning of the images before we publish them they do they offer certification of the images and that makes sure that you've built this image in line with their best practices they also offer support to customers that are looking for somebody to support the darker piece so right now we're offering our images for non production environments but when we do offer them for production our customers would have the opportunity to get support for the docker portion from docker and the DSC portion from from data stacks and maybe somewhere in between that's something that we'll work out over time I really like that though because I do think that you know having come from an on startup kind of environment a more corporate environment where we want configuration control we don't want to just be using some random docker image that was on hub that who knows who put that together or what's actually in that image without having but the ability to have that certification of yeah this is not only from the actual company that provides this database but it's been certified for docker best practices I think that's a that's a definite win yes minoo it is a couple extra steps but once you subscribe to an image you know it associates the the the user name with the image and you can pull that image just like you do any other docker image from that point forward okay so I want to circle back on a couple of things because there's we've been talking about a lot of details first of all you mentioned that there are three images that we're going to be providing why don't you enumerate what those are sure so data stacks and prize will be the first image and that will be in docker store and then we'll have ops center which is our management GUI and studio which is the development interface available in docker hub ok excellent so what what what's the distinction then the DSC the core is gonna be in the store and the others are in the hub and that's the rationale there sure so you think about the flagship product as being in store they're all built from the same base in äj-- so we want the security scanning of the main image and we want that to go in to store it also helps us track who's using these you register for an account in darker store and it helps us understand the rate of adoption from customers versus versus those that are evaluating the product and then it makes sense to put the tooling in docker hub you wouldn't really use ops center or studio without data stacks enterprise to make those difficult to get grab those from hub once you have DSC ok so we're not tracking we don't have that same level of tracking that we're looking to do and we want it in the store so that we can support you mm-hmm but it's less important yeah and that's what we see across the industry we see flagship products in either store or store and hub and tooling always in hub ok great that I mean that clarified for me because I was one of my companies did things that way ok so and you mentioned that we are supporting DSC and ops center and Studio running in docker for development environments that's right okay what about production right so we we expect to learn some things from launching these images we expect them to be very attractive to developers and those pursuing docker in non production environments and we're gonna use what we learn from those to make sure that we're prepared to launch these for production environments so we're gonna start with a 60 day trial and we're gonna iterate on these and see how it goes we don't have a timeline for production yet I am confident and what we've built and how it's going to be received in the industry I'm excited to see the initial feedback we're looking for folks to file issues and and github in directly in the repo or in data stacks Academy slack and as we get that feedback we'll have a better idea of what the production timeline would be nice okay good and I you know you've been hearing from me because I've been playing with these official images their early access internal version and I think it's gone really really well I'm really excited about the offering so where do I go now if I'm interested let's say I've gotten all excited here the DSC is now officially available in docker what do I do sure so there's a blog on our website that will point you to the images to the Academy tutorials and to everything you need to get started you should depending on the timing of this release of this release you should see the images now in docker store and hub they're their search for data stacks search for the product names they're available okay excellent so let's get started and get downloading these doctor images and I get get us your feedback we're excited about this we're excited about doing distributed databases in docker the right way right way pushing this conversation forward in industry as well all right cat well it's been a pleasure having you out today I'd love to have you back in the future because I have all kinds of questions sort of a follow-on to this that we didn't even have time to get to about orchestration what do I do with all these containers now that I have them how can I manage kind of this environment at scale where I'm starting and stopping multiple containers and and provisioning all sorts of stuff can you help me out with that absolutely that's the natural follow-on question from our customers and I think it's a good topic to cover excellent okay so look forward to another episode coming soon with Kat and we'll talk about orchestration thanks for watching the distributed data show Thanks thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to the distributed data show page on data stacks Academy and tell us
