afternoon good evening wherever you are for those of you who have been here you know at the drill we do a sound check to make sure that you hear two voices and no more than two Stefano hello everyone Hi rocks nice to see you here hi everyone yes please can you hear us loud and clear let us know yeah let us know in the chat if you can hear us loud and clear perfect okay thanks for responding on that one I thank you Aaron I can't believe that we are already on the final boot camp Series right um so for those of you who have been with us in the last two weeks uh you know welcome back but for those of you who did not but made it only to this one don't worry you know we have you covered we will take care of that um so with that said let me move on my name is raghavan srinivas I go by Rags um you know basically work as a developer advocated data Stacks um and I my undergraduate education was believe it or not in mechanical engineering um you know a long time ago but what I like about these workshops is that you know this is the closest I can come to see things move um you know because it's all about code it's all about getting your hands dirty uh but you know we made it you know in such a way that it gets only as dirty as required meaning we install a lot of things for you make it very easy but at the same time you don't hide anything okay so you will see uh that you know if you work go to your gitpart version all that you need is a GitHub account uh all the code is there all the scripts are there and you can you can try it out yourself later as well and and that's the nice part about being in data stacks and being as a developer advocator love to teach and communicate and we get this opportunity to do this Wednesday workshops and towards the end we will also talk about uh kind of a in-person event um and and one of the things I'm really passionate about is kind of the inner loop which leads to a lot of developer productivity and I'm extremely happy always ecstatic to be with the great Stefano so with that said introduce yourself okay so I'm Stefano nice to see you all it's cool because there are uh it's nice to see a lot of you here today I'm a developer advocated data Stacks as well here you see my coordinates if you want to connect I'll be glad I'm a developer and architect I love Cassandra Apache Cassandra and related distributed database and Technologies I used to be a physicist at theoretical physicist at that since long time I moved on to it and distributed system but I also have there is quite a a bit of a more than a bit of a teacher in me so that's where I am so yeah let's go so we have an entire crew some of them are on the chat and and they are helping us out you know in in always possible so you know the Wednesday workshops wouldn't have happened without the crew because we kind of get to share this you know every now and then right and uh um you know you you I'm sure you'll see them in the remaining installments or some of the other workshops but there are no remaining remaining installments because January 11th was we learned about kind of what nosql is and we'll talk about that a little bit today as well um and one of the fundamental things you want to worry about when you're designing your applications when you're designing your Solutions is kind of coming up with efficient data models obviously we couldn't do justice in the two and a half hours or whatever it took you know but still um you know this is something that you need to pay attention uh and the final part of course is building a back end within nosql database and today we are going to go through that and like I said you know it's going to be all Hands-On um you know we will uh in a moment do some warm-up with mentee where we will try to find the audience you know who you are you know what kind of programmer you are how do you build back-ends or how do you build front ends whether you're a front-end developer and all that we will uh talk about that uh in this code I mean in today's uh Hensel lab or Workshop uh we are going to focus on maybe two languages uh of course you have the option of kind of doing uh you know um any three of them like Java Python and node okay JavaScript right uh you can do any of the three um but but you know we will primarily walk through two and we'll we'll get to how we pick the second one in in a second okay yeah but yeah but I I may add one thing two things actually first if you're really if you want the difficulty level up you can try three languages at once if you somehow manage to but more seriously don't worry because we will later give you a reference to all instructions because everything is spelled out on a repository with code and instructions for you to just go by yourself and at your own pace and follow your Rhythm yeah absolutely yeah you know yeah so so take your own pace sir you know you don't need to hurry through because you know you can always uh go back and kind of look at the instructions so um the agenda for today is basically again you know we're going to do an introduction we're going to look at microservices and why Apache Cassandra right uh because it's not enough to have just reactive programs you need some responsive data to go with it as well and that's where Cassandra shines right it's really about scale response and so on and we'll talk about that um we will take the easy option for microservices with rest apis because there are all you know there are different ways of doing this right but you know as they say the prerogative of the teacher is to take the simple example and then let you build a more complex example with grpc and other graphql and other apis um so here we will just touch upon rest apis but the philosophy as you will see is exactly the same right you know you're going to have you know different services and one of the service will expose in API and that's going to be used by the client or maybe your mobile phone know whatever the case may be we are going to continue to use the same data model that you saw in week two but if you're not familiar with it don't worry about it it's a sensor sensor application and we'll talk about this there is going to be a very simple sense of rest API and again if you didn't attend the you know the previous data modeling Workshop you can go back and look at it as well but primarily what's next okay we have a homework uh we are not very how would you call it very strict graders right but but we we want to make sure that you know you have done your work because we do offer Badges and you will talk and we'll talk about that in a second uh anything you want to add Stefano um yeah Ah that's okay I think you said it all just we we offer something that is more than a certificate of attendance something like that proves that you not only did passively attend but you did stuff that's why we we up the game with a little homework which involves coding and we will grade it and release homework but that will be shown later perfect uh but again you know I mean you've heard me say this before if you've been in the workshop uh and and I really am kidding you not um is that we are living in the Golden Age of developers um you know despite what's happening in the industry uh I think there are so many resources for us to get uh comfortable with whatever we want um you know um gone are those days uh when you had to thumb through manuals to figure out you know what happened and there was you know like no source code to play with I had to do all of that myself um we have plenty of resources from data Stacks devs itself but course you know there is so much that the industry also provides um you know in particular to name some of the resources that we provide uh you are in a live Workshop which you know thanks again for attending um you know and and and trying to um kind of enrich your understanding right uh but we also have these workshops recorded on youtube.com you know go to youtube.com datastacks devs uh and and the same you know instructions are on github.com data Stacks devs so just look for data Stacks does and you should be able to find it we also make it a little bit of fun and you know mentee is going to be coming up uh shortly but essentially we want to find out who you are but also want to find out what understanding level um you know have you achieved and that is not primarily a comment on you but it's also a primary a comment on ourselves right because we want to make sure we we cover the topics um and and and we'll have some fun with it uh in general you can chat on YouTube and you know like I said you know we have a lot of people trying to help as well uh but in this card you know there are a whole lot more people who can who can jump in uh so so think of it like a more um you know non-transactional um you know um discussion if you will you know if you want to put it on Discord that'll be great um and um like I said GitHub gitpart we use gitpod and and you know for those of you who've never used this you'll be blown away by this um very very cool oh yeah yeah indeed and we have actually come up with a um you know with a solution that is replacing catacota uh you know some of you might have used category scenarios before uh but unfortunately you know that got closed uh but we have come up with something that you know enhances a good part to kind of uh come very close to what category scenarios are uh and and shortly you know some of these workshops will have that as well in fact uh you probably saw a sneak peek of that last week uh so if you want to go back and look at the recording you can take over that as well uh we recently introduced the Astra uh CLI okay which not only takes Astra which is very easy to use but takes it one step further from a developer perspective to be able to connect and you will see a lot of the magic today all that you do is do an extra setup and put in your token and boom everything happens okay but that's not all there's so much more right and and that's the school or cool part oh yeah we even sponsored your learning um you know we do um give you certification vouchers I mean not after this Workshop perhaps uh but but there are ways of getting this um you know especially if you attend the Cassandra Summit and we'll talk about that um they just want you to you know get educated that's our goal here right um like I said you know you ha you can submit um your homework we grade it and then we provide you this cool badge yeah looks very cool yes which you which you should uh post around to because that gives you bragging rights absolutely everywhere claims um you know it seems to get your salaries up as well huh don't hold me to that but but that's what it is all right with that said um I think I will stop talking and I will let Stefano take over with the mentee um okay just give me a awesome Stefano before I set this all up okay yes so let me summon uh the command so in the YouTube chat you will see uh instructions so you go to menti.com either with your phone or in a different browser tab I think you can also uh scan the code that is now on screen I will turn on the music if it's too loud let me know please okay so uh if you go to mentee.com you will be able to enter this code five seven five one ten twenty two or you see it in the YouTube chat that's for you to join our interactive session first now we will just ask you a few questions to to know our audience so what kind of uh experience you have what what is your favorite language and a couple other questions where are you from uh but later so please keep the connection to mentee open because later by the end of this Workshop we will have a small quiz as rugs mentioned to well reinforce your knowledge uh and and also to to check whether we were being good at giving you the main concepts of today so let's see we have a bunch of people who already joined maybe we wait another few seconds to get to 60 so I think we should wait for a little bit yeah I I think someone could still join while we are starting so so I think we can start and there are just a few questions to find out more about you so first question are you located for the benefit of our audience of course I know that you are located in Boston I am in Italy so Greetings From Italy but please tell us where are you from okay so I see a lot of a lot of bubbles in the map so Europe U.S Central America India middle of Africa Indonesia is it Indonesia maybe Malaysia a lot of Canadians yeah nice I'm wow everywhere from all around the world I'm originally from the language and you know for those of you from India uh happy Republic day which is tomorrow I miss my morning runs in lalbagh you know in Bangalore and and recently um some you know one of my friends sent me a picture of the flower shows so if you get a chance check out the lalbagh flower show [Music] nice okay so um well a lot a lot of people from everywhere Saudi Arabia as well nice okay so next question which might be more related to our content of today uh this is just to gauge the level of how how much we should focus on the introductory part so uh did you attend the other two weeks of this bootcamp so the first was introduction to Cassandra the second was Data modeling with Cassandra uh so did you attend either or both of them okay so let's see the responses are pretty much varied do you want to put the chord again um you know see if yeah but maybe I think it's coming okay it's coming okay so we have you know we have okay oh they say this site is not opening so let's give it a little bit of time maybe you know maintain is running into some hiccups okay that's yeah that's weird yeah I think Mente might have had some trouble because I I saw we were at four plus yeah yeah and now it's 50 participants and then and then it got so let me refresh the command um empty not working sorry about that looks like it is at least partially working but I mean that's a great segue into our message right um you know we are in a world of microservices and sometimes it's hard to figure out what's what's wrong you know it could be just be the only internet connection but uh but at the same time you know it's impossible for me to come up with some service like mentee which does such a great job or like a good part that you'll see later uh but but at the same time it adds a level of complexity um that that you'll have to deal with and yeah and and maybe this is also a prime example of isolated failure because maybe mainti might have a hiccup but we are giving you this Workshop nevertheless so that's great imagine if yeah yeah then everything will come out into its knees you know that's that's exactly right okay I see maybe there is a trouble with the background okay uh I see so maybe there is something going on with serving the images which is another probably a different service than the question actually I should tell you what my guess you know many had to fail I would rather it failed here than during the quiz right because then you know so let's hope you know pray that it will be fine during the quiz right no so yeah okay so let's see yeah I've seen the comments you should try to select or highlight the text on the page so maybe there is some trouble serving for mentee serving the background image oh is that what it is okay we should just so so maybe we moved to a new template um you know we rebranded um so maybe that's the problem so we will we will we will try to describe it again I'm gonna try it myself you know because I've been doing too many things here so let me try that uh I I just go forward with the mentee and then maybe we can just take care of preparing a different background for a light background for for the waste part so maybe yeah okay I will share the code whoever wants to try and join from a different browser you're welcome too okay okay so in the meantime for those who are using the trick of selecting the text just to get an idea or maybe we can also look in in the chat at this point so you can feel free to answer in the chat in the YouTube chat as well just to have an idea uh did you do your homework okay so I see varied responses here yeah for those of you who who said there's homework yes there is homework and if you want to get your badge you should do it it's very simple just a bit of coding exercise this week last weeks it was different things of course okay so shall we move on and there is probably a last question we were not mistaken which is who have done everything right but but you know no worries again you know we will kind of go through that uh today as well okay so there is a question how to catch up uh we will share the link later this is uh whoever joined right now you're you haven't missed anything of the content part which we are about to start um this question about language is of course there is always a bit of a heated uh discussion I see someone on on the Java cam someone else on the python camp is that we are covering several languages in this content of today and we will probably try to cover Python and Java and leave JavaScript as a exercise for the reader let's see but yeah so I see Python and python is overwhelmingly more preferred than Java today that's not always the case but it's interesting to know I I understand I think I'm I'm done with this hands-online I'm I'm going I'm a Java guy but yeah Cedric Cedric do not Cedric do not do not please do not spark a language flame War here because we have stuff to do today with sir I'm joking but actually okay so let's move on because yes interjecting I think we talked about this first we we said you know maybe python might actually be more popular and and you know we're going to start with python anyway and then a little bit of java uh for for those of you so yeah that's the idea I think we kind of you know um it's you know kind of anticipated this you know and for those of you um you know who who are new to python you know if you want to Learn Python we have another Workshop coming up in uh what is it like uh two weeks where um you know one of the influencer influencer Sharma um is going to be uh kind of walking walking you through um you know a uh a really getting started kind of Python program okay so all right so with that said let's move on anything else to add uh um thank you for answering the question and sorry for the inconvenience about pente we will try to optimize it for loading and displaying let me take a note uh yeah I think you can switch maybe you did already to your screen and go on with the content part all right um so intro to Apache Cassandra you might have heard of this ring architecture that we have right you know essentially um you know what happens is that you know this is a node I mean there are multiple nodes right and and these nodes kind of talk to each other um you know think about this as a social network where they are all gossiping right they're actually using a protocol called gossip where they exchange some information more than just a health check you know health check gives you a basic information but it doesn't tell you whether you know I'm getting a lot of data why don't you shift my um you know my traffic onto the neighboring node in fact Cassandra actually talks at that gossip protocol level and and kind of makes that adjustment in real time because it has more information than just the health check right and that's why it's able to do a lot of these things especially achieve linear scalability highest availability you know you you usually have three replicas so that you know if one particular node is down uh chances are that gossip protocol has already conveyed this information across the entire cluster um you know across the entire ring and and the other node is ready to serve up which has the replica for that piece of data um you know we will talk about partition key because that's the easiest way you know to achieve what is referred to as order one you know which is constant right order N means you know you're going through all the nodes to find the data which is not efficient by any means um what you really want to do is to be able to achieve constant access and you can do that by uh some kind of algorithm called hashing algorithm uh and and we use something called as a consistent hashing algorithm which makes it you know to put it very simply but basically what it does is given a key key it goes exactly that node if that node is down then it picks up from the replicas and does all this behind the scenes right my over simplified view of Apache Cassandra are a nosql kind of infrastructure is that um you know I could do all of this myself but the problem is what happens when you know a particular node is down you know what happens when more nodes are added let's say I want to achieve scalability by adding you know by doing horizontal scaling as we do here um in essence Apache Cassandra takes care of all of this right it is platform agnostic as you will see you can create your database uh you know either on Google cloud or on AWS or on Azure but today we will be primarily using Google cloud and monk scanner and we'll get to that in a second um when I did my computer science masters at University of Southwestern Louisiana okay or now called as University of Louisiana at Lafayette one of the things that I went through was this book by CJ date I don't know if any of you use that but basically it's about normalizing your data okay so no matter what your application doesn't matter what your application is right you normalize the data normalize the haircut of it and then start using it right it makes sense to a certain degree it makes certain sense in in a lot of ways uh you know because it's really about achieving the thing called acid or atomicity consistency isolation and durability but it may not be applicable to all the use cases right so what you typically do when we talked about this you know we will send you pointers to the video later about the previous two weeks uh if you want to go and kind of dig into it or if you want to understand a little bit more after this Workshop how exactly was the data model done you know you can go back and look for that but the idea is that you start with a conceptual data model but more importantly you identify the use use cases or identify the access patterns okay and then you come up with this logical data model called the Chabot code diagram okay and then you optimize it and actually implement the physical data model okay so start with really the use cases you know CJ dates you know the normalization form is fantastic um you know because it's it's good for you know especially consistency and so on because otherwise you will have to achieve the consistency um you know in your application education sometimes but again you know if you come to the Cassandra Summit in March you might get a sneak peek on asset transactions on top of Cassandra with a protocol called a card you know which is a lightweight protocol as compared to you know the two-phase commit and we'll talk about all of this but essentially you know the thing to understand here is that nosql and Cassandra is really more applicable um you know to different use cases and to use case patterns than anything else but fundamentally your application development kind of looks like this right and and I'm probably stating the obvious here right uh you have a front-end you know which could be your browser or your mobile phone or whatever right and then you have what is the what is sometimes referred to as the uh back end or sometimes referred to as the business logic right where you kind of do certain things but to be able to do certain things you need the database in the back end right or database tier okay so front end business and then data right um and what we're going to see today is uh pretty much all of these three tiers in action right but the focus is really going to be on the um the driver and the database tier so how do we model the data and how do we access the model data you know from your application uh we're going to see a code for both uh for three which is Javascript Java and python uh and and since python overwhelmingly won today I think we will start with python maybe we should move the icons so that python is fast but but you know no no no oh wait wait this is important when I when I checked the slides I took care of ensuring there were no preferred languages so that's why you will see permutations of this tree in various places in the deck that's intentional oh wow that's really intentional I don't want to give preference myself I didn't know that level of detail I know Stefano is very detailed uh but but this is this is even beyond all right um I have done distributed systems for a long time and come on nightmares when I hear the term korba um you know I don't know if any of you heard it you can put it in the chat uh but essentially you know um I I've stood on the shoulders of um you know um basically I would call them as distributed systems stalwarts um you know you might have heard of the uh seven fallacies of computing eight fallacies of computing and so on but essentially what seems to happen is that distributed systems morphs every every 10 years or so okay so we started about you know with the monoliths in the 80s you know I remember CICS you know um if you if you did a stop run in your Cobalt program it would bring the entire cscs infrastructure down not a good idea right uh like for example you know today what uh you know Stefano was saying let's say we had all of this in one monolith uh if mentee was not working we couldn't have proceeded with the presentation itself right so not a good idea um you know and then what happened was you kind of split up the front end the back end and the data tier uh you know into into this different tiers uh you still have this Concepts right but the idea is that instead of having this distinct front end back-end and data even your front end right could be multiple Services okay and that's where the service oriented architecture um you know came into being ESB Enterprise service bus if I remember right right and then of course you have the data um you know which is on SQL databases or nosql databases SQL is fine you know nosql is is better for horizontal scaling and so on um but what microservices does is rather than you know kind of uh having this distinct uh front-end back-end and did it here right what you're going to do is you're going to use Services right like for example um you know we're all used to this whenever you know you're in an Enterprise uh typically you have some something called a single sign up so rather than doing it all ourselves right we relegate it or delegate it rather to a particular service right so we may delegate it to Google we may delegate to GitHub sign on depending on you know what and and one of the other popular um you know single sign island is like OCTA you know we use that in data stacks for example for you know getting a token that you can use throughout the session right um in fact um we manifest our data okay in uh in nosql as a rest service and that's exactly what we're going to be doing today okay so it's a very simple like maybe two or three services that you see today uh but you can definitely extrapolate it this uh you know to to uh you know basically be in a world of services okay so what the heck are microservices um a good friend of mine Martin Fowler who actually also lives in Boston you know I um every time I see the slide I I think of you know I should set up a lunch with him at some point but you know uh our lives have all gotten busy so hopefully I'll do that soon but uh a reminder for myself but but basically he enunciated a number of these principles um you know smart end points and dumb pipes and even that is changing uh sometimes the pipes are also intelligent in such a way that they can Route traffic to these different nodes right it's really a um organized on business capabilities and we'll see shortly there is something called a shared nothing architecture and what do you mean by shared nothing architecture you know um basically you know again go back to kind of thinking about like SSO you know like OCTA like a GitHub single sign-on or like a Facebook single Center or whatever it's called these as metal single sign-on right uh you should be able to kind of um the service should do everything that is required for that particular objective and nothing more than that you know something along those lines right um a lot of things are are kind of something that's you know revolutionizing um uh the way Enterprises are working today uh it's all about infrastructure automation there is something called as uh you know immutable infrastructure right where you bring up infrastructure every time new uh you know every time you install something right and and the idea is that you want to deploy these Services you know as and when you want it and to be able to do that entirely by Automation in fact you know one of my uh you know I uh I basically uh you know learned about automation recently uh where you can use something called as a depend about on GitHub and depend about does a great job what it does is you know it goes out tries to find the maven uh um you know repository and see if the jar files have changed and it's going to automatically build things for you and that is how we noticed that there was one problem with one of our Java drivers and we are kind of working through that so so the idea is that you know once you automate uh it's it becomes easy to deploy and once you deploy them as individual units it becomes easy to scale so that you can you know you can you can uh meet the Demand right think about loose coupling that's really what it comes down to I mean you don't have to talk about microservices but you can still do loose coupling uh you know in different ways okay what are the advantages cost reduction uh risk reduction because you know you know that uh and then also there is this thing about two Pizza teams right um and and this is really more of a cultural thing than a technology thing uh where you know let's say uh you know a few of us are very comfortable with the nosql solution um in in another team you know which is a team of eight or team of six or whatever right uh they are more comfortable with SQL um so you can kind of mix and match these services to kind of take advantage of the strengths of that particular teams as well but we know there is no silver bulletin software right uh if that was the case I would take everything today and move it to microservices right not possible you know you know I I in fact have had conversations with a lot of companies who actually have gone to microservices and gone back because they just are not able to deal with the complexity right so make sure your cultural changes are happening at the same time as your technology changes and so on and I can I can talk adnisium about this but share nothing in real life right um again you know it do you really install a separate DB for each service maybe you do right but the idea is that you know if you can if you can kind of again leverage the strengths of the teams um I think I think that'll be great okay share nothing my third two I no I share a lot you know uh if yeah come on compromises all the way there are two things you know um one of the biggest Cassandra is that you know like I said before uh it's scalability and so on and so forth right um but you know um I I don't know if you're gonna talk about the cap theorem here uh but you might have heard of the cap theorem and essentially what the captain of state says is you know if you have three properties uh consistency availability in Partition tolerance you can pick only two of them right so there is this concept of what is referred to as eventual consistency where I may not be on top of the leaderboard for a certain like 15 milliseconds or 15 seconds or maybe even 15 minutes right 15 minutes probably too much right uh but eventually the the system will get to a consistent State um again uh one of my good friends Gregor hope uh if you want to Google and look for him he wrote a great paper this was a long time back um you know that Starbucks doesn't do um what is a two-phase protocol two-phase commit protocol and and if you think about how Starbucks works and many of the coffee shops around the world work you know basically they write your name somewhere right uh and and you know and and basically what's your preference uh and and put it off somewhere uh so the coffee comes to you take the coffee and you're like oh shh this is not what I ordered uh you you know all that they do is they throw it out and and you know correct it right and if you think about distributed systems there is a lot of parallels to that right you can you can you can do what is called as a uh compensating transactions so essentially you don't need to have asset or very strict acid atomicity consistency isolation and durability you can also do what is referred to as base or eventual consistency there is a soft State um but you are primarily thinking about availability right you really want it to be available available uh because again in today's day in life uh you know if something takes a little bit longer to load I'm I'm checked out right so so it's kind of a compromise between acid and base okay um I think I've I've talked quite a bit about this but again you know it's about share nothing data isolation if you know a partition key it goes to that particular node and no other node unless the node is down and and you know I think I think uh you know it's a great um you know Synergy between reactive programs and responsive data which is where Cassandra shines so I think it's a great infrastructure from microservices in general um and I've been beaten that to death um so before we jump to the first lab and and I'm gonna stop talking at this point uh Stefano anything else to add any questions that we need to answer or uh well there is just a point uh well one point is about there has been a question in the chat about comparison uh between Cassandra and mongodb and um of course this question comes up a lot and uh well I I have to disappoint Kevin because actually we had the first week of this boot camp entirely around a Cassandra itself and in with also comparison to adrenal SQL database in passing of course we would go a bit off our topic for today if we start this direction um well a big difference there are a lot of big differences and actually I don't even know where to start maybe I live for someone in the chat to to expand on this but a big difference is how the distributed distributed data principle is is pursued to its uh natural all node being equal uh final decision in the Cassandra architecture which is something that is maybe not unique to Cassandra but it is a distinguishing feature compared to um the red the other is the the choice to be a role oriented storage but this is there there are a few more and well yeah I posted a link to to the to the live recording of two weeks ago so week one introduction to Cassandra where there is a lot more on the internals and then structure and how do you approach using Cassandra uh Unfortunately today we really have to move on uh maybe we have music we might maybe make it yeah so I think for now we should move on uh of course I would like to ask maybe Cedric or someone in the chat to provide a bit more context to to Kevin so we can in the meantime we can start with the with the rest of today sorry about that but really that would lead us a bit off okay um okay so um this is my screen and I am going to well let's move to next slide of course that is first part of the live but before doing that uh now speaking about Cassandra and uh well you might be new to Cassandra especially if you didn't uh if you didn't attend the previous sessions but well that's the perfect time to mention a very important thing um in a couple of months from now there will be finally uh in person very big meeting the Cassandra Summit in Jose California and whether you are new to Cassandra or you are an experienced user or developer who uses Cassandra that is a very good way to uh to meet actually finally in person in a big celebration of Cassandra where uh well there will be a lot of technical talks on all sides of Cassandra there will be a learning tracks specific to developing and with Cassandra and other other topics and it would be a chance to to to gather back with the whole Cassandra Community whether it's the first time or not so we will have a slide later for about that but something that I would like to remind you already is that you are still on time to uh to go to the Cassandra Summit website and register and if you do that within I think a few days within the week or so you will still be able to uh to use the early bird lower registration fee now we will give another reference to that later so maybe it's time for me to move on and we are at the first part of the practice for today first there was also something in in the chat about okay no and that's all good thank you Aaron we who for having quickly come up with a very short primer on the differences  versus Cassandra and we can move to the practice okay so bear with me first time first thing so the goal for today is for you to have a running API backed by Cassandra's persistence uh storage layer to do that first you need a database so Cassandra comes in many forms and shapes and you could fire you could start your own cluster in your machine or whatever but today we want to make it easier for everyone so we have uh we can use something called astrodb which is a database in the cloud as a service in built in a serverless way on top of Apache Cassandra so um what I suggest is first I'm giving you the the link to the guitar repo that's appearing in the YouTube chat momentarily and there is a whole GitHub repository you actually have it also in the YouTube video description and that's it so this is the repository I mentioned earlier with all instructions for you to go through it and set everything up and run inspect your code and run the API and the sample code connecting to Cassandra all of this makes use of Astrid b as the Practical database used which is uh you can treat it as a flavor or Cassandra as far as protocol and communication with it is concerned so let's start by creating the database and as you saw here making sure the the the reference tables are there and are populated with the sample data uh okay so the first thing to go to do is you see this big maybe apart from the beginning okay here you see there is a bit of context and that's something we can skip today because we are we already gave instructions to you so there is this big orange button here create asteroid B so the first step is to create your database here uh that this button would leave would bring you here to this registration form you can create an account with your name and password or Google or GitHub directly single sign-on and in any case I want to stress that there is a free tier which is what you are going to use today so there's no of course this is all for free and the free tier is keep giving you actually a pretty big affordance a monthly credit that is enough to run not only just you know test applications but also actually a small scale production workload both for storage and and throughput so we we are going to use the free tier today so here if you register here you will be then be able to um to get to this page so I will give you a bit a few minutes to set up your account and you will end up with uh in a in an interface like this one which is the interface for Astra in particular I'm looking I'm thinking of so I'm looking at the product called astrodb which is the databases service that is part of a wider suit of products and you see I'm going intentionally a bit slow to allow you to finish your setup let's say once you are in data Stacks Astra you will see here there is a database databases uh entry in the left hand navigation bar of course this will be empty right because you just have an account like I do and now it's time to create a database now I was I prepared the readme in this form to have it handy so let's scroll down we are creating a database that will be hosting the sample data for today's application and there are tips here to call the database workshops and the keyspace sensor data now while we wait for everyone to set up their account and get to these screen I'll spend 20 seconds with a small introduction the whole bootcamp is built on a sample on an example application an example data model which is an iot sensor collecting application so there are networks of sensors for temperature or whatever and they will they will collect data periodically and write them to the to some tables in the database there will be a few later but okay there's no need now to know much of the details and that was covered mostly in this last week about data modeling but the point is that we need to not only create a database but also create initial tables and data in them so that the API and the the code later will have something to read right so first let's create a database now something that was mentioned quickly is that Cassandra is based on tables so it it keeps data in tables tables have columns like the usual this is very much like the usual relational database of course this is just part of the story otherwise it wouldn't be no SQL database as is it called uh the point is that the point is that we um okay these tables belong to the a single uh business domain in a single application in this case and we are going to keep them grouped together in what is called a key space this is why this is why in destruction tell you to give to to create a database and when you create a database you also create a key space that's just a grouping of tables a logical partitioning of tables inside your wider in general wider database so let me create a database you see there is a nice button here create database I'm clicking on it and as instructed by the GitHub instructions I'm calling the database workshops and the key space sensor underscore data now and this is I tried I tried to make it larger for everyone to see but okay so that would scramble a bit the UI if I make everything too big so uh to create the database we need a name a key space name and then you can have the database in principle you can have it created in every in any of these three providers to something that is available to newly created accounts in in the free tier is gcp so please stick with Google cloud and uh well I'm selecting any region like North America and there are some regions that are available some that aren't yet that's because your account is fresh and new and that's where I'm clicking on one without the locker icon so to to summarize database name keyspace name and then you choose provider gcp Google Cloud then error and a region with has which has no lock so if you create database here that's all it takes now I I made it very long because I wanted to make sure everyone was with me and I wanted to to very clearly show the process but actually from you you can get your database up and running from from nothing to to the database there in a couple of minutes that's what's happening that that is what is happening right now so while we are speaking my database and probably yours as well okay I see in the chat someone is the complaints it asks for credit card details uh that's actually probably not true unless you went to different Cloud providers or other regions so if you stick to Google cloud and and choose a region that has no lock icons that should not ask for any data any credit card no Stefano there is another question from Kevin from Toronto originally from Bangalore uh what is the what is the key space name you want to take it yeah key space name is here sensor underscore data you see it in the readme in the in the GitHub it may be more of a question of what is a key space I don't know if you talked about that right um okay okay yes I did I did but anyway just to to mention just to remind you while we are waiting for everyone to have their database the the database is the biggest thing and it contains tables but to to keep everything in order to keep sorting and and a bit of bookkeeping basically uh Cassandra has this notion of key spaces which are groups of tables and the the the meaning is that usually your one application will have will need several tables and for a given application you will probably keep all tables grouped into a single keyspace now there are exceptions for more advanced usages but think of that like one application one key space so Bush and used Azure okay you know you can you you're welcome to use anything you want yes you know those will require a credit card though okay and and yeah so if you want to just get started today without having to enter any details you should go for a Google cloud provider and make sure you pick a region which has no lock icon that would just go just work no no no data asked because that's yeah I think Kevin Kevin said sorry go ahead that's what the free tier affords I think Kevin said uh you know it's a logical group of tables it's really exactly right you know so yeah yeah it is well there is a bit more there is something there are things that you define at Key Space level but not today there is more to say of course and there is also a question about key space is matching partitioning well that's not true because partitioning happens within every table on a row by row on a group so rows are distributed according to partitioning while the key Space is really a much higher level grouping it's tables being kept together logically regardless of where they are where the role of the rows of data are so every key space contains tables every table contains rows and this rows are groupwise distributed over the nodes of your cluster okay thank you Cedric for having answered so I can go on so um while we were speaking you see my database is now active now that's probably something that happened to you as well and I please I I ask you to give me a thumbs up in the YouTube chat just to make sure you got to this point where the the database is active you will notice that while the database is active you are also given something called token you see there is here something called token now this would be a database specific token that will be basically needed to authenticate when you access your database because it's there in the cloud and you don't want everyone to have the keys to your database so these are the keys to your database and you should keep them for yourself now this would be a valid token for basic operations on the database but today we are going to be need we are going to need a slightly more powerful token uh that's because of the automation to have everything in the labs work seamlessly with uh with so very swiftly so I urge you to just ignore this token for today we are going to create a more powerful token in a second so don't do what I do but I do what I say right so in other words yeah if you if you go by the principle of public security um you really want to use a token that has the list privilege but you know just to make it easier for us we will yeah and that would be it this would be it yes thank you right so we today we want to make it possible to do more coding more running applications and less set up in a sense so we just forget about this token and reach a bit the the so this is not a production application of course so we can just go there and create a powerful token to fully exploit the automation okay great chat in there um you know basically it's free forever you know or at least as as long as forever is there right and uh um you can do 80 million queries a month you know you can run some significantly um you know heavy production loads uh and you get it 25 per month credit for which you can do like you know what sir Rick is saying uh 80 million queries and a lot of things like that um and and you know it keeps going uh if you don't use the 25 you know you reset and start again next month um so so that's kind of how it works yeah okay um you know quota issues or anything like that so 25 per month free you know is is fantastic but this is really a fully serverless deployment so this is managed for you and in a fully serverless way so it can scale down to zero or near zero if you have low traffic which is what uh makes it possible to basically offer uh any number of databases for free for for evaluation with this pretty generous three-tier level of quota storage and throughput which is not bad okay so let's assume your database is now active as mine is did you um you know talk about if you already created a database you can you know like workshops you can you can just add a key space yes okay yeah so let me let okay let me go to database for those of you who already created your workshops database so I clicked on the go to database and this is now where I am of course you can access your database anytime in this with this left hand side uh navigation button and there is here is my workshops so if I click on workshops I'm seeing my own database of course this is all brand new all zero fresh but maybe for some of you this isn't because some of you might already have created a workshops database and probably with the sensor data key spaces because that's the same key space as in last weeks in case you have workshops that you don't have this key space you can always add the key space no problem you can add any number of key spaces as you want so please stick to the name sir data is here because that makes the what we are going to run just run easier so I will assume everyone now has a database called workshops with us any issues you know usually it means that you have picked the wrong cloud or the wrong uh region so just Mouse corner and Google is the free tier one we are trying to you know basically do some cost cutting and that's the reason why we're doing this in our previous workshops you could pick anything really you know you know previous when I say previous I mean yeah um but but just make sure yeah using the Google um cloud and the mocks corner and if you're still running into issues feel free to jump in chat and we'll help you yeah indeed Okay so it's time to create a token uh token with enough permission for the later automation to work so how do you create a token now you see these settings here the settings part here on the lower left of the navigation bar click on these settings here I hope you can see it it's next to it's between the two of us in the in your YouTube feed so I'm clicking the the settings part right here if you can see it I'm clicking on it and that leads me to a management page and you see there is a token management here if you go to token management you can create tokens now uh tokens come in various with various levels of permission as a as we mentioned already there there is uh you can give you can create tokens that are more or less powerful so to speak today we need a database administrator token so there is a nice drop down here where you select a role and please make sure you choose the database administrator role here you see uh this is all detailed and spelled out in the GitHub readme so don't worry if you get lost just head over there and follow the steps everything is really really clear to follow we went through probably 1 billion iterations of the instructions to make sure there is as little friction as possible for everyone so just trust it will be very easy to follow if you ever get behind or anything okay not seeing settings on the left side great that's probably because you have a different user interface the so-called yeah so you probably have an interface that looks more or less even a second like these so uh Joy if your interface looks like this then you can go I hope you are yeah you eat different silence code are the same so if you have this UI please check your current organization here and you will see a menu here a drop down with organization settings yes so very good thank you for asking uh on the on the upper left there is this drop down menu with your organization and at the bottom there is organization settings these is where you go to the same Pages before so that's great because now we are we are back to business token management you see and generate a topic database administrator role okay or you can switch to the new UI but I I hope I showed uh I showed the way for both a kind of UI yeah we are somehow in the middle of a transition to a new Slicker UI and of course we have all kinds of combinations yeah care to take yeah combinations okay so I'm finally ready to generate a token so let me click on generate token now this token has been generated and that's very important to keep this of course I'm showing you my token because I have to but I may rest assured I will delete it once we are done because of course that would be a security breach in other words keep your token for yourself please because that's your thing and that's a secret that grants uh everyone access to sorry that's great that grants everyone access to um your database so I'm I'm bringing up any text editor just because today I'm keeping my token here for I'm going to use it later and you all you will be too so the token is made by three parts it's composed of three parts something called client ID client secret and token you can also download it in a CSV format so this is just ephemeral for me so I'm going to copy everything actually the important part is the third part the so-called token proper the one that starts I hope you can see it I try to make it bigger somehow the one that starts with Astro CS here this is the token proper this is a string that is everything we need today to authenticate with your database of course yours will be different and I'm keeping this string ready for later and later is very soon actually we will soon be giving the string to a 3D automation to set up access to your database okay so please let me know if you get to the point of creating and copying the token in a place for later usage and I think this part of the practice stops here so please uh okay someone is someone managed to get the point of having the token right I think okay so we're doing pretty good yeah um okay I think there was a question of course can we talk about the different uis you know uh and I think it was answered by Akram Ahmad you know if specifically you're referring to the Astra UI you can click and get the new UI if you want but if you're talking about yeah let me we can talk about that too you know we have uh how you can do that with swift we have examples with Warden you know again if you go just look at our um you know YouTube repository we have a whole bunch of those about different units yes anyway in the in this very moment I'm showing how to switch from the old UI to the new UI and that's in your upper right corner drop down menu but anyway thank you thank you Akram for doing it in the chat um you know this is how we kind of help each other yeah yeah okay so thank you I think this is now time to go back to the slides and there we are so I'm going to resume the the presentation from here with so okay we created the database and we created oh no wait we have to create the schema and populate the tables that's very important otherwise what what can we do with no data in our database come on and nobody was I should have told you okay so we are here in Astra I have no I have my token and now it's time to head back to the repository so I'm taking keeping this a bit it's wider so we can keep it here okay so uh we went through the create Astrid B we went to the administrator token and in case there are questions uh please ask in the chat so we can so I can move on other Rise you have the token keep it ready now we have to start gitbot now we already mentioned that gitbot is a very cool thing maybe I will let uh the the moving around I will let gitbot speak by itself so you see this gitbot button in the repository open in gitbot so now I'm going to right open in new tab or middle click whatever I just want to keep the repo open as well so I open in a new tab now what happens well actually a lot because okay you might have to authenticate with gitbots for this to happen so you you will find a login with Git with GitHub model you just give it give it permission and now this is what's happening a lot of stuff right so you see this is all in your browser and but it looks like vs code right so actually what's happening is that within the gitpod uh machines the the instances uh a container is started for you which will run uh basically what is a vs code server and in your browser a UI is running which is connecting to it and offers you a Linux box with you see a file editor and file from the top hey Stephano this is a great time because I think rivik saw the UI that I saw which is which so do you want to mention that you know before um yeah okay so two things one is that let me uh you might see this is spelled out in the in the report you might see a dialogue about opening this works page in vs code to desktop and you can just forget and close this model and I think that's it uh the wise you might be uh you might be no this is where it asked me right you know which yeah so let me let me fetch it so you might be seeing something like these let me bring that in Focus something like this if you're seeing something like this you should paste the URL to the repo here and choose this option contacts URL and editor that should be okay vs code in the browser should be good and the rest you should I guess you're okay with leaving everything default uh this is there is a bit of a unpredictable I think there is some kind of a b testing by gitbot at this point so that might be it I I'm not sure but anyway if you if you have paste explicitly the full URL to your Tor Repository choose vs code latest version in the browser and just you could you could try intelligence and that should be you know if it works but but I would I would just stick with um you know the vs code um I think one of the cool things about gitpart is it's so configurable uh and and you know you don't have to do instruct you know installs yourself uh because all of that is set up and and perhaps the most uh important thing from a workshop perspective is you can take this home you can keep playing with it for as long as you want and it doesn't get deleted until I mean unless you haven't used it for like a week or so something like that so while we are speaking I'm making the console font a bit bigger for easier display in in your maybe too much but let's see how it works maybe that's good enough well it might be clunky but at least you see everything that I'm typing and maybe the editor not particular needs so okay that should not be needed for you just for me to make it so yeah David has a question uh yeah go ahead yes yes you can you can you can work locally you can do everything locally uh you might have to that you might have to install a few things uh as like the Astra CLI so we are not we don't have time to to give instructions specific to running locally but of course this is something you should do if you if you prefer to work locally and it you just have to inspect the git for the yaml file which by the way is here in in the in the repository itself and it just does a it just installs a couple of things you can work from here since like you know what you're doing so if you look at what happens in the git for the ammo you will find out what you have to install and prepare for you it's like for example we take it for granted slash workspace exactly slash Workshop Cassandra application development as you can see there um so you have to adjust some of those yeah so you you can yeah you can definitely run locally but you have to to to adjust a few things for you for yourself so that's why well that's one of the advantages of gitbot right it offers a fully uniform workspace and we don't have to spend time after each individual snowflake laptop of all of you so we are just on the same page here and that's all we are going to talk about locals David uh if that answered your question please put us let us know in the chat yeah and of course if if you meet problems of course we are uh we can help maybe here if there's time but probably on Discord anytime so we the discussion on Discord stay there for good so please don't hesitate okay so um okay so gitbot comes with Astra CLI installed and which will be the tool for us to speed up set up well not that there is much to do but still you remember the token we created the DB administrator token well it's time to give it so I'm trying maybe I can reconfigure my okay let's see okay maybe I can switch the tab here sorry about that but I can yeah so that should make everything easier to do so okay we are here configure the aster CLI okay so if I run uh this is really big okay let's try like this if I run Astra setup set up Astra CLI is this Astra program it is installed already and I just have to provide my token here so this is what you should do I go ahead and fetch my Astro CS string copy and I I'm pasting it here now if I hit enter that's it I just set up my Astra is my Astra CLI to be let's say configured to use my own database that's all that is needed as a proof I can do Astra DB list now and it will use the token to administer it to access the so-called devops API have a list of well that's not very well formatted yeah now now there we are I will later resize the two consoles you see I have one database with these and these properties status active and whatnot and I also do Astra DB get workshops to to get more details on this one database so you see the default key space creation time a lot of things so this is just to confirm that Astra is configured and the token is valid and makes it possible to programmatically act on the database somebody who claims that Astra CLI is slick I'm not quite sure who it is oh some someone called Cedric who knows okay can you uh can you up test to see again uh text sorry yes you mean the repo here Astra setup so all the commands are here I'm pasting in the YouTube I'm pasting on YouTube the step we are at okay so if yeah said Ricky if I do the font bigger oh maybe that might yeah that might work thank you okay great okay so we have we are here Astra setup then just as a test I I showed us through DB commands there are a lot of them so you can do Astra help and you will see how many things are there now uh what I was saying is that Astra is very handily connected to your database which makes it very quick to uh well maybe we can skip this one I can just launch the initialization script so this is the command after the SQL sh workshops and then execute this file now let me just paste it in here after DB that means run SQL sh connect it to my database on and database workshops and please run directly the in the initialize SQL script which while this runs I'm going to quickly show it's here and it's a series of SQL that is Cassandra query language commands that well they they make sure you you get to this point with the right shape of all tables so it's drop tables of course this is something we do because we know this is uh test kind of uh environment and creates tables you see okay most of these was discussed in the previous week about data modeling so um there is a table called networks there is a table called temperatures by Network and sensors by Network and temperatures by sensors each has some columns some of them make the the primary key ins within the primary key a subset of column is the so-called partition key which to come back to a question that was there uh has to do with how the data for a table is partitioned across the Clusters can you increase um there is no time to get on guitar yeah but that's that's already pretty big I think but I can I can try I'm afraid just that we'll be not um much to to show let's try 22 I don't know more I think more would just not make okay maybe that's good enough much better so there are tables being created and after the tables are created there are also a bunch of insert statements you see a lot of them we don't need to occur now but that's just to to to make sure we have tables and tables there are some rows there is data to read to later read that's just it okay basically it's basically it's kind of this simulation of the sensor data right you know you can you can imagine this kind of streaming through uh and and Cassandra can just handle it without you know any issues yes so uh there is all the writing part of this application is uh is uh mocked so we just have tables with data and we test an application that makes it possible to read the data in various ways more on that very quickly later but the point is that I just run the code to the the instructor Aster CLI instruction to run this script so I'm pretty sure my database now has tables and in the tables there are there is the data I expect so you see network forestnet and sensor 1003 at the given time was reading a temperature of 101.5 and it is at this latitude and longitude this is the kind of data we have in these tables uh more on that later when we are reading that through code so this is now just a script uh I'm closing it because that might be confusing at this point okay so we can run some queries if you want maybe very quickly and run I can ask Astra to just open a SQL sh which is the Cassandra shell to to run directly run commands manually I can ask SQL sh to connect me to my database in a secure shell which is again a console specific to I can do use sensor data to to go to my own database oh I was there already anyway so you see there are some sample queries here I'm not spending much time on those but maybe just so you know let's say I want to read uh I want to read the bunch of data for a given Network and a given time range this is how it it works so I can paste this query and there are the results and by the way by the way I know this is something carried away with the astrocli but we should mention the dashboard right uh in in other words the Astro dashboard so if some of you you know some of your colleagues or data scientists and are not comfortable with using the um you know the CLI you can still kind of do that I mean you still have to know SQL which is our Cassandra query language which is very similar to SQL but you can go into SQL console which is great and and kind of play with it yeah yeah and that would be it here yeah so it's an in-browser version of this console which directly connects you to yeah the same database but I'm not doing that now anyway this is just to show that you can run queries and well predictably what you get back is portions of table with some rows and some columns that's more or less the general idea of the queries of course this was covered more in detail uh last week so I'm just exiting here and getting ready to for the next steps of today's practice anyway all of these areas and what to do and how to run them is spelled out in the repo so you are encouraged to to spend some time and inspect the script and and play with the queries run them and so on but now we we today it's about application development so let's move on and make these make the needed secrets and connection parameters available to the application we are about to run and that's where the Astra CLI automation is very handy because instead of having to manually gather addresses connection parameters and a lot of small things you can just run this command and ask Astra CLI to create a DOT time file which is there has been just created and it actually contains much more than we need today but this is a comprehensive list of all secrets and connection parameters you will ever need to connect to your database in all ways you see there by the way if you're curious you can also uh there are also graphql waves and and rest API ways to connect to your database and this is thanks to a layer plugged on top of Cassandra called Stargate we are not going to use it today except in the triggers it acts as a proxy for SQL and pass through SQL kind of thing but if you're more familiar or well actually we are going to speak a bit about other API paradigms so let me just skip this the main point is that this asteroid B created attempt has just created this this file I mean if you prefer to avoid that you can also make it manually I think but that's yeah so we can just I mean the important thing is that we have a token here and we have a secure bundle here which is a file containing additional protein and proxy information and some certificates for the secure connection TLS connection to your own individual instance of the database that's it that's all been done for you so basically this amp is there and what you can do is to Source it if you want and make sure or there is there is an instruction to just check uh that everything works if you run this you will probably just see that there is also a zip file this is something you in other without the aster CLI you could download manually and just make it available to the drivers it contains necessary information to connect to your database but that's all done but for you by the after CLI so I with the setup we are done I hope most of you could follow and and get to this point with me so please if you give me a thumbs up if you got the CLI to do this work for you and if you got to the point of having the dot I have created and ready to use that would be great okay so that's good job well done John well done well done okay so I think we can move on I'm trying to spell that I may pronounce that cool she's here Ryan welcome back maybe it's nice to see Ryan back in here oh yeah nice okay so um let's move on rest apis okay Ryan nice to see you Ryan you see the new branding of the slides by the way okay so uh let's go through this part pretty quickly okay maybe cheat 987 you I I might ask someone to chat to assist you so I can proceed well there's not much to say but something I briefly meant to uh today we're going to write uh to run a rest API but before diving into the rest API maybe one minute on the several on other alternative ways of writing of uh in constructing and designing apis just mentioning there is something called grpc so there are various ways for pros for for services to communicate right and each service has its own pros and cons and maybe they are more suited to different kinds of uh communication so there is something called grpc that's from Google and that's a very efficient way that however requires a bit more setup and is usually not much suited for a client to server communication it's more in general at least it's more like a server to server service to service kind of backend only thing anyway it goes through the definition of very strict schemaful structures and then that's compiled into code stops and then with the final goal of making the actual payload of communication as small as possible so if you aim for performance maybe at the expense of flexibility in a sense that's where you should go but uh there's also something called graphql that's graph query language that's um in a sense maybe maybe not anymore the new kid on the Block but that pretty recent addition to the API Paradigm family and that's uh very slick and it has its own applications where it shines it was well it is it has been adopted by more and more uh Services um GitHub for example to name one and the idea is that you have a single end point which exposes of schema of the full business domain that it covers and then these single endpoints can get queries where in the body of the query the full structure of what you want back is defined and then the client which has issued the request will get back exactly what it needs no more no less that's another that's a very uh powerful in a sense and very uh economical way of communicating between services and maybe more even more between applications and servers especially when it comes to low bandwidth uh and let's say limited conditions such as mobile networks and whatnot but today we're going to fall back in a sense let me say fall back not in a pejorative way to rest representational State transfer raise your hand if you've never seen a rest API in your life I think one probably should raise their hand because rest is the the grandfather of apis today in a sense it's the the I mean maybe not the grandfather but it is the most used API Paradigm the API architectural style the general idea is that you have several uh URLs each one corresponding more or less to a single to a different resource or entity whatever it is that the API exposes to the outside yeah come on okay so um the idea is that there are entities or resources and they are represented each one by a different URL so you see there might be different URLs for um sensors or measurements for networks and so on and through a series of different verbs basically the the crud operations are mapped to verbs so creation reading updates updates and deletions of entities of resources in a very general way are performed by verbs by HTTP verbs usually even though that's not strictly a specification of the rest well rest is not even a specification it's more a style of structuring your apis and it actually gives you a lot of leeway in how you implement the details even though there are of course idioms or best practice if you want like the kind the proper return code I just want to interrupt for a second is that you know in this particular case we have the example of to-do's and this was used in last year's boot camp and if we have time permitting you know we'll talk about this but basically this is what is referred to as the Swagger or the open API interface and this was for to Do's uh and if you go back to last year's boot camp um you know this is exactly the specification that we use because there is a to-do ecosystem there so if you want to go one step further you know you can try this out after your uh you know done with today um and uh kind of take a look at this and if you have some time we will talk about this but today we are going to using um we're using the sensor Network and you will see the corresponding rest apis yeah yeah so of course there is more and we hope at least to give a pointer for those of you who want to dig deeper So today we're going to implement a rest API in short um and well why maybe because we want to focus on how to connect with the drivers and to to the data layer which makes the rest part the API implementation part thinner of course rest as any other API has its pros and cons there are various various uh things to consider well rest might be best for to the couple client and server because you don't need in a sense you don't need to know the schema in advance you can just issue a query and look at what comes back which is of course a a good thing but also a bad thing in a sense rest makes it easy to handle versioning you can just have V2 alongside V1 in a very uh easy to handle way and being very established and respectable it has a very rich tooling and it is very mature of course there is a big tooling around that there is of on the other hand for example as opposed to graphql Rice does not come with its own uh discoverability mechanism even though there are of course uh racks just mentioned Swagger open API there are specifications to make a uniform way of describe what what you get from rest API what kind of structures you have to exchange with rest one might also remark that sometimes XML for sure but sometimes also Json might make communication a bit more verbose so might saturate bandwidth unnecessarily uh my personal uh point to add here is that sometimes you have a lot of calls to just achieve a thing what what is a single goal from the from the caller point of view so you have to go through different calls just to to perform what looks like a single operation and um I I think that there's probably yeah 100 years old more or less good good point Kevin that's not a bad thing in itself I mean it it really works well right so it is not going anywhere Kevin is one of those icky guys he's probably talking in binary terms there but but pointing in 100 years yeah maybe okay so basically the important point is is that rest is very well poised to it's the same shape of the crowd operation underline underneath which makes implementary easier in general in terms of levels of abstraction that are involved between the API and the underlying database which is one of the reasons why today we are going to stick with rest okay so now let's move on to what to do in the code finally so sensor application now this is something we touched already and I'm just showing that one second this is the data model for today no need to go into details but there are networks each one is com is made by several sensors and each sensor will in principle right always new measurements so there will be also uh entities called temperature measurements which come with a value and a timestamp that's more or less the idea of course this is just mentioned and an important part of the data model if you've been with us last week is that you first look at what your application should do and what kind of data it should retrieve in which order in which how is the flow through the application and this tells you how to to design your tables so this is now something that I'm just mentioning just to put a bit of context into what comes next the kind of queries that are that are going to be run but the point is that you shouldn't design the table and that's a property of Cassandra that's how you model data in Cassandra you shouldn't start creating the table unless you know first you should look into what kind of queries you want to run and then you design the table in the best way according to how the query will suit to which query you want to run so that's important because you see here there are queries such as find information about all networks or find raw measurements for a particular sensor on a specified date these are the queries these are the data access patterns that for the workflow through your application and then you create the table this has all been done for you you you remember to create table creation script so I'm just flashing by and today coming back to this three-tier uh sketch today we have a database that I guess now it's clear that is going to be the particular so it's going to be Cassandra but in particular it's going to be the database the astrodb instance you created the database is red and in principle could be written by the backend so the API which is going to be a rest API and this internally will use drivers as opposed to other ways of communicating as we just saw so and then there will be uh in principle of front end which today will be obviously just a command line HTTP request so there is no graphical stands today I mean we are focusing on on the up on the end on the API the part that actually speaks uh to the data basically we're argumenting the rest Services okay so drivers yeah yeah the middle part of this yeah so drivers well drivers uh there are drivers to connect to Cassandra in most of the major languages you see here today in particular we are focusing on Java Python and node but that's not uh the end of the list almost so more or less all drivers for Cassandra implement the same set of very Advanced features you see some of them listed here so they offer support for retries load balancing on the drive on the client side basically on the driver's side connection pooling authentication SSL awareness of partitioning so in a way that if you look for specific part of the table a specific partition of the table the drivers will know how the table is distributed across the nodes and will just go straight to the nodes that have the data so there are a lot of cool things in the driver so reactive API asynchronous you name it so there is basically these drivers are really built exactly to exploit all of the uh possibilities that Cassandra itself offers there is also something called object mapper that you probably most of you probably know what it is I'm just mentioning that for later if there is time rocks would like to show you something more but today first we will run something which has no object mapping and then maybe there will be something more okay so how do you install the drivers well that's just language dependent and it is not something that would surprise you so take oh come on this is okay sorry about that so in in part when you do a PP install in Maven in Java you you just add your dependency as instructed by the package instruction npm install I mean something really as you would expect so this is how we install the drivers and now the important thing when you start when you create a connection with with the drivers what you do in the code is you create a session a session which will keep the connection alive to your your data your Cassandra cluster right what you have to specify is at least one but possibly more I would say three contact points so sum And I stress just some of the notes that form the cluster you should provide let's say the IP address or the domain name then the drivers by themselves ask these in in this example there are two the drivers ask the two nodes hey who are your friends who what is the full shape of the cluster the the two notes know that because of the gossip protocol that um rugs mentioned and they answer back the driver and now the drivers has full knowledge of the full cluster and is able to root queries and to act uh to to end to enact a load balancing and to root queries to the right node by itself so this is it and that's a very slick thing right so when you create a connection with Cassandra in the drivers you just provide a couple let's say three the address of three notes for each cluster per each data center more precisely and the rest is automatic from there including and that's important including token aware routing so unless you explicitly turn this off oh every query will be rooted to the nodes that have the data you need or will need to the the nodes are responsible for that partition in the table so you you have the best the the highest uh optimization possible in this sense okay so this is just mentioning because you will see that in the code this is how you create the session nothing uh unexpected here right so I'm looking at the Java the Java example there is the SQL session builder in a fluent interface kind of thing you provide the addresses Port keyspace name Data Center and credentials and then bam you have your question you have your session or in the python case something very similar you create a so there's there is an object encoding the authentication you you create a cluster and then you you call the connect method by providing the key space and similarly in other languages so you end up with a session object uh now just think of course in case of Astra DB which is living in the cloud and it has a slightly more uh involved architecture you cannot just directly go to the nodes there is a lot of layers in between and there is the need for TLS secure communication and that's all handled for you by just providing this ZIP file I mentioned earlier so no question asked you just need bundle and credentials this is all this has been all handled for you by the dot ends creation by the way so not known no need to spend much time on this but the only thing is that instead of providing uh the IP address of your of your class of of a node in your cluster you just give this bundle and it will contain everything that's needed to it will just work magically for you so this is this is an example how you do that so you see this secured zip file I just provide in place of providing an IP address or more in general okay so no big points on this nothing that is not found on on the code itself so let me go on now the very important thing when you write your application be it an API or or a script whatever you should aim at having a single session object because that's stateful that will be uh that takes resources keeps sockets open so you should dispose of it when you close the application and when you want to free resources and it should be a single tone so you should not create more than one session in your in your code that's also because it is absolutely a thread safe so no problems pay special attention here because okay so let's show up in the mighty quiz I'm yeah wink wink okay so um so let's say we have you we have a session how do we run queries that's very simple you call the execute method that's very much the same in all in all languages and this method invocation will behind the scenes will run the queries and send the query to the server and start collecting results and do all kinds of things for you and then you will have uh in general and an object to iterate over and to read row by row what what came back uh so that's more or less the important thing of course you should avoid uh hard coding parameters in the string with the command itself and you should more aim at how you see here in the in this last example by passing placeholders and then a list of variables with the values but that's maybe explained by looking at the code uh just the detail you know that JavaScript has a very weak type system to say the least so uh in the particular case of JavaScript you should provide explicit type hints because the driver should encode variables in in the in the in in a typo format because the SQL protocol requires that so it needs to know whether you are sending an integer or a double or whatever so that's why you have to do that okay so that's if you look at the code you will find everything here um okay so now there is an important thing the concept of prepared statements what you saw earlier like this is just I'm just running a valid SQL statement with arguments so I'm reading rows and that's it so the this would be parsed and executed basically but in this case I am splitting this operation in two parts first I'm preparing a statement that means that I'm just asking the driver to parse the statement and check that each shape matches the table sort of type types the variables columns everything and that will that will create a something pre-cooked both on the cluster side and on the client side so that later when I call this execute if I execute the prepare statement everything will be faster because there will be no need to parse anything anymore and the types will be already checked and it will be just ready to be shot over the network so in particular if you're running statements several times as is usually the case if you're running the same statements just with a different argument for example you should definitely prepare your statements so you know if you prepare your meal from scratch versus you know kind of warming up something that you already have right you know that's that's kind of how I look at it yeah that's a good point yeah so this is something you can do in all languages now there is a different slightly different syntax no big deal uh by the way maybe it's a good time to mention you find uh you find all of the whole slide deck in the GitHub repository for later reference and you also find documentation on the drivers on on the net so don't no need to to to spend some time on this um so okay the prepare statements have the advantages I just mentioned so basically you save a network bandwidth and the validation of the metadata the validation of the types and the shape of the statement against the nature of the table is done only once and then everything is ready to just shoot the minimum over the network in subsequent calls that is the data set the data of the parameters and yeah so that's why prepared statements might save a a good chunk of time if you if you're running a lot of different statements yeah okay so time to move to the next part of the exercise so I'm going to uh gitbot again and we move on to at this point I'm moving to python so the next part of the practice is of course language specific so I choose the python part you see here and the first thing is this so this part of the practice will be into in two sections first we just run a couple of scripts to make sure everything runs as you can imagine second there will be an API to to run a small API that serves data from these tables so first I have to see the python and then uh this is python specific I want to install the requirements so there are just a couple of dependencies among which you see if I open the python directory there is these requirements and you see there is cassette driver of course plus other things but that's important that's where you install the driver says you so the next part is I can just run code so this very first script let me open it quickly this is just creating the connection so let me dismiss dialogues okay so this is just reading from a system table to make sure everything the connection works and you see there is this nice get session method this uh it is actually done once for all exercises in this separate module DB connection which well this basically loads the secrets from the the temp which is not so important but then here it creates a session and it creates a session much like you saw in the slides so cluster and then session equal cluster connect and then a return session now if you look closely this is structured in a way to implement a single tone that's because if I for some reason if I call get session repeatedly the code make sure that you just get the one and only session that the code creates and that's something that we just mentioned so let me run this uh connectivity small test so python x00 connectivity that should just work and if it does yes so it just tells me what is the data center what is the cluster name and nothing else so nothing interesting except it tests that my connection works so now something more interesting uh this is rating from one of the tables so let me just run it and then I'll quickly show the code python X1 query Q3 so this is running one of the queries in in the application workflow you see this is all sensors or a given Network you see for this network it is reading two rows and it is telling me some details of these rows so it's reading from a network table and if you look at the code well it creates a session and then it just runs this execute method and then it iterates over the results and prints some data right on it so nothing unexpected in a sense and that's what it does and now let me run a slightly different variant of this code one b okay so this is going to run and give the very same output except okay there is a different network but it runs in the same way but if you look at this x1b there is a big difference in that it uses preparesement you see in in this line I prepared the statement not giving the value of the network just the shape if you want to the syntactical shape of the statement this is already validated with the server and then I just run execute and I provide the network name as argument and the rest is the same so these two these two it's important to to to compare these two because the the 1B is let's say the way to go in a sense that's a bit more uh complicated if you want but this is the way to go if you are if you are for performance if you want to save uh avoid useless Network trips okay so that's it for running uh let's say Standalone exercises now it's time to run the API and that's very simple Okay so I'm using a fast API as a framework here nothing so this is a very minimal example of fast API application you see I create an API here and I attach just a couple of endpoints to it and inside the endpoints function I I have a session well there's there is the the very powerful dependency injection uh fast API technique but the point is that this is get DB session as usual the the the DB connection gets to to the endpoint function and then I just session execute something which is a prepare statement and I just return a Json with some data on it so if you allow me to just run the API this is I'm going to use uvicorn uvicorn API app that's just the API running the UV coordinates this asgi engine to power modern python API applications now you have noticed that I have two consoles now you see why on one console the API process is running and I can just make it smaller to allow for the other console to run my requests which is my client today so I'm going to use HTTP but if you like her you find curl instructions that's pretty much the same I'm hitting my locally running API with a get on on a on the endpoint sensor by Network and you see sensor by network is decent Point here here and it has a variable path parameter Network which is going to be the argument of the query that I'm running so let me run this request now this is this took a couple of seconds because it was the first time and and the session was lazily constructed so let me run it now okay that's much faster you see that's exactly what I get back yeah it works so you see I I I'm hitting my API with a request and I'm getting back a Json with all the things so this is a resting point I'm hitting a get verb on a on a on a given endpoint to get the old properties of a given sensor or or all sensor in a network sorry there is also another different request to run which is a post this time and there has been a bit of a discussion whether a post makes sense here okay so let me just run this this is a post but actually it is just a query data again just in a different way I'm having a I'm I'm asking for a list of all measurements by a given sensor on a given date and that's what it gets back so values and timestamps all good all nice and as far as the python part is concerned that is it now uh I know I have skipped some slides I'm selling I'm saying that to rocks as well but that's because I am looking at the time so the the technical stack involved I have just mentioned while we were running the exercise how the code is structured something similar and that's there's probably no time for go to this to go to this and sensor API we just run run in the API sending requests and looking at the code I've done that for the python case and I think I can stop here and give give it back to rugs maybe you can do a very quick tour of something let me do that and I'll promise to keep it really brief um okay so um you know hopefully you can see my good part session it's all set up and ready to go okay and what I have is the Java version here and you know uh I think Steph uh Stefano talked about the end points here let me see if I can increase the font a little bit um but but basically what you can see here is you can see the sensors by Network and you know some of the rest end points here as well um so so essentially this kind of does the same thing but now what it does is it invokes the Java driver for this right um so you know you can see here you prepare a statement here on line 52 and then what you do is you execute that prepared statement and then you get back at result set and do whatever you want with it right so kind of the same similar concepts with uh you know with the Java driver as well uh now if you want um you know again from a Java perspective or really from any language programmer perspective uh it's easier to deal with data as an object right I don't want to you know if it's Json or whatever format it is I am comfortable with objects okay and we haven't really I mean again it's a little bit of controversy of whether we want to introduce an object mapper uh in today's session uh and we did not um you know consciously did that because you know it might complicate the discussion a little bit but for those of you who are who are really interested you know you can go back to last last year's boot camp okay and I'm going to bring this up um so basically you can see here bootcamp full stack apps with Cassandra okay and it was week four and all that you need to do is go to github.com data science devs you can see here you know I'm kind of highlighting that right uh and here it shows the concept of an object mapper okay and that's essentially what it does it takes your data and Maps it into object as a programmer very easy for me to deal with this and this is a little bit different data model um you know different data I mean I shouldn't say a little bit it's completely different right it's a to-do item but again you know recordings for this are all available um and and you can just use the object mapper you know to essentially take your data and map it as an object and then as a Java programmer as whatever programmer right you know it's easier to deal with this and I think there was a discussion in the chat about uh orm you know object relational mapping this is not something new not fundamentally new yeah but but makes it a lot easier uh and and you can kind of walk through the code again all of these supported by the driver yeah and you can use this I don't think yeah except drugs except in this case it would be om because they this is that's Cassandra right no joins no relations there's no foreign Keys good point yeah but yeah but definitely the inspiration comes from orm you know day or dtos of course yeah yeah I'm joking okay uh let me turn it back to you that was a very very brief walkthrough of java I could have ran through the code but believe me it's exactly the same uh so not really a big deal but uh let me turn it back to Stefano because kind of running out of time here okay yeah so um okay so and we are wrapping up at this point and there is a question how come Cassandra is no sequel well there is there could be hours to to speak about that and indeed there have been that's why I I suggest you to well tune in because I'm sure we will run a new introduction to Cassandra an introduction to nosql Workshop soon we we run them now and then or you can look up in in our in our YouTube channel and you will see there are recordings of those so well uh very shortly how whatever the status of the nosql label because that might be also debate whether it makes sense to to use that as a label together Alex looking at you uh no sorry um Cassandra is definitely no SQL in that it goes beyond the relational Paradigm and it does that as the only performant way to support very big data that's the story if I have to to summarize it in one sentence of course there is much more and we can't go into detail now that's very sorry but we are already one minute past the mark so um you are encouraged to look closely at the code examples in this repo you are even more encouraged to come back at us with questions and even embarrassing questions we are we are glad to help you have your application run and maybe even more so please join us on the Discord we will give you a link later so I think it's really time to wrap up now and shall we try Rex did you manage to do something for the quiz oh was I supposed to was I supposed to be there no shall we try to run the quizzes is maybe let's see how it works okay so I hope you are still on the quiz let me uh back to these and again in the background I did not I didn't get the time oh not live I don't think it would have even worked to do that live so let's see how that works well okay so please join us for a couple of questions on what we saw today let me know please uh and give me one second because okay we are going to have a couple of questions on uh what we saw today this time you not only have to answer the correct answer to give the correct answer but you also should do it fast to win because there will be a leaderboard and faster answers will gain more points so let's see how how it goes um yeah you see the link is mentee.com and you the the code to enter is in the YouTube chat uh what I suggest is you don't look in the YouTube live for the questions because there is a slight delay so you better keep an eye on your own mentee page let's see shall we start and yeah let's give another half a minute or so of course uh what we said today was just a very quick introduction there are luckily we we provide a lot of more a lot of examples more complicated examples on writing apis connecting with the drivers also with other things than the drivers such as the cloud native apis to connect with Astrid B what we really would like for you is to yeah it's someone says it's not loading I think Timothy is really having a bad day so I'm not sure what could be done let's try shall we otherwise we just let's try so quick yeah this is this is floating well um so so let's see let's keep going let's hope but again I stress that this is a good example of uh okay no questions now a good example of yeah I think that's that's really something going on here in many but okay let's start question number one how many sqls SQL session object you should use in your application one per connected client one per application or as many as needed on there are no limits on the amount of memory my app can use so if you manage to see the question at least I have the I have the answers all the stuff you know that's good so yeah okay well one per application yeah so we we stress the fact that the session should be a single tone and this is there is a single session over all of your application so yeah the answer is one per application uh because now the application is your API for example and that will share a single session object and this is not about how the client connect to your API but this is about how your API speaks to the database and that's where the Singleton thing applies even though Europe your API might get requests from thousands of clients okay so we might take a note on this can be being a bit maybe isn't that the idea yeah maybe it uses a slippery language maybe who knows so Dragonite is the fastest but there are more questions coming so let's move on what happens number two you didn't play the game and to get more points maybe it just went came to say hi why should you prepare statements so prepare statements are required or you do that to speed up queries or to make sure they are ready for the send stage when you run a query or you properly to properly cook them for guests so why should you prepare statements time is almost up think about what we said and yes the answer is to speed up queries because you have to you can avoid sending all the whole metadata every time and you can avoid checking the schema and validating the types all every time that's great okay so it looks like we did a good job with this one and the fastest has been use Dragonites supplanted Lola but still Dragon not yet but lastest is jumping and climbing the ladder so question number three let's see three more to go number three answer fast and try to get to give the right answer drivers do drivers route a query to the right node yes if you tell them which node or yes automatically by themselves or no because each node has all data anyway or there is no way to have this smart routing oh this is a tough question this is a general question on drivers we mentioned that and let's see and the answer is yes by themselves so very great when the connection is established the drivers gain knowledge of the full cluster topology and with that also the routing partitioning scheme comes so they are able later to go to the right node for every query very good and and I think Adriana was the fastest and climbs at fifth position very good the Dragonite is still leading and this is now the last question [Music] answer fast and answer correct so one of the advantages of microservices is simpler architecture or easier to test or maybe decentralization or less CPU needed or maybe easier deployments let's see time's up okay so actually there were three good answers and it looks like most of you code got a right one yeah decentralization is one of the big advantages not not the only one of course that one in particular comes with also some needed changes in the in the in the company in the way the company works so less micromanaging probably usually and Dragonite wins congratulations Pingo and Thomas also well placed and well congratulations to all of you I hope you have uh learned enough today to get started and to further inspect what we started so your your application writing knowledge has just started if you haven't yet I suggest you go back to the other uh episodes of this of this um bootcamp because there is of course something more to learn about data modeling and also Cassandra General features there's actually a lot there but yeah congratulations because you are now at you finish the boot camp congratulations now let's move on I I remind you that you have a stability to further test your knowledge by doing an actual coding exercise that is adding a new endpoint to this so far skeletal API so the API you run whatever the language you can accommodate for a new endpoint corresponding to the query get all Networks and you can look at the data and dive back into what happens in in the code maybe go back to the data modeling part a bit and you will find out how to do and then you can submit the homework we would be happy to grade it and award you your badge so that would be the best way to reinforce your your newly acquired knowledge right okay so um that being said I want to remind you that you are not alone in your journey so we all get stuck sometimes especially in in writing code right so I remind happy to help you on our Discord data stats developers and this is the the link maybe we can also have it on the YouTube chat this card yes and not only that because we we routinely Patrol stack Overflow and DBA stack exchange if you take your question with Cassandra and even more if you follow that that tag you will stay up to date with what's going on in the Cassandra space so that's it and this is our Discord community so uh DTS xio slash Discord we are always there happy to help and that's not only about Cassandra but more in general about I would say everything data and data architecture data and programming related we are there to discuss happy to okay so uh there's a question how to open a second terminal in GitHub maybe I can quickly show that if this git but you see there is this plus button on my lower right it's a new terminal if I click this Plus there a new terminal and that would be pitch between them with this right hand side switcher or you can also split terminal and have another terminal alongside the other so you can play with these buttons on the lower right okay so I hope that helped now the important thing if you want to know more on Cassandra if you want to get
