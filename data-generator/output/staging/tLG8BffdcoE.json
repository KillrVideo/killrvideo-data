    "text": "hey everybody thanks for tuning in today we're going to have a quick look at all of the really nice things that spring boot provides to make it super easy to deploy applications on kubernetes and then we're going to take that app and hook it up to data stacks astra astra is a database as a service offering that's powered by apache cassandra if you want to take this home and get your hands on it yourself i recommend checking out this blog that i'm showing on the screen here it'll walk you through step-by-step full application stack going on your local laptop using spring cloud gateway spring boot spring data and also a cassandra operator called cass operator so before i kicked off this video i started a database in datastax astra so if we have a look at that what you see here is all of the things that you need to connect an application to the database and this is running in astra's free tier there's about 10 gigs of storage pretty small deployment here but it's good for demonstration purposes like this so we our key space name is better bots our user name is c underscore user and our password is c underscore pass and i'm mentioning that because i'll show how to load that those credentials in via a kubernetes secret the other thing we need here to connect our spring boot app is this secure connect bundle so i'll go ahead and download that to my local machine here and i also set up a small cluster in mini cube my local machine and we'll use that to go ahead and run this demo so flipping over quick to the app you'll see here that i only have a few dependencies i have the web starter the kubernetes config starter and actuator and then i'm also loading in the cassandra driver and swagger hub so that we can play with the rest api and then this is just one pojo application we have a product with an id name description price and a last updated timestamp we're going to use springrest to build our rest api you can see here that we're loading in these libraries that really abstract and remove most of the boilerplate that we'd otherwise have to write ourselves you can see here that we're building a very simple api for searching adding and deleting those products the other thing to point out is the product data access object this is where all of our database queries are defined i wrote out the cql but you can also use the java drivers object mapper or spring data and you can see here that the cql is very similar to what you would expect with sql we have our create table our insert statements our select statements and our delete statements so one of the really cool things that spring cloud kubernetes lets you do is load your settings directly via kubernetes config maps and so in this case we have this astra secure connect bundle setting which the path forward is app astra creds and that app astra creds corresponds to a volume that we're mounting will store that secure connect bundle that will load into a kubernetes secret we're also using these kubernetes secrets to store our database username and password and you can see here that we're setting those as environment variables that our application will take and use to configure our database connection here we have the username the password and then down here we're using this builder customizer hook to pass in the connect bundle and the auth credentials to the cassandra java driver so now let's actually take a look and run this thing to see just how easy it is with a few steps to get this thing up and running in kubernetes so we'll start by creating a namespace and then we will create a secret for our username and password again this is c user and cpass and then lastly we will load in that secure connect bundle that we downloaded from the ui and just to make sure that all of this landed in kubernetes we can go ahead and describe the secrets and we see here that we have both the secure connect bundle and we have our db secret username and password so that's really all we need to get up and going and deploy this thing so now i'll go ahead and deploy it and we'll take a look at the pods that were started you see this one running here for our spring boot service and then we can also have a look at the logs to make sure that everything is starting up as expected so it looks like here that everything is booting up for us i also showed before that we have a swagger hub ui configured for this so we'll hop over to that as the app boots and that is that 8083 swagger ui looks like the app isn't quite up yet now it is try that again oh that's why i forgot to forward the port so with this app we're using node port to expose access to our server to our service so we have to expose that port locally in order to connect to it typically you would use kubernetes ingress or something like the spring cloud gateway which this full demo does use and that can control your access to the cluster so we load up that swagger ui again and this time it looks like it's working we'll go ahead and take a look at that awesome so we have our product controller here and also my laptop is sounding like it's about to enter outer space at six years old so i'm glad it's just still sticking with me at this point but we'll go ahead and try out that endpoint that we created we'll execute that in swagger hub here and we see that we got a response 200 code which means it worked we'll also just enter one more json doc there to play with this and 200 code now if we go down to our search api try it out name that was mobile execute it and we see the two entries that we just submitted so just to make sure that these actually landed in astra we'll double check using this hosted cql console that they have log in got the credentials right the first time that never happens and boom we see those two rows inserted into astra so again i hope that showed that spring boot especially the spring cloud kubernetes library makes it really easy to get up and started with spring kubernetes and then with that public endpoint in astra it really makes it easy for applications to connect and the nice thing about spring cloud kubernetes is that we can store both the database credentials and that secure connect bundle in kubernetes secrets and use those in our application to connect to the database so i hope that was a helpful walkthrough again you can check out this blog post if you want to try this out locally and again astra is just astra.datas.com kick the tires it's pretty cool stuff and yeah thanks for watching bye",
