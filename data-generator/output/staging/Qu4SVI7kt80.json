    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems it's time again for another episode of the distributed data show I'm Jeff carpenter I am here with Kat Erickson well it's always good to welcome back familiar faces to the show and I remember the last time that we had you on you and I were talking about docker that's right so some things have happened since then with our release of official docker images for data sacks Enterprise and I think we're seeing some good pick up and adoption of those official images now you mentioned to me the many millions of downloads of unofficial versions so hopefully we're starting to put a dent in those metrics and catch up with some official downloads yeah excellent so one of the things that I teased our audience on last time that we wanted to talk more about I think when you start talking about docker containers let's face it you know I can run a couple docker containers on my machine or you know on an instance in in some cloud but really the whole point is that we begin to be able to do this at scale right which is where orchestration comes in but I don't want to define it for you because I want to ask you about that so let me get your definition of what is orchestration technology sure so I think what a lot of people think of orchestration technologies they're really just thinking about deploying containers but it's it's so much more I think service discovery is really one of the most valuable features if you think about deploying web front-ends which is the most popular use of kubernetes you can have five or five hundred depending on your web traffic and those pods can have a pretty short lifespan but new pods always need to be able to easily find the backend so we have these two things that always need to talk for the ice piece change their locations change and it quickly becomes pretty overwhelming to manage and so to solve this use services and service discovery and that's just DNS at a higher level of abstraction so pods can be created destroyed replaced and as long as you can find those applications and services they can always find each other but that's just scraping the service of what's available as kubernetes and some of the other players in the space mature you'll see automated upgrades failover and scaling available for staple applications like ours just as they are available for stateless applications today ok got you ok so I have already I have a number of things that I want to follow up on and dig deeper but let's start with this just to kind of paint with a broad brush here who are the major players in this orchestration space yeah there are three core technologies here you have kubernetes meso s-- and swarm kubernetes backed by the kubernetes community as well as by OpenShift most of the major clouds and other players like pivotal as well and vmware and then you have meso s-- which is backed by meso sphere offering DCOs and then you have swarm which is offered by docker as well excellent so there's a good ecosystem of different supporting technologies I think they compete on some things they share some technologies on some others so this is this is kind of a fun space to watch right now so I want to get more on the technical side of things with you now so you started talking about stateless services but you know there are some state full things that are still out there so can you help me unpack this a little bit like stateful running stateful versus stateless applications in an orchestration environment now I mentioned that orchestration technologies like kubernetes really became popular for stateless applications and these are applications that respond in the same way for the life of the application they never store any new information again for a URL will always have the same response and then you contrast that to steep apps like Cassandra or like data stacks and we store all the information that has changed since the application started running so we are storing new inserts to the database but we're also tracking who's made requests to the database and changes in the configuration so essentially we're maintaining its state gotcha okay so that's one of the things that I really love about you know service-oriented and then the emergence from that of micro service style architectures where that's that's kind of the mantra that you have drummed into you as an architect and a developer is like we want to have stateless services I should be able to call it and it shouldn't matter if any of my in different instances of that service get called but then that's that's all well and good but then now we get down to the data tier which is what you're talking about this is where are the actual state has to be stored somewhere and so it's actually down in the database and this is where it seems to me like things get a little bit more tricky when you're talking about these environments it really is but you know the new stack does a survey every year of kubernetes users and it's and its uses and what are the interesting responses this year was was to the question of what do you want to orchestrate and it was front-end web apps you know customer-facing applications and then the very next thing was the database and that's because the developers that are driving the adoption of these technologies they don't want to think about the database they don't want anything to complicate their development and so once the front ends are orchestrated it's the database that they want to see available next no it's okay so I'm just gonna push back because I think it's a little fun here to have these conversations so one of the things that I know about maintaining a Cassandra cluster is that adding a new node or even taking away nodes can be an expensive operation so because there's their streaming involved the you add a new node it's gonna want to take over a portion of the ring that you know the that exists in terms of how the data is distributed around the cluster so the other nodes once this new node comes on and figures out what it's gonna take over the other nodes need to stream the data that kind of belongs to that range so I don't want to be just I don't want to be automatically scaling up my cluster or all the time - I mean that's super expensive it's gonna bring everything to its knees yeah you're absolutely right you're not going to use all of the features I call them the allure of orchestration you're not gonna use everything that orchestrators can do for every technology you may not want automated failover so if you have a web front-end that fails sure deploy me another one right away but if you had a Cassandra know that failed it felt for a reason and you don't want to rejoin it to the cluster immediately you need to know what went wrong so you can use health checks to understand what's going on in your cluster but you may not react to it like you would with other applications I'll add that you know the cloud native foundation they own the kubernetes project they they have these guiding principles for cloud native apps that it has to be containerized it has to be dynamically managed so over time we'd love to see kubernetes or any of these orchestrators be able to take on any of these very advanced administrative tasks of stateful applications we're gonna have to take those on one at a time as the technology matures okay well that makes total sense like as long as we're not saying that we're just gonna totally dive into this and expect you know the the scheduler to understand everything about you know when it is that my node should be restarted or when it's just so messed up that I should give up and replace it with another node it's you know there's a lot of these things that that we might not we will get there eventually but right off the bat we may not know enough in order to be able to fully automate all of this and that's okay I agree with you I think there are a couple things that are really attractive to to database users right now if you think of Kassandra you think about linear scalability in adding nodes but we have some customers that are limited by the amount of data per node they're already running these very dense nodes and so what they need the ability to do is scale-up you may need to add extra CPUs and and DRAM for things like Black Friday orchestration environments and the management of configurations gives you the ability to do that and not only to do that but to rollback when that period of peak traffic is over so there are some really interesting value add propositions that our customers and users want to take advantage of now good so I like this I like this flow that we're on now so tell me a little bit more about how you actually see our customers using kubernetes in practice I really see two major uses the first is by customers and enterprises offering their own internal cloud environments and platforms as a service their internal users want to try out a new use case they want to be able to quickly stand up data sex cluster in three to five nodes with you know off center for management and they want to do that without thinking about pre racks without thinking about where do I have three servers sitting around they just want to quickly get that cluster up and running and then the second use case is for repeatable deployments of application stacks and this is what you hit on earlier with the micro services architectures so they want to build their application stack one time but then one of the value propositions of Cassandra is the geo replication so essentially they still need to deploy that application stack around the world and they want to do that in the most uniform and repeatable way that's possible and that's through an orchestration technology okay so I just want to be able to stamp that out in multiple data centers and and not have to do sort of a custom babysitting it spinning it up managing my my cloud formation scripts or whatever every single time but that's exactly it and you don't want to have to go through the the plumbing of the cloud providers so that your applications can see each other you need the service discovery piece to be there you need everything that's gonna make all the pieces of your application communicate to work out of the box that includes your ability to monitor them and see everything that's going on across the application in a single place okay gotcha so this is uh this seems like an area where there's a lot of innovation that's continually going on and you know I guess it could sort of spin off in any number of different directions led by different companies but really who's guiding the the maturation of this technology and and how the how you know what things are being held in common kind of across companies going forward right I think there are really two driving forces that I see the first is the user base you know the technology is is driven to innovate towards users needs but then you do have the cloud native foundation that I mentioned earlier that is guiding in terms of design principles you know these are the things that a cloud native technology should do this is you know it should be containerized it should be built around the idea of enabling micro services it should provide central health checks and the ability to to manage itself in some capacity over time so users drive the demand and and some of the innovation and then the cloud native foundation tries to set the policy and principles okay and I guess I've been thinking here maybe I was a little negative before in terms of my concerns about scaling clusters up and down but are there what I what I should ask is is if there are some possibilities for things that are enabled through organization technology that weren't possible before does this open up some new possibilities yeah let's let's stick with using kubernetes as the example kubernetes has the concept of auto scaling which is the example that you used but you may deploy using kubernetes on Prem or you may deploy using in a cloud and let's say that you're deploying to to Amazon you may be using their new kubernetes service or you may be using what you had developed on Prem and so the way that you would Auto scale on Prem is gonna be different in in Amazon because they have their own mechanism for auto scaling so you would have to adapt what you're doing to the way it's done in that cloud environment so while you're looking for uniformity and how you do these things the underlying infrastructure also drives how you develop that solution so you may you can build a trigger that says if I reach this capacity you know I need to add a node but you don't want to do that again like on Black Friday right or maybe you do I don't know maybe well maybe you do but hopefully you do it maybe you wanted to do it three days earlier the week before yeah so you only want to automate as much as as much as it's safe for your you space okay so you bring up an important point here about the cloud providers and and what their offerings are I think there's been a lot of announcements recently in this space do you want to kind of review some of that for us sure the most recent and I think what folks find the most exciting is the Amazon Elastic Cooper Daddy's container service I think it's eks was announced at KU bukan in in December and then you also have a sure this recently added kubernetes support so Ashur has Azure container service and that now supports DCOs docker swarm and now kubernetes as well we've seen other announcements recently you have the partnership with pivotal and VMware offering I think is Kubo as their kubernetes service and so you see of course Google's always been kubernetes pays for a Google container engine so you see all the major clouds at this point supporting kubernetes and then most of the clouds and platform as a service providers supporting a subset of the others gotcha so let's wrap things up here do you have any final words or any final wisdom to share with us I know that you're watching this space pretty intently so where is all this going what are the things that we should be looking out for in the orchestration technology world yeah I think I think we can say it's a really exciting emerging technology or some things it is mature and is ready to be used in production for other things it's mature enough to use in production for a subset of the uses like we hit on earlier where you may be able to deploy and manage a database but you may not want to turnover upgrades failover and scaling to kubernetes or an Orchestrator at this point so I think you have to really understand the technology and understand the fit between the solution that you're building and what the orchestrator offers good ok so it sounds like you know it's not an all-or-nothing kind of proposition you can sort of work your way into this gradually and then begin to trust the frameworks with a little bit more of the responsibility as their capabilities mature is that fair I think that's a very fair statement well thank you cat for joining us it's always a pleasure to have you on and to our listening audience we just want to thank you once again for watching this show and we do love to receive your feedback so we're interested to know are you using containers are you using our data stacks docker images have you tried orchestration frameworks and scaling up your database managing it through
