    "text": "we are live welcome to Jeff and Adrienne's c-sharp refactoring kill video puppies and cats that's right we're working on c-sharp services I'm looking at killer video comm which is our production deployment of our reference application I think this is running Java services for the Micra service here yeah you get the idea mm-hmm so we are working by the way did I show you this last time I verified that this updated the though that the dialed yeah yeah yeah so here we go web client web application is what I just showed you we have different implementations of the backend we were working on the c-sharp implementation right of the micro-services so last time we may we did I guess like a quick evaluation of the current status of the code base yep noting that the last commit was August 28 2018 so few days ago the one-year anniversary of our last commit that meant that we had sort of fallen down on keeping that up to date yeah so Tuesday you and I did an assessment and we came up with these five issues that we add into the C sharp services so we're gonna start working today so I can go whatever direction I've started I haven't made code changes but I well not really any Co changes of significance but I've been comments oh I mean I made a comment on my own yeah got it it's like someone already commented on this issue so I started investigating and doing some diagnostic work on this removed penance on that CD mm-hmm you were mentioning as we were talking before the call that we maybe some work on the update packages and project today so do you want to start there um so as it's the so we would branch again off of what you were working on or would we leave that CD changes where they are for now well I haven't really done it's not not a lot of significance here here's what I've done I can figure the the retry delay on the start off loop so that it fails faster and I added a logger a logging statement so it's not like a lot of work has been done I think we all right sorry so I'm on the remove sed branch yeah okay so um yeah let's do let's do that and see what we can get for updated packages so I think I think in here I I'm not entirely 100% sure how Visual Studio for Mac does it but I imagine like either you click you click on setting excuse me you click on settings for the project or individual packages and there should be an option or properties that would give us an option to update so I swear this so the thing is here I'm trying to get I'm I'm not awesome with the structure of this so here's the salute it's a killer video solution right and it nicely tells me my current branch so thank you thank you for that oh look at that huh all right good it does it so it does integrate with git I was struggling a little bit without before so it was probably just me okay so here's killer video I don't that's not really right so I need to go like to individual packages in here right yeah the packages directory and then I think right there yeah you could just hit update and see if it'll see what this fails okay I tried this before and it fails okay unable to find package ix - async existing packages must be restored before performing an installer update weird so this thing it appears that it doesn't know what this thing is that's entirely believable I hax async what what is it I won its unable to find it I wonder if it exists anymore I should be there it's it was last updated 318 days ago or well the previews and this is what vert whoa version 1 to 5 yeah that is Wow that's probably why I don't even yeah I don't even see that version in the new gate repo anymore okay do you think I should just remove that and try to add it um do that I have NuGet packages yeah go ahead and yeah do it do it this way and let's see if we can just add it as another dependency I acts - yeah they sync oh that makes it confusing it seems like a weird search algorithm to return all of these things that are not what I asked for yeah so another oh is this the I guess the other question is is this the interactive async library I'm kind of guessing it is I still can't believe we have such an old version because literally yeah cuz I look back at the old version here which is 3.00 and that's from 2016 hmm and the newest one 32.0 is a year plus a few weeks old it's pretty weird I just clicked on refresh but I don't know where to look for what happens when I do that I'm just refresh mean I'm not I'm not sure in the context of this ID you cannot date yeah me either so another thing that we could do I'm gonna pull up chat as you need is this link with the CLI command so you could theoretically open up a terminal in that repo zoom chat and oh yeah it's zoom chat I guess I should have sent it to you let's get to the zoom chat when I'm actually pre sharing my screen I don't I don't know because I haven't done and zoom yet okay so I sent it in slack too just in case do I have this dude at the command line I think it would work here yep should work there whoa bananas said a lot of stuff could not find any project is it in is it in the path of because everything a c-sharp Oh what's the it might be in the source directory I think yeah yeah so is that okay and then go into oh geez what project is that actually well there's a solution file right here yeah but the the dependencies will actually be stored in each individual project oh I'm still doing this anyway to watch it fail okay [Laughter] the project file ends operator is it ink oh these are some interesting organizational structures for this Oh killer video looks like it says it should have a package right it should it yes looks like the men that is the route yeah run it in that one cuz that's the route project anyway like the collector of all the other projects yeah yeah this project does not support adding packages reference package references through the add package I don't I don't I don't know honestly that's here I'm gonna I'm gonna try to deal with this via this JetBrains rider do I'm gonna put jetbrains rider on the screen for just a second yeah yeah oh so I found I found the packages oh it displays it in a completely different way oh maybe I'll just do that source list killer yeah prejudice that's poor okay so if I ahead package add a thing edit yeah this might be more of a challenge than originally oh dear on your list do you if you scroll down and look for the something-something link oh yeah there you go yes what's the system not linked yeah I was just looking it looked like some of our code might have references to multiple versions of that stuff which could be tumultuous ooh but it might have just been the writer IDE so I'm so I'm back at your screen package needs retargeting I hold that too I think if you right-click on it there might be an option yeah retarget did it just fix it didn't give you Oh weird I guess it found it usually that tells you like wait let's you point it at something and there's a packages config to it took some stuff out it did and added some stuff when I did that there was an actual change oh yeah yeah I'm just I'm just surprised that it found it I guess it looked in whatever the default directory is and did that oh and we have four six to that that all needs to change to dotnet core but that's here nor there at the moment oh this is it retargeted with warnings the is our warnings dispo final conflicts between different versions of the same dependently please set auto-generate bindings redirects property to truism projects he tell you to change the project that's so dangerous um oh because it's one of those things where like you change it but then the ide will go in and tweak stuff anyway oh and sometimes it doesn't pick up diffs so I think what I heard you say is that this is not a this is not a dotnet core based project and maybe it should be yeah we should definitely get it moved to that as soon as possible and it might just be some of the dependencies it might not be our part of the code specifically and I just feed ya tendencies which is what I guess because I whenever I've talked to Luke and ceedric about it they have included or used only dotnet core stuff when they're working on this so it might just be some rogue dependencies and they haven't caused a build issue before or something hmm but now yeah now that's so last year exactly hmm and moderately perplex how to use the Mac thing to do this but also like I opened it up in writer mm-hmm and yeah it shows a ton of dependencies and it shows some double dependencies like on multiple multiple versions of the same thing right which might be some of the confusion seems highly likely yeah it however does not have a update packages thing hmm but I'm looking to see what other options it has cuz we got yeah so we got killer video and then we got 8 million projects yeah because we have like video catalog user management uploads all that stuff which is different yeah different components what could be that the packages are listed as oh yeah writer is tripping out and wanting to move all sorts of stuff around what is it it's even saying yeah so maybe does it does it show the readme or anything else and that in that IDE no no so at least at least it shows the packages under the project yeah I'm like writer but I think both things are displaying things a bit weird because of our not conventional folder structure of our project got it okay okay comment ratings' yeah cuz like that is broken out by folder and then the projects are in the folder and then yeah like in writer I have that but then I have all of the packages for the entire all the repos and one thing it looks like in one folder list and I guess it's it's picking up that information from somewhere I don't know where it's driving that from so it sounds like that needs to be I don't know rebuilt in some way yeah I'm not sure the first step at the moment to do that specifically right well I almost wondering if it's like [Music] like creating a new project from scratch and like moving source into it it could very well worst-case scenario but yeah yes it does sound like that it also sounds like a very common thing that would be done with the dotnet project because then it forces the IDE or IDE s to remap everything according to where you actually put it and like I'm looking at the Ryder IDE I'm showing everybody else that on stream again and there's just there's tons of stuff where it's trying to look in reference from the project for default stuff like type string and it has red squigglies because it's it's not referenced correctly mmm and I'm trying to get that figured out because that that basic stuff should absolutely be found by default yeah strange navigate yeah like it wants me to generate code for a string object that's like no no no no c-sharp already has a string object oh yeah that isn't something good at all yeah so one thing I'm verifying right now is let's see I guess I can just do a dot and it's gonna do a dotnet version oh maybe it's dotnet - version net - - version so I got two - which isn't the latest but it's the one that I recall was being used to build this last time anyway so if I do where is that project file at is it in the source directory oh this there's the solution file okay yep broke and last time you were you were able to get that that IDE to build right yeah it runs it a project with the goood so I just ran the build and got an error and it failed huh and it is saying that there are two projects that aren't aren't mapped that it doesn't know what to do with are no it's saying one that it doesn't know what to do it because the the GUI does not map to a live project I guess yeah that's not good so I guess in that list of things to do one thing we could do is update the readme even though I guess you can't do that from the IDE you'd have to do that from we might as well do that from github okay cuz I was just gonna say chain the copyright needs updated from 2016 to today yeah and I guess Luke is the copyright holder does he want to be the copyright owner we'll have to ask him last time I asked it was yes oh okay cool that was year and a half ago um and then what was one of those other things so that that'll be done then to build a docker image okay so maybe we just keep working on removing that Etsy B since you could build yeah we could see where you're at with that okay I guess I'll commit this drag you into the master branch although I'm not sure I need to do that now yeah you could you could do that and just say like clothes closes number two is it closed number two yeah it's number two update to read me with the light right here that is what it says yep I wonder if that a lot of update on my screen no oh it did that's that that never ceases to make me happy to see that the fact that it closed the issue well well that it's that it updates it on a webpage yeah right right yeah just like remote actual action taking place and now no one can say that we didn't accomplish anything that's right so we have accomplished something we have they didn't read me file you know it's the little things sometimes you get it you gotta celebrate Lohri that's right what happened to the what happened to the issue that says update or remove at CD oh it's right there at number three yeah you were hovered over it is it's grayed out I thought it was like a closed item or something so let me show you what happened the last time I ran this okay so it fails six times and only on the last time this is just the way it was constructed only on the last failure does it actually print out the exception that it's getting right okay only HTTP HTTP schemes are allowed so I'm down here in the sed client send request and that gets called from killing video service discovery lookup service async where is that oh I thought I had that open oh yeah I do yeah yeah oh no that's that it's a new one that's a nice service discovery lookup service async okay so it calls it like this from the client get note async and the client is an instance of a TV client from a CD net that's a neat client so when I looked at that operation I started to try to debug this thing and oh here you go so it creates a net CD client and it basically like points it at with these SME options so the URLs litter it's supposed to go and it sets it up HTTP colon slash slash this and then when it actually goes to look stuff up it's gonna you know hit that from the client it's gonna look under this path slash go to video services like source name and then I'm looking at the output and it says only each GP and HTTP schemes are allowed so I'm like what that doesn't make any sense to me because it seems pretty clear that we are initializing that client with an HTTP protocol so I'm a little confused but then I was trying to get this thing running I just wanted to see if I could get it up and running working the old way yeah in order to start working from a you know good start point of something that was working and I'm starting to think that that's gonna be a wasted effort for me to try to debug what's going on with using sed which is the thing I'm trying to get rid of it anyway yeah I would almost so I was gonna give up on trying to get the old way running yeah I that's kind of what I would opt to do because even if you got it running then you got to figure out how to I mean you still have to figure out how to rip out at CD and you're gonna have to figure out how to how the app service actually references services anyway that's right and then stick so our new way in there and stick our new way in there great so I've been I've been dissecting this thing there is yeah so I noticed that there is this sed service discovery class that it was implemented yeah there we go okay so within the Killa video there's the service discovery xyg service discovery implements I find services I went to the declaration of that and then oh yeah there we go through the video dot host this is a common package for the videographers so I actually went to find every place that this I find services is used and there's quite a few places as you would expect like most of the places that need to call out to other things in the application use this right Oh bootstrap data stacks Enterprise uses this and stores insist service discovery and then it uses service discovery to look up Cassandra but then yeah um then there's like one of the services just to show you yeah a do this killer video search so here's what it does with its service discovery thing it looks up in DSC it looks up DSC - search so it is expecting that in NCD and I'll explain why this matters in a second the search service implementation is depending on Etsy D as its service discovery implementation to locate a service for it that is known by this name d su search and then it is running this in a loop where it's waiting for this to be up right and the way that we're doing the service discovery now there's nothing that has ever registered we're not we're not using service discovery like the the version of killer video that is not using NCD there is nothing that ever gets registered as a search service so in this particular service I actually basically just need to rip out this logic that is depending on DSC search being available as part of its start over - it just has to go away right so there are a couple of places that are using this I find services interface and so the behavior what s we dropped out may be slightly different in each one suggested videos is gonna be the same thing like this is going to suggested videos service oh that's so weird it is also waiting on DSC search whatever I do to the search service I need to do the same thing to the suggested videos service another another possibility do we just want to rip out what is in the I find services code implementation of the interface and make it be our pointer to our new way of mapping things do you think that might work it kind of seems like that's the focal point yeah well I could I guess so but think about what this is doing so I'm in suggested video service and [Music] look of DSC search is returning a Tasker on a URI and then it's going to return this lookup do some search get DAC sorry where is that get related videos response awake but okay so this is actually hmm so interestingly DSC search in you know current version is implemented using solar so now this is super interesting okay okay I'm just I'm learning more about this um trying to figure out how to explain this so previously the way that in in earlier versions of DSC search you had to hit this HTTP API to perform searches right so crazy db-api we have updated other language implementations of the killer videomicro services to perform solar queries using the extended cql syntax so like here's the equivalent Killa video python search service search service is selects are from videos where solar query equals it is a cql query it has a little bit of solar syntax in the solar query field but it is not hitting an HTTP endpoint hmm so this is my this is my dilemma here is that what what we are revealing is some of the age of some of this stuff like it's building up a solar request the reason I could just make it work the way that it works now but it going in here it makes me want to modernize more of this I'm just I'm identifying new areas of this application that are really kind of behind the times right as I begin to unravel this so at a minimum I'm gonna create another issue all right you wish you sorry these are the sorts of things that I've discovery as I'm looking through the code and maybe this isn't all bad that like I'm still in kind of more of a discovery phase than an actual coding fix yes that's really all bad anyway yeah I think that's that's a good thing because I mean it's been a year and there's actually a pretty substantial amount of code in his project totally and if we did start yanking stuff out we'd probably break everything we could so I mean that that is a a possible implementation what I think you are saying is basically or at least maybe this isn't what you're saying it's just what I was thinking before I discovered this new obsolete code is that I would just basically make a new implementation of the I find services interface right that handed back all of the new locations or new ways of locating things yeah yeah that's that's what I was thinking - okay cool while we're looking at this though I noticed there's little warning thingies I'm assuming they're warning things they look kind of like warning things on the bootstrap data stacks Enterprise CS file and the package horn big and I was just wondering what what like does it say anything else like if you right-click or like if you open up the file am i doing what you were asking yeah I'm just I'm I was I was silently watching the IDE to see if there was any Sun yeah yeah that's that little triangle is scroll scroll down a little bit I think there was some squiggly lines oh yeah there is oh the x.509 certificate so this is interesting too okay another observation is that this is has an optional ssl encryption option that's set up between the client and data sacks enterprise which I never even implemented that in the Python services I don't know which of the other implementations it has been provided in got you I don't this code is not going to even be exercised with my you know current configuration I am NOT providing a assert sirs I'm not providing a sir yeah yeah I was just I was mostly curious just cuz of why it's throwing the warning sign like is it referencing Krypton I don't know I don't know what it's referencing or why it's throwing a warning maybe it's just like a versioning thing like saying that you got an oh we got an old version of the cert code or something like that but I don't know it it doesn't seem like that big of a deal I was just curiosity mostly no quick fix where's that that sounds fun show redundant array creation expression what maybe this is just a syntax thing oh it it might be you wouldn't initializer I bet I know why now yes ah okay I'll tell you exactly what it was - so the new instantiation code that has right there in the old one it literally creates two arrays and then has two mem copy behind the sound all right between right yeah it's more efficient yep okay that's cool that's interesting we fix what we didn't lose we have it's good question maybe that was the only one why don't ya I don't know of a way to like where I would figure out what else is happening I would I would think they would show up if there were more where did what first trigger to that was that the fact just that little icon on the bootstrap bootstrap data stacks Enterprise dot cs5 well it still has a little yellow icon on it so maybe it still has more maybe it might it might not updated like it might need to do a full build or something like that let's watch did it do it or desert it yeah oh there goes it's trying to do that it's running waiting busty to start yeah I don't know refresh oh well cause a little thing on it I don't know what that is about yeah okay well so what's the what's the next question then the night the next question would be oh we we were both thinking about updating whatever core thing implements that contract for the I find services bit but then we had looked at MIT class yeah I guess we could we could go that route and then we just need to figure out what we need to add to it or which services need to add to it seems like even have nice if I could create a new implementation of it an existing interface oh yeah so probably what you would have to do at least in some of the previous the the other IDs you can do you just create the class like create the class file that's gonna be the new implementation okay and then when you do like public class blah blah : yes do that oh my see that yeah and then if you do : I find services it should what Oh what is I find certain what project is I find services referenced in I mean where's it actually located at is this is that what I have to do no you should just be to do just like public class Etsy service discovery right there you should be able to do that and then yeah okay so we're in the right project that has it so do that and then go click on the little thing yeah the light bulb and yeah you don't add the using for you do do the using first so that I had that and then click on it again and you can do like to generate stubs for all the contract stuff yeah what's the difference between explicitly so actually click on it and so just do the first one first implement interface yeah and okay so that's that's the implementation or the stub of the method that would implement the contract requirement you know who there's only one I don't know if it'll do it so delete that again the bit that just added and then just do the explicit one and it should come up with the its explicit syntax it's not giving me a thing click click on the I find services word and it should yeah there goes the pops back up and then do the explicit one and then does if there's no difference in this case yeah in this case there isn't it's I forget exactly what the key word is we just which is one of the reasons why I wanted you to create it and then just delete it and create it yeah but there's a like an explicit key word or something like that that is added to the method somewhere in the signature that basically says like I am specifically contractually meeting this part of the interface agreement with this method and you're like explicitly saying it versus just assuming that the method name refers to the method name the contract so that's all interesting okay okay cuz it I mean I guess you can do this in Java too but like one of the things that gets pretty gnarly in c-sharp and I say gnarly but like a lot of people use it because it's pretty helpful but you have in in the method signatures there is a pretty nutty range of ways to use the the method signature the assumption is that you pass in however many parameters and you either have a void method or you return one thing but there is a billion ways to pass in an unidentified number of items as parameters that aren't particularly strongly typed initially and there was a way to return a bunch of values to so you can kind of write C sharp similarly to say JavaScript or go at this point and thus the signatures get super confusing it's a name service discovery all right so you got you've got your contract and necessary method we're gonna do anything with this right the constructor is not necessary did it put that there for you yeah you know I'm generated it yeah in case I wanted to do something with it I suppose right oh okay so the the next thing is to figure out how we want to how do we want to implement our service lookup well I was thinking that if we could do a couple things I do like since since someone Luke went to the trouble of creating this nice API that abstracts things it's nice that we can continue to use it because then ideally and we go to let's say that some point down the road we actually decided that I don't know like we're gonna use a service mesh or something like that yep like then we provide a new implementation of this API and then in theory the application works isn't right so yeah I was thinking that we may just put in like the dumbest thing is just put in some hard-coded values basically yeah that's kind of what I mean that's what we were doing just missing the critic map we really needed is just what we really need is just a map of nate service names that are expected to strings that are it's a map of string to string yep that this gives you back the right string so and then it needs to be based on it's not totally dumb because there are there's some cases where there's a default value that could be overridden by an environment variable mm-hmm and again the simplest way for me to show this is the Python code so go to main function so the contact point for the DSC cluster I'm gonna get the contact points environment variable that is not set I'm gonna say the contact points is DSC basically I just need to do the equivalent of that so basically get an environment variable environment variables not available use use DSC you're right but then we already have this mechanism that's in here so not to confuse things oh yeah where was the main function of this thing it's Travis yeah this host configuration Factory yes this is they were looking at last time and it was load some information from from a dock env file and it was gonna try to set these two these two names right name and then it's gonna go through and override a bunch of other configuration variables and it's basically again it's basically just populating a map configuration name to configuration value so our implementation basically needs to leverage some of these configuration values as it as it is providing results based on the names that are being requested so some of this is gonna be a little bit hacky but I want I want to try to honor the configuration values where they are provided yes so this thing runs at applications startup yeah well I and I guess the thing we're trying to do also runs at application startup this is for system related well this is yeah this is for system related values and the the bit we're working on is for systemic values related to the services that the quarter service needs to communicate with right okay yes and this uses the figuration Factory yes it's not it's not that this is this is not really super hard right it's really just about thank you through with the like a clean and proper way to do it mm-hmm well actually end up writing probably about like ten lines of code right well the the other thing I was thinking is if so we're kind of sort of wanting to do the same thing actually so it's kind of like this thing which our empty class at CES I have a question here when I rename this to name service discovery it doesn't rename the file right yeah if you name it the same and then I mean I thought this IDE had refactoring but it doesn't look like it has refactoring like in JetBrains writer when you rename the file to say do you want to rename the class and vice versa like if you rename the class it'll say do you want to rename the file yeah like a map or something it needs some kind of map thing probably probably use it dictionary I think oh right oh it might be i dick ssin arey no oh what those that word and then you do open clothes arrows or whatever those things are called i guess 'sir arrows left right arrows yeah and in that put the yeah the key value pair what was what was that it it like prompted you to do it like it was trying to yeah just pick pick key value pair see what it does oh that's that's weird I don't know what that did that for but oh there's there's the that's the definition I'm just gonna say like in in the arrows you just put like what what type you want in the dictionary so it can be like int and string or string and string I just go with string and string yeah oh and then that's just suggesting like a really holistic name of that variable is that it yeah that make yeah that barely makes sense now yeah okay you get it constructor back I put it back because I need to create this thing oh yeah yeah yeah I'm gonna populate it with some stuff and then the implementation of this is literally just gonna be like a lookup yeah so they could correct what I'm thinking is the constructor so you just put all the values in the key bear give it my am I gonna have to give it my configuration my config there's my config keys and then my host configuration factory what I don't know if you if we do we do we need to do another host configuration factory creation of configuration to do this or do we just want to return a dictionary per the I've find services because you know the ice find services contract I would think we'd want to do that right hmm what are you saying the so here there's the factory right that creates the configuration and returns configuration of the configuration then has a list of Oh light right below it it says new environment file source and it builds up a dictionary list of string strings you know and in that case it's the Etsy de IP killer video docker IP which is like a map to the map of the configuration value itself and I was thinking in our stuff for what we call it file just now Nate named service discovery yeah why don't we just return the dictionary of it because oh well it's saying the contract for I find services returns a task which I guess is the specific service connection confused what's a task its operation you can return a value oh okay you and then you await the task mm-hmm and then when it's when the string is available then the task will return right so it's a way of yeah like asynchronously getting looking up these strings now the thing is in our case there's no point it'll ah it'll just all of you immediately available right so in that case oh and it turns an ienumerable string list so mystic strings a numerable list of strings that's seems weird but whatever okay here's what I was thinking the basic strategy for this is in the constructor of this thing I'm just gonna build out this dictionary right yeah that's that's what I'll say cuz it's just gonna have that just return the lookup of the value right there at the result yeah yeah that makes sense to me I'm not particularly familiar with that Nets modern tasks thing like I don't know how you feed back the particular item once you get it but I get what we're I get what we're trying to do and I get that it returns some string so I guess we just returned one string with the task yeah yeah so like ienumerable it's this is the possibility that you could actually have multiple entries in your discovery service for a given service name yeah and again we're just gonna have one right so okay do we have a unit test for this project where would they be I heard Oh traditionally in projects that are called whatever the project name is dot test dot test yeah but I'm just not seeing that yeah I don't see any either that might be a thing to add to but that's for later considerations yeah not really yep yeah it looks like a bold a bold no all right so I guess it's just feed the do we have a list of the things for the dictionary already yeah I'm going to need to [Music] this is go I need to go through and find all the places where it says lookup service async and then did it yeah so there's one Cassandra there's another one I don't know what the service name is is this channel factory thing I don't even know I don't even dug in to what this is yet yeah I don't I don't have any idea either DSE search is another that'll have to be replaced eventually with a more modern thing that's the actual implementation that's our new implementation web wait a minute oh yeah we don't need this this is lame look at the web you guys address yeah and this business is like giving you a friendly message about how you can open the user interface oh yeah this I don't think that's necessary at all really yeah I mean this is the back-end services so like it we shouldn't even it shouldn't know where the front end in is anyway it's a separation of concerns they're fix that one done fix the sock what is that it's it's fussing in any way I could it's right wait what did it say said the logger exists already and it doesn't exist oh yeah it's not declared how is that possible yeah it's not it's not possible oh oh it was above where it's actually declared you know why it's because I deleted the line of code that created it oh that would now it's now it's not complaining anymore look at that what do you know that explains all the questions looks like host dot service discovery it's not needed anymore what you talking about exactly new new array looks like it could be fixed too boom hey that that looks cleaner there's like less words and stuff that's how I know that I'm doing good coding if there's fewer lines of code yeah finished and at the start I've done a good job so I measure productivity net reduction I like that one all right all right I feel pretty good about this do you should I commit what I have I think you should commit what you have because I would I would definitely work off of that where it is incrementally better and I have not actually swapped in the new implementation of service discovery yet right so is it I mean this is legal code yeah I'll just have comments rights all right yeah and in.net land all that stuff as long as it's not called it's not gonna ever throw that exception so right okay win put the change to the CS proj I feel good about this no no wait a minute the the fourth file there your time up wait a minute you have a cheap just there you also have a good give ad what did I do that oh that's the one register that's not a ready thing yeah my lager it's fine okay so that's worth having but then what's the what did I do to the these are their files I think ACS progr the or the attempt to update and the refresh of the one thing yeah so I guess that's okay yep and then the packages thing I suspect is the same thing related to an update yep yeah this is sort of an incoherent commit but those those pieces work though I mean for the DSC google protobuf and non-generic collections that that stuff should be updated anyway so that's cool even though the non-generic connections are look like they're going backwards version 4.0 dot 1 vs. 4 dot 3.0 oh no wait that was an addition the line above it is a different thing okay that totally works ok first commit on the remove that CD branch oh cool I made some progress um Tuesday I'm gonna be an Apache con oh yeah should we I don't know what I'm gonna be doing it 1 p.m. on Tuesday at Apache can Vegas what am I gonna be doing I don't know I just that 1 p.m. on Tuesday so looking at myself celebrate with my fingers of yay is totally disorientating because it's going the opposite way I'm moving my fingers because of the mirror effect and it just completely no no ok so what we need to figure out what we're gonna do for this stream because it looks like I have a lunch appointment alright um maybe you and David want to fire something up I don't know we could do that I could I could do a mono stream too or a solo stream however you want to call it ok for one or two in probably troubleshoot some of the update stuff you know the office like trying to update the project file itself so that we can do updates to the dependencies because that looks like what might be part of the problem that's pretty G gnarly looking so any others that would be that would be awesome I would hardly approve of that I will I will plan and put that on the event for next week the event they've been calendar and also sync up with ceedric too cuz he was saying that he got most of his stuff to build with that net course I'm curious wearing what he was on and if there might be a branch that we don't know about intriguing yeah cool awesome so I guess catch everybody next time
