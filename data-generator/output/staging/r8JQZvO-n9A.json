    "text": "my name is q gabriel i work for data stacks and i'm gonna take you through a demonstration i put together to kind of show the power and differences of the various apis through which you can access your data in data stacks astra so um here's our repository first we're going to go through the setup here pretty quickly there's not a lot of code actually a lot of these are like you know readmes and configs this page kind of talks you through each of the different files and what they're for and we'll come back to that here's some directions for setting up astra so first let's go get our data sex astra database set up i'm just going to use our free tier i've already logged in here i'm just going to name my database stuff and the key space can also have the same name as the database in this case i will i'm gonna come up with a very creative username and password i'll let you guess what that is you'll see it later i do have to choose my region here i'm going to do us east and launch that database so i'm going to go view this i'm not going to save that password and we're going to let this come up and this is going to take i don't know a little bit but we'll pause while that's happening okay so my database has launched only took a couple of minutes and we're going to grab a couple of useful pieces of data that we're going to need later one we're going to download this secure connect bundle and that went to my downloads and i'm also going to click this little clipboard icon here to just copy that url we're going to be using that later as well really the only part that we're interested in is here at the beginning but it's kind of you know we truncated because it's kind of long so let's get back to the repository um so we need to check this out we're going to do that here just grab that little clipboard icon i'm gonna jump here get clone that little repository uh oh just it's very small not a lot of files and now we need to configure our application the first thing we have to do is that that file we just downloaded i want to drop that in here so here's my all astra apis uh window i downloaded that uh secure connect bundle right here i'm just gonna drag it right into there and um we can look now and see secure connect stuff is the name of that file we're going to need that in just a minute we're going to go edit the config and here uh we need to provide the path the full path to the secure connect bundle which i don't have handy oh let me just go grab that pwd uh that's why i need all this and secure dash connect dash stuff dot zip i'll go back into here and put that secure there these two lines are just for convenience so we don't have to put the whole astra url in here really all that you need is the cluster id and region which i said like i said earlier those were kind of in that url that i copied to my clipboard i'm going to grab that off my handy dandy little clipboard utility which is right here and i don't need this part at the end api rest because uh we're we're gonna append that to this base url base url here later later so i just need that first part and let me see if i've got all the configuration there this is the password that i use stuff password really creative i know don't use that in production stuff user and then the key space stuff now we're going to be defining a couple just three tables and those tables have already been defined here for the model mapper which is one of the four apis that i'm going to be taking you through and so the next thing we need to do is actually to create that schema so that schema is right here um we don't want to copy paste the line numbers so i'm just going to turn that off you don't need this top line unless if you're working with astra which you know you probably are because that's what this demo is for but in the event that you decided to create this using data stacks desktop or or your local installation of the cql and mapper apis will work just the same as they do with astra so i left that in there if you want to just be able to copy paste it so we're going to go back over to astra we're going to go to the cql console we're going to log in stuff user get logged in um now i can just paste my uh schema into this use stuff disk tables you can see that my tables did get defined users you can see the the full schema all this other stuff these are all default values that are for us to tune that table a lot of these we can't actually change in astra because we've already gone to the work of trying to choose the best values for you so really we're just paying attention to this part up here so now we've defined that schema we've configured the application uh now we're just going to run the tests and see well actually one one thing first i have to do npm install to load all the additional libraries done npm test and cross our fingers boom all of the table mapper functions the tql so mostly passing tests we had one failing here the tests run very quickly and sometimes it doesn't opt in to authenticate correctly if i rerun this test again that'll probably pass or something else might fail but by and large that's it so now we know that our all of our apis are working we're able to authenticate and use rest graphql our cql mapper and our cql uh you know native language apis so let's take a quick look at the test file which is named after the file that it tested table multi api in this file what we have is sections of each api so for example all the gql stuff is all together and it's create read update delete and then all the rest api functions are together create read update delete and it's against two tables each i don't have 100 test coverage here all the cql functions create read update delete same story and then last the cql mapper functions create read update delete so if you dig into these it's in each of these tests it's this middle line here so all this other stuff is about defining the test but in each of these you'll see something looks like users dot cqlm create cql mapper in this case see curio and create here and then read read update update delete and delete try that line i'll go backwards through the file here's the cql create read update delete and the rest create read update delete so you can see all those sections so the sample data is up here at the top if you want to look at that that's in the sample data file so now let's go take a look at the actual table multi api table multi api is the table where we've defined that class that we just ran through the test uh that test file so we're calling new this thing here's a constructor nothing magical there here what we've done is we've got the the each function to show off the create functions so here's rest this is what it looks like to use the rest api there is a convenience function defined in another file i'll show you in a minute that goes through and allows this post to work it does all the authentication kind of takes some of the boilerplate out of your way so you can just focus on what's really unique to each of these uh http apis so that's the rest in the graphql and this does look a little bit weird i know this syntax post and then that returns a function which is then invoked here we've got the gql create and then i've added a lot of additional comments to sort of show you what code is being created underneath one thing i will point out is in the future we may have additional uh versions of the rest or graphql api so pay pretty close attention to the v1 here that's this is our first version and so in the future if that changes you may be looking at v2 and these samples may not work quite the same coming down here to the the cql create you can see we're just using this insert into syntax and we've got table name fields values if you've ever worked with sql before or done string interpolation with sql you probably have worked with similar syntax to this and so what you can see here is here's the query that i just defined the temp the template for here and then i had placeholders which i'm uh injecting in as a second argument and then this is prepared uh prepared true means it's a prepared statement i learned kind of the hard way that if you don't use prepared statements sometimes it's difficult for the node.js driver to to know what types are being inserted in and so it can throw some errors but so as long as you do prepare true the driver will have all the necessary knowledge about the schema to properly build those queries and last but not least is the cql mapper and this is actually my favorite and it should be obvious why it's super simple this dot model map insert and then i just took that java or json object or well it's not json's javascript object and it it mapped all those in for me so if you look through the rest of this file you'll see very similar a similar pattern here's the read functions we start with rest again gql or graphql is in the second section cql and then last is the cql mapper again same thing with the update you can see the further down you the file you go i provided fewer and fewer comments because it's a lot of the same things over and over and then we export so as much as i really like the mapper api i really wanted something just a little bit different and here's why if you look in the config js file with the mapper you have to define your mappings between model names and table names you can have multiple tables listed and there's several other configuration options which are documented right there but for my purposes i really just wanted to have a one-to-one mapping between the model name and the table name i want them to be exactly the same so i created and i didn't want to have to define that configuration thing which i guess is what programmers are good at what was that uh i wrote two whole files to eliminate six lines of configuration yeah that's i know it's silly but what did i do in this file there's a key space mapper and what this does is it goes out and it introspects the system schema here and it will build that configuration for me with the one-to-one mapping just like i wanted it also calls out to this table mapper because it has to call that for each one of the tables in the key space and then that allows me to have that if i use this key space mapper use the table name like users.insert without having to define that that little configuration option which now that i'm explaining it to you it sounds pretty silly that i wrote all of this to avoid six lines of configuration but you don't have to write those six lines of configuration if you don't want to because i wrote two whole files to save you from that yeah that's funny anyway you may be also interested in knowing about some of the utility functions here i'm just going to very quickly run through some of these some of the most important ones chunks of boilerplate code that i have just kind of taken away from you is the authenticate function and then earlier you heard me reference the post function which is all here there are some standard http headers that you have to provide with each request this x cassandra request id and x chris sander token that's part of the authentication i'm already doing all of that here just sort of taking away just against totally boilerplate handling some http errors through here you know not really doing a whole lot with them other than just sort of saying hey that's that's what happened and some other things are kind of important down here this function right here props to columns the rest api wants i i like providing uh javascript object or json looking syntax which is what this is that's what you're usually going to be working with in your programs is something that looks like this however the rest api wants you to provide json looks like this this is actually not uncommon you'll find this in actually a lot of restful apis that they like to use this sort of name value syntax an array of those and so this is just performing that mapping for you pass in the property object and it spits out this also the graphql api really prefers camelcase it's kind of peculiar about that and i i don't know i worked in ruby for too long and so i tend to prefer this camel case syntax with underscores and i'm not sorry not the cambod's case the snake case is what it's called and so i had to have a little function to do all those nice conversions for me and last but not least the graphql is kind of peculiar about the json syntax at once and so i wrote a convenience function here to make all the little minor conversions you have to make so that's a quick tour of all astra apis and i hope that you find this file useful in getting you up and running more quickly in your work with data stacks astra thanks",
