our Workshop my name is Melissa I'm a Solutions engineer here at datax um little bit about me and stuff that I do I come from a computer science background um but started going into the solutions engineering side so I talked to a lot of users like you developers like you um who are in the Gen space and I'm able to uh show them a lot of our sample apps with our products especially astb um and yeah fashion buddy was something my team and I made so I'm really excited to Showcase that with you all um and we're using a lot of architecture that um data stxs provides such as uh rag stack llms that you might see there um on the slide as well um as well as mentioning other gen tools like linkchain and might even throw in a little bit of Lan flow in there too um so here's my contacts and that's me Cedric back to you yeah right so thank you um oh by the way you have our coordinates on the top left hand corner so you know feel free to reach out to us this is why we put those uh content the session is recorded so you know in sometime we are moving too fast in the endzone do not worry we will give you everything all the code all the source uh all the way to test uh the things so I'm s Len I'm software engineer datastax uh I've been a couple of done a couple of Workshop already last last year but you know 2024 I guess it's one of the first so I'm super happy to be back in front of you doing some real technical session so I'm an opp Source developer doing a lot of java but today it's python so let's go with python python is cool as well I've been some Cassandra and I'm also working multiple AI project obviously um so what do we do today so today is uh practical okay so it's a live you can ask your question uh live so we are live on chomecast on YouTube on LinkedIn um but we cannot have eyes everywhere so we will monitor mostly the chat and also the Q&A in um in codcast where you see those IC to chat with us ask question and if we do any poll during the session you we will provide you uh the GitHub link it's already on screen by the way the GitHub link the code the slides everything is you know give away today if you stay with us up to the end uh we are playing a quiz you know really five minutes where you play with your phone anding for question if you answer fast uh you win yeah my t-shirts uh not exactly mine I'm not Ronaldo or anything like that but at least the same as me and it's pretty cool so they want some one on your back subject stay yes stay up to the end okay um it's pretty practical so this is what we will build we will interact with one AI provider which is Google and their solution vertex AI we will interact with a model called gimini and we will use use the API from Google okay us our application we will go uh with multiple steps so first we will just show you the vertex tool with the user interface how to use it but then we will install uh a python and we first show you how to use vertex AI with Google collab then we import the data set we use a database to uh interact and add some context on what LM cannot do and after that we move fully into python build a python application called streamlit and deploy in uh the website speaking of deployment maybe uh Melissa right away you can already show uh what the application look like right yeah yeah of course let me share my screen yeah let me stop sharing okay you will have those little transition where we switch like that so let's see yeah I see in the chat hi everyone all the the the URL of YouTube yeah the YouTube channel is data stxs devs um so we probably have a single live right now yeah thank you c d we're so super excited to to be here okay so now you know it's live yes we are live we are monitoring live and if any questions um please feel to drop those in the chat as Cedric was mentioning but this is our uh app that we are building today so fashion buddy as Cedric was mentioning um it's all in Python and this is being deployed on streamlet um so what does it do right what are we trying to do um if I'm a shopper do do I will download an image and I will upload this image I'm trying to find some similar items to the image that I am uploading here um so by doing that I can select some filter on the left side and then now recommend me some products that are similar to the items that I'm uploading and once I click the recommend products I should expect cool some options that are um similar to even the whole outfit itself so this is some shoes a bag even the Striped Sweater so cool how how do we do this how are we able to um analyze or interpret the photo and then how do we recommend these products as well that are similar to the photo we will go into that today and dive deeper as we go in through the code but just for your reference this is what we are building today all right nice okay so now I'm sharing it in let's go here we go we're getting good at that can you see my screen Misa yep yep you're good all right okay so um we will alternate a little bit of theory and go to endone okay um I try not to go over 10 minute of theory okay still the session is for beginners so even if you have U little experience with python uh we can just code uh just read through the code it's it's okay right uh we will not ask you to actually code you will use existing code so reminder G AI you may have heard about it with you know um obviously with chpt or gimini and and all the all other llm providers but it's not new right so if you want to position generative AI in the middle of data science or artificial intelligence this is how uh we uh we position that actually to slide from from Google I stole that slide from from a Google guy so artificial intelligence is the The Wider Spectrum where you get the machine learning with supervised algorith unsupervised algorithm the Deep learning which you have this neural network recursive and the Gen AI it's again just a little piece of these leveraging those neural network to produce some content so different type of context text or image here it's put imag because the model it's called imag 2 for Google but for um um for open AI you may have heard Del or if you're using any open source model you should check stable diffusion which is a start to generate generate image so this is the landscape of the llm and the model in March 2024 as you can see the number of parameters is keep growing keeps growing so the the amount of data to train is also growing but here you see the amount of parameters so why those parameter are important so here the more parameter you add the more use case you can do so it start by a Transformer language understanding summarization and then translation let's say all that was there already five years ago but when you add billions of billions of parameter now it start to reasoning do code completion do logical inference and stuff like that so nice animation but this is because the number of parameters I keep growing but um also we can do more and more use cases so gini is um newish model of Google I think it's probably two years old now um which is their uh new king model uh to so buil by Google de um de mind and the thing is which is nice with gimini it's a multimodal language model so what does that mean that mean that you can talk to gimini by asking question with both an image and the text so if you just interact with the chat just with text yeah you can have a discussion one by you know and the llm is aware of everything happened before but if you also introduce image in the chat jimini is still able to pick what's going on and do response according both the text and the image so let's say you you are a marketer and you want to generate multiple images with the same tone the same style it's not easy to do because you ask for an image you get something then you change a little bit your question hoping that you will just have a little tweak well most of the time you get a totally different image but if you say oh use the previous image as a standard this is what I like what I don't like with the previous image generate the new one now you have a chat with post image and text so pretty cool and this is actually what we will show you so was good to to show um Google B is no more anymore now has been replied by your gini web user interface as well everything is called G know I Google pretty easy okay so with all these parameters what are the use case what can you do with that so the language okay not surprising with small number of parameters you could already do a summarization classification the old um neural network uh thing but now you add code generation completion speech to te text to speech I mean most of you probably have seen the demo the multiple demo both from open AI from Google from Microsoft during the last weeks in the latest from open AI especially where they introduce the model GP and actually now you don't even have to touch your keyboard anymore it's all text to speech spe to text and the model will reply with a lovely voice and do uh all your stuff for you and vision so vision is what actually capturing um the image information so when you're interacting with both chat and image this is actually the vision that will G you the meaning of your image okay I told you not too much Theory but I need to position the the building block today in uh fashion bu we are using language and vision okay and without further Ado the lab one as I stated will be a using just just your brother interact with uh Google and also prepare for what's coming create a database using the web interface because this little guy will take a few minute to to to start so you do that with Melissa and after that you come back to me and we keep going with um the theory yeah I don't have the G Melisa today what I'm doing all Theory and you have all the fun all the handson stuff I know well actually we have one question in the chat if um from shy so Gemini is like anthropic plus stable diffusion in some sense kind yeah kind of so um a Tropic is actually the company who has a model which is called Cloe so and Cloe has a number of parameters and as far as as I know clo is uh can only interact with text so yeah Jim is try has a bit more and can do both text and image um yes so and shy we'll we'll see that here in just a few moments with with this lab one so um I promised you all this is going to be handson and we're going to get into that so actually let's share my screen yep thank you Cedric so I'm going to share some links if you're on the crowdcast they are right below us here um if not they should be also attached um I think to the description of this Workshop so if you're on the crowdcast below us you should see the sign up for Astra so let's all do that if you haven't done it already please take some few moments to do so let me share my screen and we can walk through this together so if you click this below I know sorry for the um Infinity uh screen share but there is some link here there is some link Here sign up for Astra click that it'll bring you directly to our sign up page so you can see here you'll sign up with GitHub with Google or with your email um so please take a few moments to do so me I already have a Astra account so I will log in with my Astra account I will sign up with Google some data stocks and I'm hoping we have some familiar faces with our Astro platform going to give a couple a few seconds to folks who have not created their account yet so that we are all on the same page here okay so are we good to move on Cedric you think uh yeah let's let's uh wait for the that and see if people um um okay are doing that with us and do not rush okay so yeah Pros is connected y so now you can get keep going okay thank you folks all right so um Astra this is our product right we are a database that is implemented now Vector search and Vector features that are very integral into generative AI application development um so you here in our dashboard at this time um first things first let's get you familiar with some key things here um anina said she tried Astra cool thank you um I what we will need for this Workshop later on when we go a bit more Hands-On is a database so how do we do that we can go ahead and click create a database and let's all give it the same name let's do fashion buddy Workshop for provider you can select your uh preferred provider and then for region these things don't really matter for the for the purpose of the demo so you can select any defaulted region and then select create database and that takes a couple minutes to spin up so we will visit back here in just a moment so next thing here is to get signed up on vertex AI so again if you are in the crowdcast I put the link here down um for vertex AI so if you have not signed up for vertex AI it should look like this on that link sorry not like this like this you sign in with your normal Google account so if you already have a Google account account great and then you just select try it in console and then you should be directed to the vertex AI platform so I'm going to slow down again here I just want to make sure that everybody is now in vertex AI if you are please say yes in the chat where did you find vertex AI it is um I linked it here um right under our web video feed there should be a Vertex AI link so you can select that and then it'll bring you to the signin page yes you go to the Google console you got this uh big console you can enter vertex AI in the search bar it will show you and because it's there um you know shiny product they are linked directly to enable everything you need to use it um and going into there what they go the studio yep yep yep oh yeah thank you thas sheling oh thank you thank you Michelle for sharing the handy links too okay amazing amazing so I'm going to move on from here um so this is vertex AI again right we will be doing um so if you have not yet had a project created we must first create a project so I already have one here if not you can go into this uh toolbar up top and then create new project give it a name it will default it to you um itself and then once you're here um I want to grab several credentials that we will be using in our development Hands-On Workshop a little bit a little bit later so if we are all here at the select the project screen you'll see the ID go ahead and save that ID copy paste it put it in some notes for later good have a few seconds here and we'll um wait to move on did everyone get their ID if yes you could put a yes in the chat as well yeah and you know we we move fast in the beginning so we can you know post for to be sure everybody has the time to manipulate so there are so many service in in um Google cloud and even in the AI Parts you see there are so many piece so in the vertex AI environment uh you can find here some ready to go um notebook to train you uh if you look on the menu there is the model Garden so maybe Melissa you can click on the model Garden to see uh what it look like it's the second link on the yes on the on the top yeah so here you see G is the multi-purpose model so slower but more deep because more parameter imagine is like the single purpose imag generation so um you know do doing that Gemma is an open source model that you can actually download and run locally uh ship is probably their coding so um a lot of model have not so many parameter but um um are used for single purpose so completion code generation text Tech to speech tech to matage um text to video now but this one is not been released by open a Rosa model um yeah the trick yeah and you saw that those those guy are releasing uh The gimini Flash super fast but not so many parameters and jimin pro um with 1 million token compex window so so no they are not mtim model so uh the what we call the token window is how many element you can put in your question and in your answer yes so chimo yeah that's that's that's that's verx say I will uh try you for a free trial and we'll give you we'll give you some some I think he gave you you like 300 uh bucks to to you should get some credit so yeah you still need to uh provide a billing account that you will not use but that's how they opt in yeah yeah good good call out Cedric so um it will ask you to provide the billing account um if you go up to the three dots on the top right uh there's billing account management that's where you can um add that there and then um for the purpose of the sample app it won't be a lot of consumption you won't be utilizing a lot of credits so um as we follow along just wanted to call that out yeah every s here man how can I go to model Garden if you go if you are in your vertex AI homepage it should be um on the left side under Tools link yes it's also there you have the uh so yeah if you click model Garden you see the model garden and here um yeah see there is all these model you you can pick whatever you want so vertex AI is like a huge proxy with an API and you as a developer you are using the vertex AI API and H they you can deploy their the default model but you can also ask Google to actually deploy a model like Lama 3 and you can interact through ver text and just to avoid to to confuse also if you go back on the menu on the side there is vertex AI studio and you can actually play a little bit if you want yeah yeah let's play around with the really see what Gemini can do um if we're still following along you can you can do this too or you can um just observe so on the left side we have the vertex AI studio um you can actually try Gemini so we could just talk directly to the llm you go so here you have the prompt the question you asked and on the uh on the right side you see all the settings all the the the the little parameter that you can use to tune your requests so the name of the model is the most obvious one and then you do have a couple of others below so uh one is the temperature so it's between zero and one there is no one better than the other if you go to zero it will not be creative at all it will be almost predictive you know exactly what it will do you ask twice the same question you get the the same answer but the more you get to one the more creative it's become so you can say maybe it's subject to hallucinate it's possible but depending on what you do you want to do you want the the model to generate something a bit um maybe fancy if you a marketer or a sales uh maybe you want to try multiple things and have have the choice yeah so go for it yeah yeah so let's see it in action right like if I if I'm using one of our data Stacks marketing images here so um I want to ask maybe what is this photo of course we have a rhino with some wings but let's see what Gemini tells us when we submit this request uh so if you're running into this issue the billing disabled this means that you have to add the billing account so again it's just asking to add that yeah it's asking you must add this but um you won't be charged on that you have some free credits but it's just some Google thing to add the billing account so if you are following along and that's what you are receiving then that is how to so just somebody ask can you just show again where you find this vertex Studio yeah yeah so if you are in our dashboard you have some toolbox on the left vertex AI Studio should be the third header here and then um if you just go into overview actually you can go maybe you can just uh yeah um yeah yeah maybe language would work yeah never mind yes the recording will be available in varo so as soon as the Twitter uh the the YouTube live is is gone um uh it's it's it's there for you to pause and redo uh this is also why sometime we we are moving and I think now now everybody at the time to look at the UI and uh we should um that the Astra database is probably now started so we should uh I we should go back a little bit in theory uh before moving into code sounds good um and and one thing sorry before we go back um we all saw the uh vertex AI playground if you started up your Astro database and you have that running you can now um grab the database details so I asked you to grab your project ID from the Google uh project console and now let's set aside on your database your API endpoint so go ahead copy that and then we need to generate a token as well so generate token here and you can copy and paste this and those three credentials we will need for our notebook later okay good I will answer any questions in the chat but I'll hand it back over to Cedric to continue with the theory okay so now let me share my screen um back to me okay so um the purpose of these five 10 to 10 minute Endzone was really for you to get your vertex AI project ID and in Astra your database URL and uh the database credentials this is mainly what we will need okay so uh when you interact with your llm you are doing a prompt so what is a good prompt just asking the question to the llm is not enough uh I mean you can iterate and you iterate a lot before uh finding something uh super easy to do so there is methodology called prompt engineering to help you ask the question to the llm and it's not broken science it's just hading the proper uh area in your prompt and use that as a checking list so you need a context you you need to tell who is you are a professional marketer and your mission is to help here and that that's the objective you also need to um to to to tell um who um so that's that's that's your mission that's your directive this is how you should answer the question and uh you should also provide the constraint this is how you want you to answer as an as a as a table as as an image which which sty it's also very important to tell the llm what is not accepted what is forbidden so um if you start implementing a AI app uh and a chatbot that will answer question with those technology he will try to transer everything even if you put the temperature to zero and try not to be creative it will still uh try to run as best as it can even if it cannot so there is a good practice which is always put in the prompt if you don't know say you don't know it seems obvious but um that's that's what you need to do and uh yeah be careful just Side Story um some company have been you know accountable of what the chatbot is saying so you know be careful um so but just you and the llm maybe it's not enough so it's not enough because llm has a a a fact a fact date so it will be it will be it's train once and after that it needs to be retrained or you will have a new version of the model but let's say uh gimini 1.5 has been trade that's it everything that happened from now from the the training date and now he does not know uh he also does not know about your data if you run a company and you want the chat Bo to answer question regarding your product your documentation what you are doing just going with the llm is is not enough so you need something else and this something else is something you add in your prompt something you add at the end of The Prompt or you add information about you about your document about uh your website I saw before question in the chat asking ah how do you uh put a PDF in that and this is actually what we will explain you today so the pattern is called retrievable augmented generation so you will take your data put in in a new type of database and this new type of database will be used in the um in your query so in a database the database type is called the vector database okay so in a vector database you saved oh what surprise vectors because in a database you the data is saved in a way to optimize all the queries all the reads so here um we want to search and compute some uh meaning similarity semantic similarity in between sentences why do we want to do that you ask a question to the model and we will ask the model find me all the information that is super close to the question and is part of your documentation well to do that we are trying to find meaning that is close to the question you ask so we do a similarity search and this computation is done with Vector We compare Vector to Vector so a vector database we expect the vector database to save your vector and also to be able to do this semantic comparison so um at data Stacks we have been behind the open source project Apachi this also what I got in my t-shirt so it's a no sequal database colon oriented that be there for a while that can do availability linear scalability leny and global distribution for very technical um for very um easy to explain reason uh it's not f is you know High availity because on that database you have multiple node and the same data is on multiple node so you can lose a node it's not a big deal it's scale linearly so what actually we did we enabled Vector in Cassandra and what you just created before on Astra DB is actually a database as a service that give you this candra with the vector enabled and on top of it an API to interact with because nowadays we don't want to interact with drivers lowlevel drivers um and we expose API really look like each API where you do find one find many um find Vector okay so how do we do R A so you provide a document the document needs to be splitted into shank and the Shunk will be transformed in a vector a vector is called an embedding and why do we shank well we shank because a vector can only encode you know not so many meaning also maybe you don't want to have multiple meaning in in the same Vector you want you know single purpose meaning so when you do the shuning that's um the the framework will already try to uh Shunk not in the middle of nowhere but chunk at the end of a group of words or at the end of the sentences try to isolate what has what has meaning and also it's not a hard cut it will try to make the Shunk uh override one or each other because then you can retrieve later consecutive Shunk if you need to so your your data is split transform to Vector the vector has save in a vector space when you say your vector you can actually add metadata and that's also what you expect now with those Vector database you want to search with Vector but you all you maybe also want to add some some some some criteria like the name of the file or the people who actually have access to the data or all the kind um so here in fashion bu we want the metadata to be the type of close so now you can see say find me all the claes that are super close close that are super um similar to the image or the text I provided you but that also needs to be this piece of um like a jacket or a shirt and that is a metadata so when you search you search both on vector and on metadata so this is how you insert the data now when you retrieve the data you ask the question the question is also transform of the vector you perform this similarity to find all the shuns that are close to your question and this is exactly those sh that will be happened at the end of your prompt and voila so now when you ask a question to the model you put the constraint the limits but at the end you add something like and to help you with your answer consider this piece of documentation and here you got all the shunks coming from documentation okay so I think I did a 10 minutes it's already back time to go back to uh code and stuff so now we keep vertex AI we keep Astra but we uh are showing you some python code in a Google collab web base nothing to install just click on the link and we will go into the different steps you need to do that a ag Pipeline and now I think it's back to you already Min back to me yes so lab two here again we are going to I'm going to share this Google collab with you um we're going to see how to import the data see how the vector embeddings are being created and then we're going to actually do um we're going to call Gemini um as our model and uh the M to generate the response for us and then perform the vector search of course with astb so if you are following along in the crowdcast I will share the Google collab below um this link is where we'll be doing a majority of our work here so click along and I will share my screen sorry okay oh so folks who are following oh oop I shared the wrong screen this is and you you show all the the dirty details now my secrets are out just kidding okay um all right folks this is a Hands-On so we'll be going through uh these things pretty uh step by step so just to review where are we so far we are we want to build fashion buddy the demo that we showed in the beginning um how do we do this so we have to bring in some data vectorize those data turn them into embeddings save them into astb which is a vector database and then from the user side to retrieve this data if we are going to submit a query we have to vectorize that query do a vector search to Astra and then generate the response now that all means a lot of craziness so let's just go ahead and do it at this moment we should have our Google project ID and our asra credentials that we got from our database so make sure you have those things handy and if you're following along we will start off with installing some python dependencies so Cedric mentioned that we will be using of course we need to import the Google Cloud platform and then this rag stack AI rag stack he just mentioned rag R A retrieval augmented generation which is our platform here at data stxs um think of it as a One-Stop shop for all of the tooling um the accessing your models communicating with your Astro Vector database um all of these operations that you will need in developing your gen application uh this self block here will take a few minutes so perfect for some time for folks to catch up and I see Thomas has beat us in sending the collab yes so I will you did so uh so here you are installing some I level package that will download all the libraries you need so the Google Cloud AI platform for all the different Vex AI clients and also another one called rstack AI so this one is actually uh built and released as open source uh by data stxs as well um so we notice that in the AI ecosystem there are a lot of um uh framework longchain is one of them um semantic anel is another lama lama index is yet another um long Smith so a lot of different specialized framework and they all know they are not well all work together so what we say let's provide something called rack stack that will kind of stick the version that we have tested and work along together and on top of that add maybe our new model uh maybe our new new features so we are we working the the different algorithm um Gil you don't have to download this it's on Google collab so it's fully hosted here you don't have to install anything so you could work directly in the collab um if you want to do it local uh with Jupiter notebook you can um and then PR of if uh just to follow up with your question for folks who are still looking for their API endpoint um just navigate to your database on Astra and then it should be on the right side under database details just copy the endpoint here and then you also need your token and if you have never used um a collab uh it's really working like jupyter notebook like any notebook you have a sucession of cells some cells are uh just um uh documentation and some cells are code that you can execute and so to execute the code each time you have a button on the left side which look like a circle with like a h YouTube play button exactly and you should if this is uh successful it will give you a green check next to it so yes and while while it's running it's um it's you know it's super obvious uh also take your time forgot to execute one cell is the most common issue you'll get with the collab because in one cell you will Define some variables that would be reused in the next cell so if you forgot one the second cannot use that yeah restart session it's not it's not that a big deal um I think Melissa you can skip or refresh both both are working yes so if you restart your session um it will bring you back to it'll just bring you back here and then you don't have to do anything after that um um Francisco you can do either either one yeah you can you can you can ask the question if we don't want answer live after that maybe you put that in Q&A and we we go after uh but we are monitoring the question so if we can answer quickly we can do so like the instruction for asra um instead of going back what I would do is I will uh uh show you the GitHub repo where there is uh again the step-by-step instruction let me go to the proper uh here we go okay so Francisco you put a question in here okay Manaj yes you do use your own API endpoint and token from the database that you have created in astrab yes so um okay so here let I think I can put your question here so uh Francisco's ask instead of using all the user input which could be a very long sentence and create you know the vector B on that question uh there is is there any technique to filter the actual question for the user input well um your question should should match to you know one one and only one vector because when you do the similarity you are comparing your question with the rest of the world um so but yeah multiple meaning it's yeah I'm I'm not sure you know the llm has a super long context window and it will uh then pick the meaning of your question I think it's doing that under the the hood right when you provide a sentence it's already picking the meaning and making a vector um yeah otherwise it's preor you have to do as you stated yeah pre-work also if you have very long prompt um people tends to say that your the main information is lost in the middle so you see the accuracy of what you are doing decreasing yeah so this is what yeah this is what I noticed good super good question yes I've also heard about semanti embeddings not so long ago I think three weeks ago we had a video to say um the this technique which is semantic embeddings to actually get you the embeddings the closest to your question and use that to to um look for your R context MH okay can I I I'll move along a little quickly here um on these next few it's um okay yeah so how many did you ex okay you you got the installation right yeah the dependencies was the one that took the longest time so I wanted to take a a moment to allow everyone to do that and then if we're all okay I will move on and Cedric yeah get yeah get the code I think you can save I mean you can totally save the file the collab is just a a python notebook file so you just save as and and it will be something you can open in jupyter Notebook yeah and and you're right it's also in the GitHub repo so if you wanted to just clone the repo and then grab the The Notebook file from there feel free to do so follow along either way yes also and I think we will have to to keep posting the uh the the GitHub repo URL time to times because people that miss the beginning are joining and this is also why we write WR why we wrote this very long R me is for people to be able to catch up okay I'm G I'm gonna move forward or a few more questions I think I think yeah I think you could you know looking at the time also we we we still want to have time to uh show bit more code instead of just import so here you're importing the Ponda yes Laura I'll go ahead and and continue here so yeah we're importing some packages that we will need um later on and then we have the load credentials uh section here so here is where you input the credentials that we saved earlier so I will get my project ID yes so uh yeah that's that's that's common pattern to do uh when you need some inputs in a in a Google collab or a notebook you proceed like that using the instruction um um get pass or input to ask live the the the user yes when you execute some code like python code those variable will be on a file called Doon and will be loaded as enironment variables because you don't want the code to know about them and the same code will run in development integration production and this is the the the architect that will just provide the file with the proper keys for security reason that's right yeah usually in practice we use a a environment file so this is just for the purpose of the collab but yeah hard coding the the the credentials is probably not your your best bet here yes Brian great function um and Felicia the project ID should be the first um one that it's asking here in the collab yeah when you execute the cell load as below ASB it will ask you yeah so when Melissa will not really really rerun the cell because otherwise she need to do the three again okay um I will move on in this next cell it's just configuring the connection between the collab and Google vertex AI so I guess this is where the local python notebook might um have some differences because you have to configure vertex AI so actually in the collab it's a lot easier when you run this cell it brings up a Google authentication window and then you can do it directly into collab so just a call out there once you got that window it should give give you the check and then you're good to move on Muhammad the project ID is in vertex AI in your project info on the top left so you have a project name and then a project ID the ID is what you need Okay so this is the fun part we are going to import the clothing data set so I have this data set here it's a Zara public data set uh living in this hugging face um you can actually visualize what the data set looks like we have the product name we have the link to the product itself we have the images etc etc um and the embeddings are already created for the for the purpose of time but this is exactly what Cedric was mentioning earlier in his in his explanation of um Astra and rags and and rag so when we do our search we are going to reference both the embeddings but also we might have some metadata that we can use to help filter our response as well so that might be the category or the gender of the item um or if you have like color season those are some additional filters that you could add to an existing data set but again the embeddings are already created and they are in this uh living in the data set already so in these next three cells we are just importing the data set and then we are storing this data set into a data frame Panda data frame and then this next cell will just allow us to see the data set here in the collab so you should see it looks exactly like the uh the hugging face data set yes so uh we got a great question we said how do we compute those embeddings because here it's true in the data set we already have the vector to get some some some some time but it's important to know so when you when you go to the model Garden to vertex AI uh or any other llm I told you there are um single purpose model the the model to do check completion the model to do imag generation the model to do text to speech it happened that there is a model or multiple model called text embeddings and this is exactly what they do you give them a string and they give you back a vector and how do they do that um it's what we call a Transformer function and there are multiple algorithms uh uh so it started with B uh by back in the day in 208 actually invented by Google we are so so so um uh yes we are so nice with Google tonight for some reason but yeah it's it's um algor um to to to compute that you don't have to do by yourself but there are also very good model that you can uh run on on your machine and it's perfectly fine uh by the way if you ask how can I use know those uh some open source model and model um without paying anything or running anything so you know Vex you got the free trial but a ging face aing face uh here we use a ging face to load our data set I think everybody does that but hugging Sals hugging face also have an inference API that you can call to do text embedding to do text completion to do image generation they even have a stable diffusion that you can use for free here J um or you can use tools like o Lama where you have like a Docker container on your machine and you say AMA run I don't know JMA 7 it will download the model almost like a doer image and run it locally as long as your your machine is big enough so here we show you all the cloud services for convenience uh but but you can also um do that locally if you want not not today uh in those 90 minute but um it's still doable okay okay so so we uh yeah so just as Cedric was explaining um how do we create the embeddings so uh like he said that it's already stored in our data set but this is just showing you briefly how that it's um how it's being done so we have are calling our vertex we're initializing our vertex AI instance and then we are taking this U multimodal embedding model and that's being stored into variable model and then what I would do is then iterate through my data frame and then you can pass through into this create embeddings function here that you want to send the image and some contextual text so this is where the multimodal piece comes in because we are using both an image and some text to generate the embedding so we are the vector embedding includes um context from both the image and then the text that is uh that we sent in this case we did the product name but you can do product description you can send in additional things here and what do those embeddings end up looking like just like this a large string of number numbers that will be used to do the searching later on yes so bra was asking can he can you do his own embeddings and the answer is uh yes you can actually invoke uh sentence Transformer uh uh python package uh you know I told you in the beginning I'm Al also a Java guy so here I provide a link how to do this in Java this is where I'm doing the most but yeah look at sent Transformer model as python package you can do it as well yeah we're Google shop today but um you can store any type of embeddings I use any embeddings model and store those into Astro okay so Manaj is asking about uh DB token and DB uh URL so maybe you can show if you have it here because it's there it's there okay it was yeah yeah if you're in the workshop I mean sorry if you were in the overview then just click your database and then it's here on the right side under database details Manaj okay okay so um here yeah very good question from s so okay so yeah very good question from s so how to choose the size of the embedding Vector because if you look open they have 15 1536 if they do have most of gini is 784 so why why uh why you know how would you do it well I told you in a vector you can uncode a certain amount of uh um meaning uh so if you can encode the meaning with the shorter possible uh Vector then all your system will be faster because if you compare two uh vector of Dimension n or two version on Dimension 2 N the complexity is increasing dramatically it's it's it's exponential uh time of comp not exponential is I think it's it's not as bad but the the the shorter the vector the better so um but for here the multimodal you need to uncode both text and images and for those most of the time uh you'll get some dimension of you know, 1500 or even 3,000 length Vector actually it's not you to choose most of the time most of the time it's not you to choose you choose a model and the model tells you which which dimension is working why I tell you most of the time because three weeks ago I mean one month ago maximum open AI where they introduce the new model called small three or big three it's like you have a very long Vector like 1,536 and you can actually ask the model to uncode as much as possible on the first 785 and when you do the embedding similarity you can only search on the first part of the vector or the W part of the vector to get more meaning in your vector so that's mostly speed and how much meaning you can have and the type of data we you you you use yes we are already image to if you Frisco if you look at what uh what question Melissa asked she was asking a question about the image because she uploaded the image in fashion B yep good question Francisco no problem see okay it's like that raging are we raging images too no we're not raging okay so what have we done up until this point everyone we have created um a data set or sorry data frame within collab that we took from the data set and I just demonstrated how the embeddings are created um although the data set already has the embeddings so let's move on to now loading that data frame into astrab so we need to First create a connection with our Vector database and that's where our en environment variables with the credentials um with the token and the endpoint that's where they come in um so we are connecting to our Vector database and then we are also creating a collection so in astb uh we have this hierarchy of database Nam space which um database which has many name spaces and then name spaces which holds collections so in this case we are creating a collection um I'll run this cell here and uh you might see that I already set the dimension and this is just based on um kind of going off of Cedric's question here with the what the llm what the embeddings model calls for okay I'm anticipating there might be some questions on the connection piece so whoever is following along um let me know if we are okay to move on here just give a couple seconds and um yeah so the the namespace is also default Nam space you can um um you can configure the namespace later but it just defaults to the default uh to the default namespace that is created with your database yeah okay getting some error yeah don't be afraid that the the key space is just a way to file your things uh 401 uh oh 41 it's probably that the token is um the yeah I'm not sure about your token maybe astrab token you miss one character at the end because 401 is really meaning you don't you you don't access the API which it seems like it's a proper URL to me yeah the URL looks fine sometimes the clipboard doesn't copy on the first time when you click it oh so it I I usually do two clicks just for good measure you might have to reenter your cral print of okay so our Vector database we've connected to it and we've created a collection as you see in our data Explorer um but now we have Zero Records so we have to load some records into this data into this collection uh so what is happening here I'll run this while I speak we are having a function called load to Astra these first few lines are just creating some visual bar on the bottom to view the progress of each record here I am going into each column from the data frame and then also establishing that as a column in Astra and saying okay product name store it under product name um price detail stored under the respective column names in Astra as well and then I need to call to my API the insert one statement and insert those uh the records as I go through the data frame so I'm using this collection. insert one statement to add those to our asra Vector database and then the exception below it's just catching if this has already um entered This Record just skip it and then you don't have any uh so you won't have any duplicates in your database and then we we call the um function so that it can load it and we pass through our data frame and than our collection that we created just a second ago if all goes well all of the records should have loaded so 936 out of 936 so that if I click back into our Astra database I should now be able to view 936 records in the collection that we created this is some yeah and if you see below we see our collection data you could see it in this table format so I see my Vector I see my columns and and so on just the same way we were seeing it in the collab but I can also see it in Json format and I can also do um if you click search on the right you can also perform some Vector searches just like this on the Fly and what's cool is that we also see the similarity scores so of course this striped shirtt if I do a search it's going to return 100% similar similarity score um and as you go down you will see other um scores that are 90% and these should be similar to the one um right above yes Muhammad a collection is an equivalent of table but in you imagine that the entries you put in a collection are gon with multiple levels where our table it's all flat so collection is exactly what you find in the DB or document oriented DB um question from manage about the error so uh this error message is related uh so it's a Google error message that's stating that when you try to access the model he was not able to have the the key to use it oh uh yeah we we did not explain how um how how to extract a g or you show how to extract a gone from the service account um from the vertex AI yeah for the Vex AI uh you didn't need to do that if you're doing it locally oh so if you're doing it locally Gil you yeah you need to configure the vertex AI API if you're doing it locally stuck in PIP install yeah yes you can you can actually copy paste as is the the the the item from it's it's it's python uh be careful not using the two recent version of python like 3.12 because all not all the AI libraries are catching up I think it's as long as you not go above 310 3 11 it's okay right okay I will move on here um into the meet of the the app so we connected to our Astra database now and now we've loaded our data set into Astra great so how do I now uh perform the actions that we will be doing when we submit some queries into this app right I want to be able to upload a photo and then from that photo it should generate some responses back to me what's happening in the background it's asking ask as ra what similar items do we have to this photo that was uploaded by the user and where are the most similar responses that we can uh return back to them uh as a response so some helper functions here just a get image um this is just a returning the image that is being uploaded by the user now we have this get image embeddings function so what is this saying it's saying that the user is uploading an image let me turn this image into an embedding so now I have this now I'm speaking the same language as my what is sored in my Vector database right the user sends me an image I translate it quote unquote into a vector and then now I can perform a vector surge back to Astra to return the most similar items so that's what's being done here um show recommendations it just shows displays that to the screen for us in the collab and then find similar items is performing what I what I just described right so we have the reference image we might have some categories so if we want to do some metadata filtering we can select what categories that we want to uh use and then we do a vector find to our collection so we give it a few parameters here we give it the embeddings limit three is just saying give me three the the top three uh similar uh top three similar items and then we could pass a metadata filter which in this case is category and then include similarity just means to display the score are we good and then I also want to just briefly call out is the prompt that we are sending as well it's um The Prompt again is you're just telling the uh llm what Persona to take on as they are responding to the question right so told it you are finding the pieces of apparel that are similar to the item um in this photo and we only care about the apparel that the item that the person is wearing not anything else in the picture good so time for some examples before we wrap up so we will first run this example one so I can choose any file that I want to upload but for this purpose I will do this example okay and you can take any file that you've uploaded and on the left side of your collab there is a um a file explorer that is in the collab that's where your uploaded image has um is living now and then you can copy this path and then put this path into the reference image cell here and then when you run it it should display that image as well as the items that we see uh the similar items that was retrieved from the database so if you remember from the beginning if you were here I demonstrated what this looked like um in the UI so same exact image and same exact results but we're just seeing it here how it's actually being done behind the scenes right so um we've given it again the image the embeddings are generated we perform a vector search and these are the top three responses that we're taken from our Astra Vector database but let's connect the dots a little bit more here let's see what the embeddings actually look like so if I oops I need to update this path so if I call my get image embeddings it should give me the um the vector that was actually generated from the uploaded image I can copy this and then go back into my Astro database and let's use this hybrid search feature that we have in our database uh database sorry data Explorer and I can put in the vector that I just generated from my uploaded response and click apply and lo and behold we see some the same products that we got as a response here so you might see the mules the bag um the sorry the mules the bag and the cross body bag and then same thing here we see mules the bag the crossbody bag as well so cool cool that we were able to see what is what is the um what is the what is the database seeing after we upload the photo right it's only seeing this Vector right we are generating the embedding and then we are talking to Astra and telling it here what it needs to look for and then it's just simply returning us the responses but to us it's uh giving us some recommendations based on the outfit that we are you're giving it and below here are some more examples where you can use even just the URL so different image same idea um but this time I'm passing in categories as metadata right so now I can tell it I only want to see some responses within the categories tops bottoms and outerware and if I scroll below scroll below it should give us category tops and then some items within tops some items within bottoms and in in the outer wear as well I know we had to move a little bit quickly um if there are any other questions in regards to the collab let me know yeah for now we we we C up great great that that was the collab everyone um if you have any more questions you can always follow up with us there um but I think we will head back into but basically this was fashion buddy did it seem as hard as we thought from the beginning to create something like that how did you upload the image yeah how did you upload the image so if you go here um shy to the example piece it is actually asking for an uploaded image in this cell from Google collab files uploaded files upload thank you Laura thank you Prana I'll go ahead and Shop stop sharing now okay so let me uh start sharing and uh move so uh we are still 15 minutes so I will um I will go a little bit on uh slide as we do a little bit of code but I would like to um you know save five minutes to play the little game right I I want somebody here to win a t-shirt so I have one word so we did a collab and so the app we build are using some orchestration framework the framework that's doing the glue with everything you we we discuss connecting to the llm connecting to the database so the database in the case of vector is called also called a store of a vector store uh and also all different features that you would need in a chatbot like endling the chat endlink the memory and for that so longchain Lama index setil carel are definitely the more um the more famous in Python if you are using uh Java longchain for spring um spring um uh spring Ai and if you are using no GS typescript uh long GS L index GS now they they also have it so I also introduce you to rstack AI this is what we import at the very beginning we try to stick together the framework that work the best and like we tried that you import a single uh library and it get you everything you need so with this use case we can build a recommander because the recommander is find me what is the closest to me here I put a little uh sphere because you can see that your product catalog on the graph and you know a vector store a vector database when you save your vector it's a vector space so your each Vector is a point and you keep trying to see what are the closest to you it's not in dimension three but you got the ID um so yeah it's so to get a recommendation you can do as a similarity search plus meta filtering it is getting more and more okay so um after that what we have as a homework for you or going uh uh over so we swap the Google collab with stream lit so if I go to the uh GitHub uh repo so we uh here we did Lab One lab two and if I go to lab three uh so again we do not want you to install anything so they ask you first to create an account in that uh system called stream lit so you know it's free just need a Google account a GitHub account I think and uh uh there actually using the repo itself and use open Cod space so you know to do that you go here Cod space and you click on the little plus and it will open a full-fledged ID on internet for you to actually work and uh Implement a real app so if you look at the repo the main file you need to look is this file called fashion bupi which contain the full fashionbody application if if you look at the first rows here you will see that it's all about importing the credentials this time not by providing them but because they are in a file called secret. TL so here you provide you substitute the value and it's loaded then this line is really connect to the database create a collection uh that's just the constant and here a few function which are the function from the collab so you have your data you have the function from the collab you load the credentials how to build the app this is where stream L come into play so it's a framework really oriented to do user interface uh for chatbot and Ai and they come with this prefix St and if you do st. title st. WR it will directly show you stuff in the user interface to load an image in the user interface you just do STD image is almost doing HTML right it's a list of tag where you decide what one what we want to do and the sidebar is the same the upload file the the block to upload file is the same so it's Al it's almost like uh advance form and what you have to do is wire the control so when you upload a document from this UI invoke the function that we Define in the collab and it's it's not more complicated than that and if you want to do it step by step you will see that um uh we we explain the command to to so it's it's creating the the account it's it's really go to the ah okay I will I will get I will I will get to the I will get here okay it's okay okay let's keep moving all right so you go to the streamlit folder you create a file called secret. jison which is uh coming from the secret account for Google you create this environment variable you substitute the value and you can just do stream L run the app and you will have it running in the ID don't have to install anything it's another way to represent what we did not with the collab but with streamlit okay uh yeah I I was fast on this part but you know it it would have been a bit disappointed not to show a bit more code and go to this streamly part okay yeah all right uh you know I think you as you did the demo in the beginning you know I think we can we can move here and use the remaining time for uh us to have a little fun if you if you all agree so to play the game actually is super simple you uh go with your phone uh open a brother and uh enter the C go to m.com enter the code or you scan the QR code just that can I enter to Cedric say it again can I enter too but you will win so the idea is that um you will see a few uh question on the screen okay and if you answer fast and answer correctly you get the most point and we will see on the screen who answer faster and when we done in 5 minute very quick um you send me an email with your coordinates and I ship you a copy of that tissue right uh it's always good to end our little endone with a little fun like that so I see on my screen that we are already 21 uh so yeah keep going we you have one chance in 21 to to go um I will keep the instruction one more minute and uh I will start just to be on time okay yes provin he hasn't started the no no no I've not started the the the the thing uh also the question will show first on your phone so if you're watching from one of the panel which is linked in YouTube maybe you have two second delay so make sure to check your phone because your phone will be the most uh the most up to date okay um I think podcast is like the direct direct and YouTube has one second okay so the first question is uh not even a question from the quiz is really uh where are you from I mean uh we we dial at this time so and we want to see uh where where are people from oh wow so we see people from uh southeast Asia wow congratulations I actually at Singapore right now and it's 2 a.m. so thank you for staying with with us so late you're not alone you're not alone look at that and see so it's a distributed framework yeah I'm so happy to see that we have contact all across the all over the place and look at that we have spent 90 minute all together and we are almost still 50 online at the end so pretty happy that um we do that way okay so now let's do the quiz I I I I want to uh end of time and on time okay so question one4 oh 60 63 that's craziness okay so uh answer fast to get more PHS first you get the question and then you it's you get uh four answer uh and pick one of those okay so good luck let's see these questions what is the name of the database we use today is it ASB Pine Cor we wait a Victor it's it's it it it's supposed to reward everyone that attend okay this one was too easy sorry so let's see the leatherboard and this is how you see uh who was the fastest so look at that oh it's pretty tough look at that but this time by two millisecond it was Joe pragash uh maybe you're real name so yeah thank you okay question number two are you ready let's go what framework can be used to orchestrate a generative application long flame long flow long chain long G GS you have some tricked answers in here Cedric is there any he he hey yes I told you about long chain that's right but there is another way to orchestrate which is visual using longf flow also owned by data stack so maybe for the next Workshop you won't even have a python code but it was just dragging some arrows in between blocks to do a rag application okay so this time let's see the leatherboard oh oh oh oh oh oh I think left site was fast is it enough oh yeah it was enough left side took the lead okay question number three everybody ready oh we have even more player now 67 ready to go how do we describe an AI model that accept itous input type multilangual multimodal multitype oh noct I think this one's this one's a hard one no I think it's so right nobody's okay this time okay next next next walkshop I will make my question way more complicated folks but I'm not here to trick you I need to you know to have fun okay look look at CL yeah not only is wow okay okay it's so close all right last question yeah I I wanted to to take short okay uh good luck everyone and for fast to get more points what is the name of the Python framework I describ at the end to build real application with web interface streamlit streamy jungle delete actually I I we didn't have enough time for some more jokes from you today s right see I I I'm thinking some some some yeah so jungle was a kind of a trap because yeah we explain stream L and if you join late you know uh yeah that's a reward okay so that's the final lebard so uh let's see who got his or her t-shirt and um okay love site cannot be beaten today so it took a little second question and it's our winner so congratulation so how to reach out to me um he he oh um okay so I will uh so uh uh yeah to reach out to me yeah my yeah my email is U yeah how do I reach out to me um um Le side if you're here can you just uh share your email share an email to melis signs and we will contact back to you okay and take a picture like you know showing you you want I I thought I put my email there uh which is sx.com but you know we never know uh so with that as I told you oh Michelle Michelle sent your email website um so if you could send an email to Michelle nice thank you Michelle you you saved me okay so um everything is on GitHub you saw that if you enjoy the content and you want to see more session like that consider to subscribe to the YouTube channel at least uh and also we have a Discord uh where you can we can answer question to you after uh the the workshop okay or if you now you are watching a recording you can reach out to us on this Discord and we will be there to answer our question and with that I think we are just on time so it's just a time to thank you all and maybe Maya you have a last word yeah again thank you everyone for tuning in I hope you enjoyed following along with us if there are any questions and regarding the collab or the streamlet site as well um feel free to email my myself or Cedric and I'll be happy to answer your questions we're always looking to um improve on on our workshops as well so please provide any feedback um I yeah thank you again and thank you Cedric for joining so late in the hours of Singapore over there all right now my pleasure talk to you soon have a nice one",
