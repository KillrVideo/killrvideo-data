    "text": "foreign [Music] I'm the real-time AI product and strategy leader at datastacks and here with me I have Brian as the BPO strategy and data Stacks with a long history of working with business and technology leaders on digital transformation and AI strategy it's really good to have you here I'm very excited about this conversation glad to be here uh let's start with you um so I know that you've been thinking deeply lately about challenges and risks in this space the agent space the AI space the generative AI space and um we were talking to our CEO the other day and we know that he's talked about how we believe we reach our best future of AI for all fastest if the right people who want to do the right things in the right way can learn by doing so how can we mitigate those risks and manage challenges when so many people are working on AI yeah I think that that's a great question and I think you know it's worth thinking about this in the context of the opportunity the risks and the challenges and the precedent we have right so if you think about smartphones about 85 penetration worldwide with smartphones right yeah there's no reason why AI won't be a hundred percent worldwide and certainly in everybody's organization right so if you didn't start to think about that you know you kind of back into look AI will redefine Industries where your company sits will depend on what you do with AI we know it's going to be part of everybody's job both doing their own work and serving their internal external customers so the sooner you Embrace that and say yes it's a hundred percent of everybody's job um then you start to think about how do you do that safely you know how do you do that right and I think one pillar we think about is openness right being explicit this is the journey we're on it's all part of our jobs and we're all learning how to do it um and I think there's you know there's a couple angles on that one is we all know the pain of technical debt if we've been around in in technology you've got the chance not just to avoid technical debt as you start off on this journey by doing it right but you know use AI to document every meeting create the body of knowledge and text and data about all the questions people ask you know what harm could we do how would we know um what level of trust are we trying to achieve what would have to be true to achieve that you're actually creating a body of knowledge you can point AI at right the faster you proceed by learning by doing carefully cautiously you actually build this possibility of an AI agent to help people do AI organization with your context with your customers you know in the geographies you operate that's bespoke to you um and then I think you know so many people working on it then gets back again to openness ensure everybody feels like they can do their work in the open right including surfacing a question of we're not sure how to achieve this level of trust right we don't know how we would detect this type of harm um and then it shouldn't be going alone in your organization and your organization shouldn't go it alone right like whatever vertical you're in you probably lean into understanding you know Trends in consumer marketing and participate maybe in an academic body or you know Trends in financial regulation and you go to those those bodies and you've got experts do the same for AI right in each uh company but also each function each vertical uh or each line of business lean into picking up the phone or engaging with folks um I think you know we all see and I mean we meaning business government Academia we all see the potential if you reach out to talk about what you want to do with AI as an organization and people will probably be very interested in talking to you yeah that is definitely I mean in my experience recently been the case anytime I've reached out to want to talk about it people are engaging it we're all learning this together and so but the topics like some of the words you just use safety and trustworthiness it seems like those are key where you know we have to there's there are feelings we're trying to evoke right feelings of safety feelings of trust so how do we sort of Ensure we're building for safety and for trust versus kind of doing it after the fact yes absolutely I think you know one two two other things I think about a lot are the sense of being Mission driven and context aware um and so you know every time you're going to deploy an AI you are entailing some risk right the return will be higher for those things that really deliver on your brand promise that connect to what customers really want from you right so so first off is thinking about what's going to give us the highest return for the level of risk we take right and sort of lean into what what do folks really value from us right yeah and and the second is you're going to do best probably at what you know well right so stay aware of the context are you reaching outside of the context where you've got good customer knowledge and intimacy and domain expertise um probably not the first AIS you want to deploy right figure out how you can enrich or extend what you know well um which will then Pro you know if you learn how to deliver safe trustworthy experiences in a space that's defined and scoped the tools you learn the techniques you learn right the the ways to measure and monitor you learn will probably build your skills on you know okay maybe we're now going to extend into more foreign territory but the foreign territory shouldn't be your first foray right right since so if we're if we're putting this in this thing today or Partners or architects what are some maybe more concrete actions they can take that can help yeah that's a great question I think you know the the bottom line is as a technical practitioner and architect your organization can't do this without you can't succeed at safety and Trust without you your your skills are critical but also cross-functional teams is already an established pattern for success and I think becomes even more important in when you think about generative AI where there's probabilistic interaction you know with the end user right lots of things start to matter you know everything from you know their brand perception of you to their age to their reading level to you know cultural nuances and so as a technologist you know a service you can do not only to your organization but to yourself is to really emphasize that the path to success for this type of application is a diverse team a cross-functional team is you know making rustling with or chasing down the qualitative dimensions of things just a first order you know task and not something you've you know we figured out how to deploy a capability let's sort of shoehorn it into what we think will work like no build build from the customer build from that emotion you want to create and of course at the end of the day the prize for this is you know obviously losing trust is bad but the prize is if you build trust people will be willing to share that much more data with you over time which you know is is the route to competitive Advantage right right exactly and I mean as practitioners we all want more data for all of those answers we're trying to come up with and getting a more complete picture of you know our users and things like that right uh on that on that note uh you know I know there's actually a body of knowledge under the cognitive handle of responsible AI that you are extremely well versed in and do a lot of thinking thinking about um and I think it's important to surface that you don't have to reinvent the wheel here um you should stand on the shoulders of giants um so you tell me a little about you know how would you express your point of view on responsible Ai and what that means to folks who are listening yeah I mean we may have heard about this in in several different ways over the last couple of years right it may be responsibility or ethics or transparency accountability they're all kind of interconnected and they can't really exist in a vacuum um basically anything that we do with AI is going to impact people and process and Technology I tend to think about this instead of about you know AI like just responsibility in general because what we're trying to do is drive Behavior change some change in some outcomes so it means that we have to consider the people the behaviors trying to drive and the ethics of that in the products that we're making intended to create change so for me part of ensuring something is ethical um since there are no real like objective values is this consumable communication to the reader so what you were talking about earlier where it's not just that you can willy-nilly make some someone go do something that you want them to do that that is not ethical if it's not aligned with you know their intention or their goal or some of their values in some way and so like you said we can stand on the shoulders and Giants here and look into things like um behavioral psychology like um products that create change there are a lot of books out there that we can read about this Behavior change I mean I think most of us well I'm dating myself most of us remember um like when like using cigarettes and different things in movies were banned yes unless right we made it look cool but the the impact of the sort of promoting this was that people were like oh I'm cool that if they're not thinking about like it caused me death that sort of a thing so we have to be careful with AI in that regard as well are there a couple examples that you would cite about you know what it means to to build responsibly yeah I mean I like to think kind of of responsible and irresponsible and so irresponsible examples are a little easier for me to kind of pull out so um and maybe I can just negate them as we're talking so I I would find it irresponsible especially in AI if you didn't provide some sort of feedback loop right AI is learning from the data and learning from different outcomes and so if you're not providing any mechanisms for closing that feedback loop like you're keeping um your idea of someone or the state of the world constant there's no change that would be irresponsible we know I mean just look at how things are so rapidly changing we know language changes over time we know that who a person is doesn't equate to the order of like credit rights or things like that we don't know how things are going to change and we don't know what kind of Concepts we're using today that should not be codified so it would be very irresponsible to keep sort of that feedback loop broken yeah and then I love that example because you know if you think about you know however let's call it a manipulative system to stay in the irresponsible Zone however effective it is today if it's not a learning system it may become less effective and now obviously the win-win is you're not manipulative but you are a learning system and you kind of miss the boat if you're not a learning system yeah yeah and I think part of this openness that you were talking about before also applies to telling the end user about how you're updating this data how you're updating the model so you you have to communicate the assumptions that you took when you built the model uh the motivations that you had in order to like change the behavior this this idea of trust um it doesn't come with secrecy right I don't know like we can think about just like teaching our children how to trust other people like it comes from a hundred thousand little interactions so that we can kind of build this up over time and that's going to be with communication that's just yes yeah and I think in the moment we're in it's actually pretty fascinating I think you're hitting on something which people should lean into because you know in the past lots of folks weren't really aware of how AI was working in the background but now because of generative AI because AI will be in every you know every Microsoft Office or every Google app your customers will understand that they're interacting with AI and you can actually disclose this information and they'll get it right and that that's uh that's an opportunity really um so to bring this back to the final question you asked me um you know what advice do you have for the practitioners and architects in our audience yeah I think in general when I think of responsibility it's a it's a shared framework we all have some responsibility in this our users our Builders the providers of the technology collectors and providers of data there's some level of responsibility and similar to what you were saying I would encourage the practitioners to understand where do they sit in terms of what they're accountable for and who they're accountable to if you're building something that's going to impact an end user are you building in mechanisms for communicating the risks to the user that's associated with using the content that's being generated with your app or maybe that what your application May prevent them from doing you know what what are you communicating and how are you letting that sort of come out in your end user experience as you're building but also part of what you're doing by exposing this information and building in a more transparent and open way is you're enabling your end users to take part in their own responsibility as part of this shared responsibility model right so you know there are ways to do this whether it's you know terms of services not the way that you're going to communicate this to your end user you need these simple experiences that are understandable that allow a user to know like hey I just saw this friend recommendation maybe you have a little pop-up that said where did this recommendation come from or how did it get here letting them opt in and out of different components of your experience and applications so yeah I would yeah mostly encourage like individualize put yourself in that ecosystem of shared trust and responsibility and I love the scoping and the contextualization because you know we've got these models now that we can interact with and have a conversation about anything that's not why your customers come to you right right don't come for some generic all-encompassing thing they come for something specific where you can hone in on oh a great feedback mechanism for this specific interaction is this because they're not here to chat about all things under the sun right I mean that brings us to the Practical example that we were using earlier in our earlier assessments we saw a demo of an AI agent that data Stacks built and so maybe we should go into some of the considerations that they had and learnings from that experience to kind of help contextualize this to you know the agent we did sounds great so yeah so um I think the first thing um when I spoke with a team that they were considering is like you said what's the customer experience what what part of our brand and what part of our business requirements are actually going into this agent because we knew that our agents had to be as effective as our current support and sales teams right our current human chat is critical in go to market like we are a developer Community like most of our all of our products are open source and so everything we do it's critical that we are having that that communication experience and so when we were thinking about like what the requirements are that was going to be a very important part of the brand experience as sort of that primary interaction um you know from a business perspective it's going to impact that promoter score and other things like that right but also you know as as we were thinking about that we were thinking like okay well what are the mitigation steps we need to take and to your point earlier we were we had to like limit the audience first we needed to run tests we only deployed the first assistant to like a small percentage of our audience and we put in some checks there right we had human review um so we're we're still working on this and we're going to experiment with the agent um but the the human part of that loop we're keeping intact because we need to kind of like as we expand outside of chat to writing emails and other multimodal agents we need this sort of expert review to make sure that you know the audience that we're speaking to and the brand as it's being represented is still within you know what's acceptable to us yes absolutely and I think you know there's a there's a there's a human side of cross-functional teams as a pattern for success but there's a there's another side which is you know no one goes it alone that includes the AIS yes right there's just no AI that doesn't have a steward a shepherd on an ongoing basis exactly yeah exactly the pii so you know when you were thinking about that with this application what kind of things did we hit there yeah I mean so I think this the support is very interesting because as a as a SAS company a cloud company we've of course got all kinds of operational data we've got data about the customers the customers are communicating data about their situation in the support chat and so you really have to think about you know isolating users um and and even also you know putting boundaries around around what type of user information winds up getting into the system so no Pai you know anonymizing games um you know you don't want to create traces of individual users that can be identified in the data set you're building right yeah um and you have to you know and and you know one of the things I love about the the system we're building is of course you know uh uh Apache Cassandra data stack to asteroid can be used to give an LM memory essentially but you need to scope that context that you're using that user's history um and exclusively that user's history to provide context um and so I think the team did a pretty thoughtful job about building the the boundaries and boundary conditions around all that yeah yeah for sure and I know that there was quite a bit of work around the sort of feature engineering side of that right because you're trying to summarize you know this user's experience in history but also contextualize it into what have people at this stage of their journey journey done yes and so that's kind of a you know like you're saying anonymization but also engineering the right features to provide context was incredibly important yes right yes absolutely um but for all the engineering we did as you mentioned humans are still in the loop in a couple different ways and we've got I think both some automated triggers um and some human interventions uh in terms of sentiments and escalation can you talk about that a little bit yeah yeah so um part of what we knew like I said before is that that Human Experience is very important and we needed to be able to know when was the right moment to escalate to a human if a user has like said something negative to the chatbot no you know certainly sometimes users are going to just play with a bot and see like what's going on right um but the difference between I think a bot and an agent is an agent knows when to escalate they've you know looked at the sentiment of what's Happening they've sort of seen a journey in there and they're like ah I can't handle this anymore right it's sort of this idea we talked about where it's like an agent can act on your behalf a lot but they can't they can't do everything right they they kind of know when to give it back to you um yes and we also had a little bit of um uh intense detection in there as well so if there was started to be questions around not just like how do I use this product how do I get unblocked but around like pricing and how would I actually put this into other things then we would bring them to an expert in that area because that's not what this agent was trained on right they were trained on how to assist not how to sell so yeah other kinds of triggers right so that and that that's actually a really wonderful example about respecting user intent which is we're not actually trying to use this interaction to persuade someone who's not here to buy to buy but if they wind up coming through this Channel and that's what they're trying to do right we will quickly connect them to the right resource which I think is a great example of you know the opposite of manipulative it's respecting and detecting if they're in the wrong place and helping them out right it you know in any business if you're trying to manipulate someone to buy something and it's not actually something they need like you're going to lose that business you don't want that kind of negative experience so consider consider not doing that yes so so hallucinations we hear a lot about them everyone's afraid of them it's a really hard problem I know we're always working on it um how have we been handling it today um I think there's you know a lot of you know prompt engineering and prompt testing um and I think there's also the humans come into play right because we are actually devoting human time and effort to reviewing and tagging hallucinations right yeah yeah I think there is a whole team in the beginning who was doing this and now we can sort of escalate the more likely hallucinations but yeah it's such a hard problem and I'm sure you know the industry is going to find better and better ways to do this but the the point of generative AI is to create new content and so you have to be pretty careful about what is real what's actually you know coming from your support docs versus something that's like it'd be cool if we had this but we don't actually have that feature today please don't tell in users about it right right right you know this this thing ties back to you know yes hallucinations are at risk of learning by doing but by learning by doing responsibly and diligently you start to understand the interaction of you know your particular data and their domain and what types of hallucinations get produced and how you can detect and prevent them and so you know as generic tools you know general purpose tools evolve in the ecosystem you'll also have a leg up on kind of understanding you know how do hallucinations surface in our context and that's better to have done that by learning by doing and including investing in some human you know oversight time than to start out from from Square zero you know down the road yeah well um I know that we're about points we're going to talk about response format and relevancy and testing and metrics maybe we do that in shorter than what we wanted to because we got a little deep in some of these things I'll just like give a few points um so you don't just need to get an out of the box right we knew that we had to tune various things like temperature like the degree of Randomness versus a varied um an unexpected response and mistakes and nonsense Etc like you can tune these different settings between zero and one there were other things that we had to like EK values P values different prompt settings that controlled the dispersion and the content and the creativity of the answers um and so when you tell a prompt like you should only answer a customer questions about Cassandra data stacks and its products that means that the user isn't going to be able to ask the irrelevant questions that are not pertaining to what this agent's expertise is and so we definitely consider putting some of those guardrails on um and I know um it this is going to just continue as we start to make these specialized agents across our product experience yeah without any last remarks Brian before we let everyone go uh no it's just been a pleasure uh talking to you and I hope folks take away that you know there's work to be done there's caution that you need to be take but it is doable right and you can start to think about use cases and agents um and again learn by doing documenting um and the doing being the shepherding and management after the fact as well well thanks so much I'll see you guys next time Take Care thank you [Music]",
