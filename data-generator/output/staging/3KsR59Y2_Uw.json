    "text": "cool so let us know perfect thanks very much guys everybody and i think excuse us for a moment while we i'll hand the controls back to let's stop sharing you all right so what are we going to cover today well we're going to go over some basic use case data models type stuff then we're actually going to go ahead and set up our astra and get our schema set up and built out then we're going to connect with the driver to astra and then we're going to run our crud operation so nothing too crazy today it should be pretty easy to follow along um if you get a little behind you know just all the instructions are in the git hub you'll be able to catch up just fine um and we can just kind of get through this together um as a group so uh yeah with that let's take a look all right so the app here if you've seen it before um if anyone was part of our eight week series you're probably very familiar with this app um this is the the spaceship app it's basically uh kind of an iot style workload where we have a spaceship that presumably has a ton of different sensors obviously we're spoofing them we're not actually launching a spaceship here today but it has a bunch of different sensors that are sending data back and we're storing those into sandra um and then retrieving them from cassandra and doing various things so um we're not actually going to use a gui on our spaceship app we're just going to simulate it with a bunch of scripts that we're going to be picking through and working with here all right so designing your data model um we say this i think every single workshop but we basically take relational data modeling we flip it on its head where we start with our application now we we actually build out our queries based on what our application needs to consume and then we build our data model based on our query so we're denormalizing we're kind of taking a top-down approach um from application all the way down to the database layer um so what that means is we actually have to sit and figure out what our application needs to run so what are our queries going to be and and how is data going to be consumed if we answer that question we can build out our data model so we need to actually um i always use a whiteboard for this when i'm actually working through it with someone but basically we'll just start you know with uh what are the different questions we have and what are the different parts of those questions so for here we have journey um we're gonna have some sort of a spacecraft name or id some identifier for a spacecraft we're gonna have a status so if it's you know an active journey or maybe it's a completed journey or maybe it's planned or something along those lines we're gonna have a summary so that would be you know any sort of like mission log notes something like that um start time and time and then a unique identifier for that particular journey um we're also going to have all these other things off on the the right hand side we're going to have these sensors that are all going to be feeding data back and what we're going to do is we're going to put each of those sensor types into its own table so in this particular case i think we have one of each kind of sensor so we're going to have reading speed reading time read unit all of these things are going to be stored in their own tables and that's that's denormalization the reason we're doing that is it's very very efficient on data retrieval where we can just run a direct query without any joins without anything like that because cassandra doesn't have join so we're able to run these direct queries and get data back very very efficiently very very quickly um and you know you can run analytics you can run all sorts of things against the data you're getting back all right so application workflow so spacecraft we're going to need to do a couple different things we're gonna need to look up all of the journeys from a particular spacecraft so we're gonna be able to basically provide a spacecraft id uh and then get all of the journeys associated with that spacecraft we're gonna need to look at the state of a journey so i've i've looked up all the journeys for the spacecraft that one interests me i want to get more information on that one so we're going to do some sort of a select based off of the journey id next we're going to need to create a new journey so basically go in and create a new a journey id put in all populate all the info from the spacecraft name all the different pieces and then have that info retrievable all right sensor readings and queries these are all of those sensors again so this this is basically on all of your iot style things in the app so as these sensors are you know updating once every so many seconds every time interval they're going to be sending data back we need a place to short and retrieve that data um let's see i think it says here yep there it is less than 100 records per journey per dimension so um dimension there being um you know our uh our inter-dimensional space travel i think um all right so moving on here we go there's a bit of lag here for me all right there we go um so what does this mean this means we're going to need a lot of different tables we're going to need a spacecraft journey catalog which that's going to be where we're starting all of our journeys if we want to look up something based on our journey we're going to need to look there we're also going to need one individual table for each of our sensors so we've got spacecraft temperature over time speed over time location over time and pressure over time so each of those corresponds to a particular sensor type okay what do those actually look like then sorry the two at the top there we are actually showing you on this slide we'll get to those on the next slide but uh basically what we have here is spacecraft name is going to be what's called our partition key um in in cassandra we're not going to get too deep into this but in cassandra things are partitioned based on the data you can kind of think of it as a giant distributed hashmap based on this partition key and that's how data is automatically distributed for you you don't actually have to sit there and manually slice up your data and send it to different places because cassandra is smart enough to do it based off this partition key so spacecraft name is going to be the partition key and then the clustering column which is an ordering column within a partition is going to be the journey id now the other cool thing to note here is that when you have a primary key construction um you can actually control some of the behavior of your database so um we have we have a really good session i think it was is it two weeks ago that we did our our cassandra basics uh bettina uh it was last week actually okay yes if and three weeks ago yes yeah we've done it a couple times if you want more info on how this works i highly recommend you look into it go check out that session it's recorded it's on youtube um we do a much much deeper dive than we're gonna do today and we will actually cover why these different things are important and how to actually data model on a little bit of a deeper level than we're really going to get into here so definitely go check those out okay we got our our spacecraft speed over time um which uh you can see there it's got two of those k's the k is again it designates the partition key what that's basically saying is it's called a part composite partition key which is where we're taking two values they're getting added together before you getting hash and that you know hash map partitioning method so um those are both part of our our partition key both of them have to be provided for us to retrieve data partition keys always need to be provided in your where clause for you to get data back that's the simplest way to look at it um without understanding any of the back end just you always need to provide your partition key to get your data back it's the question the data the payload is the answer okay so and then the answer in this case would be speed and speed unit with of course reading time being our clustering column or how we're ordering it since we want to order it based on the time that sensor actually read the data all right and and actually the the tables for temperature and location they look exactly the same right so they basically have and that's why we don't display them so we just basically have four dimensions we've got speed temperature location pressure and we're recording you know at um in a very rapid intervals you know the journey telemetry details basically right so those look exactly the same yeah and so i'm not going to go through the pressure here because again just like matina said it's the same exact thing all right so now we need to look at some types data types they're important right um all right i'll start here on the spacecraft journey catalog um the name obviously that's gotta be text text is basically your equivalent of like a varchar or or you know kind of the the char equivalent in a lot of other databases um it is basically string yeah that's that's the other um it's the one type that handles all of those things you don't need to specify a length on it you don't need to do anything like that you just use type text and you're good to go um journey id is a time uuid which is a very very cool type because it's basically a uuid which is a unique identifier number but then with an embedded timestamp that can be ordered so you can actually go through and you can actually order things based off of these unique identifier numbers given the fact that they they store this timestamp to them really really nifty um super super cool tool and actually simplifies a lot of the things around data modeling um later on but again not getting into that if you want to see more on that um check out uh last week's session all right so we got start time and time which are both going to be time stamps we've got active which is a boolean so basically true false and then summary which is of course another text so that's probably a short little paragraph of went here did that came home that sort of thing um same sort of thing for the sensor tables again i'm only going to cover one of them because they're all essentially the same table just with different um a different thing you know the pressure versus speed versus location um contained within them so um there we have spacecraft name which of course again is text we have a journey id which again is that time uuid notice both of those values are actually stored in the spacecraft journey catalog so that's kind of an interesting point and we're not going to get too deep into that either but for now understand that we're not doing any joining we're actually going to um probably what this would look like from like an application standpoint where i programming a ui or some sort of a dashboard on top of this is i would click on a journey from the journey catalog and then it would actually run another select statement using the journey id and the spacecraft name so you can actually retrieve stuff that way it's pretty cool um okay reading time time stamp and then of course speed and then speed unit which are double in it respectively okay that was a lot um all right you get to do it yourself in the moment yes we'll get to try it all right so create table if not exists this is your standard create table statement this is basically uh exactly what you think it is similar to almost any other database you'd use out there you have a key space which we'll create in a moment and that's a bucket that stores tables then you have your tables then you have your data in the tables you know stored rows and columns and then of course like i said that that thing earlier about partitioning all those rows are chunked into these blocks called partitions and those are distributed so but from your standpoint it's just a nice rows and columns you can run selects like you think you would you can get your data back and result sets like you think you would it should feel very comfortable to anyone who has run a relational database in the past um you're gonna feel right at home here um you know as long as you're understanding the denormalized nature of things so all right so we're gonna do a create table like this spacecraft journey catalog uh and then we're gonna go through we're gonna define our our attributes and their types um then we're gonna build that primary key now this is where the magic is so remember how we said the primary key determines partition and ordering you see there the partition key is that spacecraft name and it is in an extra set of parentheses that basically just says hey this is the partition key use this value and and do your hashing based off that then your journey id is outside and you know it's got the comma journey id and it's outside that that uh what do you call it inner parentheses set i suppose um that is basically saying that this is a clustering column this is how what we want to use to order our data and i believe uh patina by default it's descending right is that is that correct i think by default is outstanding okay now okay and um but that might be wrong yeah it's okay so and then of course with clustering order by and then journey descending if you wanted to manually set an order on that so that's would basically give us when if you if you look at the partition that would give us the most recent journey first and then the the you know the later ones so um that's really so you would retrieve everything for one spacecraft and you would see the different journeys that this spacecraft has taken okay so now we have the other table which is the sensor table and i'm only going to show i think one example of this just again because they're so similar to one another we have our spacecraft name journey id all of it's set up the exact same way but you remember that composite partition key i mentioned earlier that's how you denote one right there you'll notice those inner parentheses actually have two values so they have spacecraft name comma journey id that is due to the the or that is how you uh denote goodness words aren't working for me today that is how you denote that it is a composite partition key and we still have a clustering column there you see reading time is again outside of those inner parentheses so that's kind of how you set up your table structure it's really not that difficult once you do it once or twice it should feel very comfortable um there's nothing nothing crazy there to understand really okay so yeah we've got one because we get this question all the time you know how do we deal with udts user defined types so we've got an example here and then we see it later in the code how do you deal with that i thought it was interesting to include that yeah yeah so udt is just like bettina said user defined type essentially if there is something you wanted to store and you wanted to do it in a single cell but you had maybe um multiple data so say maybe you have a user database and you have an address or something associated with a person you could potentially store that as a udt and essentially what we're doing here is we're defining so create type if not exists location udt and that's just an xyz coordinate so a three dimensional space coordinate and so when i insert data i'm going to provide an xyz coordinate it's going to store that in a single cell gonna be retrievable by a single cell um and giving me my data back it's kind of the simplest simplest way to explain it there's a little more complexity when you get into some really advanced stuff with them but for now just just think of it as storing multiple values within a single cell multiple related values within a single cell don't try to go and make a database in a database though i'm like trying to nest all sorts of stuff and yeah yeah that's a pitfall i've seen people fall into before where they go oh great i can i can return everything from one cell and then it just turns into a mess yeah they're not they're not silver bullets right so it's just um but i think the you know the drivers actually handle these things a little bit differently so it's worth exploring it in the examples that we have but you know it's not something that you know don't fall in love with user-defined types right so it's they make things extra complex but it's worth pointing out how it works absolutely okay i'm gonna go ahead here and go to the next oh there it goes okay so when i actually want to use this udt what i'm going to do is you'll notice there under location i've got that frozen and then location udt type since i've already created that udt type in my database it understands that that is what i'm using and it will actually go and and take those three values and it handles all that for me i don't have to do anything else i just insert my data retrieve my data good to go simple as that and the frozen just means it has as one block right so it always expects x y and z right so it's the just don't flip over that keyword but it's just one blob of data basically there yes absolutely okay so got through all that we get that's good yes so what is astra astra is what we're using today it basically allows us to get rid of a lot of the time we would have spent uh setting up our database um you know previously in years gone by we would spend half the day set standing up cassandra so that we could run a couple credit operations we don't have to do that anymore this is a fully managed self-service database so cassandra is the back end of astra everything on astra is basically running on cassandra um there's no commitment we're not taking credit cards or anything today we're not you know using this for marketing literature or anything like that or sorry marketing emails or anything like that um there's a free tier we're gonna use the free tier it's five gigabytes um always there until astra goes away basically um it's just a way to eliminate the operations for today so we get straight into the code so all right so if you made an aster database in a previous workshop feel free to keep that our code is very friendly we'll just have to change like two values and i'll point them out when we get there um you'll just change two values to match whatever it was you created previously um if you haven't created one that's okay i'm gonna walk through it with you and you can follow along step by step and we'll get through it okay um i am going to see hands on exercise create astra database cool so i'm gonna go back over here um so the github was linked earlier hopefully everyone here had it um you'll know i think you might want to make that a little bit bigger eric i think it's a bit smaller let me increase is that better to me that looks good so let's see what our friends say on youtube let us know if it's good enough yeah if it needs to be expanded i can always i always make it a little bigger okay so we're going to scroll down here now first thing i want to point out you've got a table of contents if you're doing node.js or if you're doing python we'll click on those links later so not right now just know that that's where they are and that's easy to get there if you if you click on there all right first thing we're going to do is we're going to go to astra now you can click here and it will leave you there i was a little sneaky earlier and i already am there although i think i do need to re-authenticate because i've had it sitting open oh no cool all right so when you get to this page it should look like this you'll have your account you can see i'm logged in i don't have any databases which is totally fine because we're going to go ahead and hit that add database button right there i'm going to select the free tier i'm going to go down i'm going to make sure google cloud is selected now this next part select the one that's closest to you geographically for me i'm in the us so i'm going to do us east but if you were in europe or asia obviously europe west is probably a little bit better option for you all right and then i don't have to do any sort of estimated cost because again it's not asking me for any money it's not asking me for any credit card or anything like that i'm just going to go ahead and i'm going to click configure and that configure button is right behind eric oh yeah i'm sorry uh yeah here let me uh let me move myself aside actually uh one moment get one with that i want to move ah it's gonna be hard to move myself up messed up a bunch of stuff so i'll just keep going um all right so database name now you'll notice over here in the readme we actually tell you all the values to use again if you use different values from a previous workshop don't worry about it we'll we'll point out where you got it it's absolutely fine you're making a new one i highly suggest copy pasting and oh i just noticed we have a typo there that period is in the code block don't copy the period the period's not part of it um but actually can you refresh can you refresh your guitar because i changed the values there okay [Music] and then s they don't matter too much there's only two places today in our code where you would have to change them right so if you use something different it doesn't matter right so okay i'm gonna go ahead and click create database and that should start spinning up now we'll notice here this is kind of grayed out a little bit um our database is being spun up i can actually go click on it and i will see here it's pending you see it pending all right it's not quite that's fine that's totally fine we're just gonna leave it there it's gonna do its thing and i'm gonna go back to the readme and i believe that puts us all the way down at stepped yes 1d which is your database and connect now again ours is pending it shouldn't take more than a minute or two um yeah so pending should take more than a minute or two yeah are you active already i no it's still pending so if you're getting too active um in our audience just give us some thumbs up so that we know they're fine and would like to know how many people are actually coding along it would be great if you get you know anybody yes all right so what we're gonna do then oh there we go perfect mine is now active you see that status right there it says i'm active which is perfect that's exactly what we want now again following the readme we're going to go down and we're going to connect to the cqlsh console so how i do that is just this right up at the top i'm going to click on that and it's going to bring up an in browser terminal window essentially give it a moment here oh no we don't have to put the password in yeah that's a brand new i think that was this morning that's a change as of today oh so nice compared to having to actually type your stuff again um yeah you can ignore the type your username password that's a holdover from yesterday all right so now in our database we are going to uh type this use spacecraft this command is just like you'd expect from any other database this basically sets a context and you'll notice our prompt there says now we're in the spacecraft if we didn't want to set that context we can actually fully qualify all of our commands by using where you say select like for example select from we could say spacecraft dot and then the table name and that would fully qualify everything so we can actually return data back but we're kind of going easy route today um and we're just gonna say use spacecraft and then forget about it it also makes it easier in case you have your own keyspace name and someone else that we can just sort of like you can just copy and paste everything in there so it doesn't need space absolutely okay and and that's ex that's not good let me refresh here second console all right and i'm going to go ahead all right all right use space craft and then i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to just paste that schema that we have in the readme and that's going to go ahead and create a whole bunch of tables for me basically all the tables we discussed when we're going through the slides so if you want to look through them feel free they are there exactly the same way we set them up before all right there we go my schema is created and then if i want to take a look at it i can actually use this describe command so this will show me what actually is in my database and i'll show you a couple things there we got yep all of our tables are there perfect all right now you want to give a minute or two for people to catch up and i'm actually going to show another thing well people are catching up um i'm going to do another describe command this one is really useful um if you are trying to figure out what your table looked like so instead of tables i'm going to type in table and i'm gonna let's do do spacecraft journey catalog and oh there's my keyboard there it goes all right and i can actually see my table structure you can see i've got all of my values all their types i've got my primary key there i can i can look through this and i can see everything that i would need to actually make a modification or work with this table um there is all this other stuff at the end here this is all operational stuff don't worry about that right now um if you were going in and doing like some really really deep level you know leech cassandra tuning um you'd start messing with these things but for now don't touch them don't worry about them they're just there so you can actually tune tables in cassandra but again we shouldn't need to do that today and and 99 of people who use cassandra are never gonna touch them um just generally not needed okay all right so uh setting up our ide is going to be the next part and you know i'm actually going to close my cooking show stuff um go ahead in the uh you want to wait a little bit until everybody has created a couple of questions in the meantime so what the difference is between a time uuid and a timestamp yeah that's an excellent question so a time uuid um it takes the type of a uuid which is this really long unique number it's basically a gigantic integer and it takes that and it combines it with the concept of a timestamp which is you know a time that you can reference and it combines the two into this gigantic unique number with a timestamp i think it's the predicate of the uuid is that is that correct for tina um the predicate is yeah i think it's one of those uh one of those fields in the middle that sort of like um specifies it as a time time uuid as well and then there you have that code that resolves to the time yeah yeah so basically it's combining two types into a single type that gives you both a way to order and sort data but also provides a really really strong uniqueness to your data which in a normal and it's used it's used very heavily in with cassandra so all the uuids and and time uids and we have driver functions that make it easy for you to generate those right so so you can generate them with the driver but you can also generate them the database itself can generate that for you right so with the mr cassandra query language so it's um it's a good concept it because you want unique the identifiable records but it's also a concept that's very well supported by all the tools around it so it's worth sort of highlighting that later when we come to that part in the code absolutely yeah and we can definitely do that for sure are we getting many thumbs up let's have a look then let's see i don't know i don't see that many thumbs up but um just let us know when you're done or also let us know when you're blocked right so that we can see what's um okay i'll give it another minute or so and then i will uh yeah let's give it another minute and then we set up git pod and then from then on it's going to be really coding so another question was in the meantime what the case and the seas meant in this kind of data modeling diagrams so the k's are for the primary keys and the c's were for the clustering columns so together they make up notice the are for the partition key sorry and the c's are for the cluster and columns together they make up this unique key of a row uh so that's uh i hope that explains yeah you can kind of think of it almost like an address on an envelope where you've got um data isn't indexed natively in cassandra it's actually kind of a direct lookup approach so what that that primary key actually is is the address of your data it actually determines what node in this giant distributed cassandra cluster your data lives on and then where within that partition that lives on that node that data is so it's it's basically like an address on an envelope that allows you to not even need to use an index to get your data back okay we're going to go ahead and okay we've got a lot of people saying oh we've got a few people saying db is up perfect so we could probably go for two all right so i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna open git pod um i'm on a mac some command clicking that that opens it in a new tab and we're gonna go ahead and let that load up here get pod for anyone who hasn't used it is essentially just an online ide it's very similar to like vs code i think they're actually using uh the same material ui elements between vs code and and get pod which is technically using feya which is a an open source project so okay so we got a readme there um just like you can see before um the same stuff we were just going through on github which is really really nice i'm going to go ahead and go into the python and just look at i've got all my files here um i've got my python specific readme um which we're going to you definitely want to zoom in right a little bit so people see what you're doing there you're going to zoom in and hopefully that's good i think it's good for me right um okay and just um we we figured out today how to make it with the light theme i think if you launch github by default you will have the dark theme but it's easier for presenting yeah so just in case you wonder why it might look different for you yeah absolutely and okay so what we're going to do now um i'm going to show you just a couple files we're not going to mess with anything yet but we've got our db connection file this is literally where we go and put all those values that we we defined when we created our database we're just going to throw them in here um and that's going to allow us to actually connect along with the secure connect bundle thing which we're gonna mess with in about two seconds or probably a little more than two seconds but then we have all of our operations here so doing things like actually trying to connect to the database um we're gonna do some inserts um we're gonna do uh some more inserts for an update i suppose and we're basically gonna go through all these different crud operations and i'll dig through the files a little bit as we go um depending on how tight we are on time uh i to you know kind of show off some of what's there so okay um that is basically all we're going to do there i'm going to go back to the slides and we'll keep on going all right so now that we have our database we actually have to connect something to it right and i mentioned earlier we're going to use a driver to connect the driver literally is just a thing in our application that speaks the language of cassandra and that language and that cassandra can speak back to you so it allows us to run our cql statements you know select from all that stuff it allows us to submit that out to our astra which is again just cassandra in the cloud self-service you'd be able to set up your driver if you had a local cassandra cluster to do all the same statements everything else would be the same would just be a slightly different connection info in your driver so really really simple really really easy to do all this stuff should translate really well if you use cassandra professionally or if you're just getting into it now okay so drivers there are a ton of different drivers um we're going to focus on two of them today we're going to focus on the node and the python there's also a java driver out there and then there's there's a whole bunch more um a couple of these are end of life i don't know which all of them are i know the ruby one i believe was i think c and c plus plus were end of yeah i don't know about two shots you don't even see the php driver and this php driver is actually yes stop but um there are i mean these are just the datasex drivers then there are also quite a few community drivers that are available but we aim to cover the most popular events so yeah absolutely and there's a lot of words on this page all i want you guys to understand is that they basically take care of all the difficult cassandra things for you and allow you to just write your statements and get your data back that's that's as much as you need to understand here today all right fix that so to install them we're going to use our language specific package manager so in uh node that's of course npm or node package manager um and in python that's of course pip which actually i don't know what pip stands for now that i think about it i've used it hundreds and hundreds of times but i've never never sat down and actually looked that up so um yeah all right python installation something i would guess yeah i'm sure we're probably gonna get corrected in the chat there but you know um yeah yeah so basically we're just gonna go ahead and we're gonna install cassandra driver and don't worry you don't need to do these as i'm doing the slides i'll walk through these with you um as as we're going here okay then we're gonna set up our actual connection so in this particular um case what we're going to do with the node is we're going to create that client we're going to specify basically our different credentials we're using what's called a secure connect bundle which is just a zip file that has a bunch of kind of certificate stuff and configuration stuff in it um we're going to download that and then just a couple minutes here and and set that up but essentially we just set up this client object and then we're going to use that to submit all of our requests we're doing essentially the same thing in python there although you can see there's a little more code that goes into it um still not bad though it's it's all the same stuff these are essentially perfectly equivalent to one another just you know some slight syntactic changes okay important about the session if you open a session you need to close a session when you're done with it the reason for this is that sessions are very expensive objects they actually have a connection pool associated with them they consume a lot of ram if you start opening lots of sessions you can actually very quickly eat up all your ram i've seen that happen many times make sure you're closing sessions you're not using and this is true of any database this is best practice uh if you are using a database and you're opening sessions you need to be closing your sessions when you're done with them in order to do that in node it's client.shutdown in python it's session.shutdown pretty simple all right now we're going to do the next hands-on portion which is go ahead and click on the language of choice in that table of contents so if you want to do the node click on the node if you want to do the python click on the python i'm going to be doing python here today um that's the language i prefer but you know do whatever is best for you and again just syntactic differences between the two all the concepts we're discussing are going to be exactly the same so and if but they're very similar in in case um so you see less difference than with java for example so this is this it makes sense to cover them together absolutely all right so we're going to go through and we're going to actually get the secure connect bundle so how we're going to do that i'm going to go back to my summary tab i'm going to click on connect and i'm going to click on driver now you'll notice that there's also a rest api on a graphql api you can actually submit requests through those apis if you so desired but we're not going to do that today just understand they're there if that's something you're more comfortable with that's something you'd rather use there's documentation there there's the yeah the rest api endpoint for you it's all it's all pretty easy it's all there and you can look into it we're going to go over here to the driver though and we are going to right click on download secure connect bundle and i'm going to save link or copy copy the link i do that every time when i'm doing it myself i know i did this a few times just copy the link and then we are going to actually um i'm going to scroll down here because it's actually going to show me the command i need i should have done this in a different order i'm going to copy this command first and um i'm going to copy up to there and then i'll copy it in two parts to there yeah exactly oh no but now you don't have to have it in your in your clipboard anymore so you have to go back to yes yes i do uh copy link address and again if you guys get stuck on this please stay in chat we are here to help you all right um you're using a car and and you need to wrap your um you need to wrap your link into double quotes right and actually not throw up an error really if you don't do that but you don't get the right thing you need to wrap it into the double quotes and then you want to redirect it so this gets saved to fit in this case whatever it's your choice right if this was success you should see that about 12 kilobytes have been downloaded you know the received size here right it should be about 5 kilobytes and if you have less than that you might want to refresh your astra screen before you copy the link because the link is only available for a short time right the other thing i'm going to point out here is since i'm using python i'm going to change directories into the crud python directory so in linux since this is a linux terminal that's just cd and then crud python if you're using node it's just crud dash node js and that will get you into the right directory and then if you wanted to check and make sure everything was there you can obviously see it on the side panel but i am a command line um uh nut so i'm going to just ls which is going to list out my files and i can see that my creds.zip is in fact there and it should be referenceable for my code now so awesome we did it now we gotta we're gonna go back to the readme and there's two more things we've got to do one of them is install your driver so again on node this would be an npm install on python we're going to do our pip install i'm going to go ahead and run that pip install cassandra driver and that goes out basically to the the pip i think it's pypi package manager i think in python um yeah i always i need a little more educated on that part and how the inner workings of the backend package manager work basically it goes out it grabs the driver um and it goes ahead and installs that so it's then referenceable in our code all right and then the last thing is we have to match in that db connection file we have to match all of these values to what we used so if you had a database previously and you just wanted to use it you're gonna have to go in here and you're gonna have to change these values right here to match whatever you had so if you were in a previous workshop my guess is you probably have something called killer video for the key space and something like kv user kv password for the username and password if you're doing it here today this is brand new um i believe it's the s user s password spacecraft yeah those should all be um current from today so i'll give you guys a moment to get that sorted out um because that's kind of an important little piece none of this really works unless you do it yeah that's that's the that's actually the only change you need to make today to the code but that is really important and actually what is really important is that you get the directory the path of your secure connect bundle right here because otherwise you see a lot of strange errors because you cannot establish the connection yeah okay now the other thing i will show you guys here is a secure a secure connect bundle this path is going to match wherever you stored that so if for example i were to change that curl command and put the secure connect bundle in a different place i would have to change this path right here and you know basically point to that new location just pointing that out everything today should run with defaults no worries as long as you're running your curl command and the code here um exactly as they were in the readme it'll work but just understanding your own apps you don't necessarily have to store the credit.zip in the exact same location you can you can move it where you need to move it okay next we are going to do our so do you want to let us know whether that works i mean um have you got the secure vandal is it is it curled properly into your good part just give us a little bit of feedback in the uh in the chat so we know that you're you're catching up we're going to do i'm going to go ahead i'm going to run the test connection and if you can give us everyone can give us a thumbs up when they run it and it succeeds so python we're gonna call that file right there the example zero two connect to cassandra this is just gonna go ahead and test our connection it starts it says success and then it closes um if that worked you're configured correctly so go ahead and give us a thumbs up as soon as you get there yeah we've got quite a few people who say that done that's so cool that's wonderful all right you're connected there you go all set up properly so that's exercise o2 ex02 is your test it's it's set up and that's exactly the same for node right so if you're doing this exercise with node all the exercises that they really like to like right to have the same name and but you launch them obviously if you install with mpm and you launch this node right so but other than that they're very similar yeah yeah all right so moving on then i believe i am going to leave that here and i'm going to run this through a couple more slides and then we'll get some more hands on oh wow that was a lot wasn't it so what we did well we've got that out of the way so secure it looks like it's just when we download it we got it working should be good to go there all right here's the stuff we've been talking about all day we actually are going to run some crud operations the cool stuff yes all right exciting so what we have here um are simple statements now simple statements are basically a way to just write some cql slam it into the driver driver handles it return some data boom good to go um there are things get much more complex the deeper you want to go with this but a simple statement is the simplest way to execute a command against a cassandra cluster simply put simple statement what those look like are in both the node in the python we take that session um so node we say client in python we're seeing session dot execute then we're literally typing out a statement and then you'll notice that in the node we have a question mark and then the value behind that gets inserted where that question mark is in the python we have that um percent s and then the value gets inserted there so a little syntactic difference yeah that's actually that's worth pointing out that you're doing a string replacement right it's always a string don't use percent i even though you're inserting an integer after that right it's always a string and it's also worth pointing out that this method of doing things is not really injection safe but um you know for for today we're doing some simple statements and i think i think we actually cover prepared statements and things in uh absolutely we'll get into them oh yeah not even a couple slides all right so prepared statements are the right way to do things for a few reasons number one they are what allow you to take a statement and only need to send it once basically minimizing your traffic so that what happens is is that statement gets prepared right prepared statement on the actual nodes themselves within the cluster and it gets an id and both the driver and the nodes understand what that id is and they can communicate by saying hey um run statement with this id with these values instead of having to send that whole you know select star from blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah with blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah you know that huge thing that takes up a bunch of network traffic that you say id values boom do it send me the result so it's kind of an optimization it's very efficient and it's also much much safer when it comes to injection than a simple statement okay so couple things here you notice we have defined our query so we have comp's query select star from and we still have that question mark there in our node and we now in the python notice there is a question mark so don't use that percent s use a question mark to specify this is the value that's going to be replaced when we actually run that statement okay an important little difference it doesn't seem like much but it will trip you up if you just switch from simple statements to prepared statements um other than that this should all be pretty straightforward obviously you're seeing we're running session execute uh we're running prepared which is the statement um you know in in the python there is prepared in the the node it's the query um and then we're sending that value also in the node we're setting that prepare equals true um again everything that's actually functionally happening here is basically the same uh between both languages it's just a little bit of syntactic difference and you know just do it in the language that you're comfortable with and it's totally fine so we'll go ahead and we're actually going to run some of those now now before i actually run the code or maybe after i run the code we'll see um we're actually going to pick through it a little bit i think we have time how are we doing on time we've got yeah yeah we have time for that yeah let's get our hands dirty then let's get into this all right so um you'll notice all of the exercises are ordered it makes it really really simple to follow along um i am going to go ahead and i am going to go back into my get pod here and i'm going to go ahead and click on insert journey and let me scale this down so it's a little easier to read all right so what are we doing here we're importing our connection right from the db connection so that's that's setting everything up so we don't need all that code here we're just that one so now we're good to go we're importing uuid which is a type that we're using right so we've got to insert a type we're setting up a journey id so that we can actually insert the journey id um and then our spacecraft name is defined here so this this file is essentially just inserting a single journey right this isn't a generator or anything this is just let's build out a journey and simulate running a journey right now what we need to do to do that okay and can i just interrupt for a moment um what we're doing here is that we're actually hard coding our uuid so because we will come back to it with every with every next exercise because we're focusing on this particular journey but as you see what we commented out there is that you could also generate your own new id right your own uh specific with which would then have a proper timestamp and everything right so this is um for the purpose of the exercise you would then have to go and change it in every next exercise that's why we hard coded the uuid in here but you can normally you would probably generate your own and yeah it's it's uh a bit of cooking show magic but it does make the thing run smooth today exactly something i knew your idea prepared earlier say yeah all right so here what we're doing is we're defining our connection is the connection we set up earlier we're saying okay output connection session dot execute remember that's how we're executing a simple statement we've got an insert statement here literally insert into we got our table name we've got the different values we're looking for and notice since we're using a simple statement in python in python only if you're in node it's going to be it's going to be different but in python we're using the percent s and then we have all of the values that we're actually inserting right after that in the the uh uh brackets goodness i'm thinking braces there and i couldn't remember the word brackets all right so that's a simple statement simplest you can get really easy i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to run that and then i'm actually going to show you that i can't type and talk it's a really bad skill for a presenter not to have not been able to type in tools all right i'm going to go ahead and run that and then what we're actually going to do all right so success i'm going to go back to my database cql console connection closed let's go ahead and hit connect come on second console boom all right oops i am not typing correctly so i'm gonna go ahead i'm gonna use space craft again because it find us out we took too long you know one of those security features they're good i'm going to type in select star from catalog now generally i wouldn't type this i know there's only one record in there but if it was a big table there were tons and tons of records i could basically cause a full table scan and that's that's really really bad again i kind of a cooking show magic for today i know there's only one record in there because i only inserted one record in there and i just made the database so i'm gonna do something a little not safe and hey look that is exactly the same data that we just inserted and you'll notice here if i go back to there we go if i go back to the statement itself we have all the data there now it's important to note there the nulls uh the start and the end aren't actually there yet because we have not started the journey we'll get to that in a moment where we actually get to start this journey and end this journey and then we'll actually do update commands to populate those fields but for now just notice and you can see we don't have to submit them we didn't we didn't send the values right we only set the spacecraft name journey id and two data columns active and summary so if you don't set it it won't get stored don't ever explicitly insert a null um that's actually a anti-pattern in cassandra it causes some issues uh basically deletes our null inserts are handled as null inserts so if you're inserting nulls you're actually saying hey delete this data hey delete this data don't do it just omit the data if you don't want the data in there and that's totally totally acceptable in the cassandra world okay um see i think we had to go through yep through four as well all right so let's take a look at what we have in example four we have uh simple s there it is prepared update oh we're not on simple statement we're doing a prepared statement okay so this is really really cool um if i go up here and i look at this query this update query uh notice i've got that whole statement typed out again instead of that percentage we're now using the question marks so really really you know it's something that will trip you up you'll do it once and then hopefully you'll never do it again um we're using our question marks there uh we are basically taking that same uuid that we had from before the same spacecraft name we had from before that's where the cooking show magic that we talked about came in that allows us to reference it directly as opposed to generating something random having to look it up and do everything that way so um right so here's our query it's called update query and then notice this prepared update connect session prepare update query what i just did there is i said everyone the driver and all the nodes in the cluster need to understand that this statement is going to be a prepared statement so they're all going to basically cache that statement and have a a consistent id between all of them so that we can do that just send an id and some values to run with that statement and return our data so that's the actual prepare step that makes it a prepared statement next i'm going to go in and i'm going to take connection oops that stuff connection session execute i send my prepared statement which again in this case is just going to be from the driver's perspective an id and i send my values and remember we we defined that those individual places in the statement were where we were going to replace values so we have update excuse me a certain value and then we have our where then we have the other values so that's that's basically what a prepared statement looks like and how to use it pretty simple let's let's actually run it and python so we're actually going to run that there and we've got our nice little print out of ignition success i'm going to go back to my database and remember we had these were both null now one of them is now set to true and we actually have a start timestamp there pretty cool huh so we just performed an update statement so we've done insert we've done update now we get to do uh the remaining uh well i am we did slacks too because i'm running selects here but we're going to do it programmatically we're going to select and we're going to do i believe we do a delete as well yeah first we're going to update our udts and just to do a little bit more interesting so the exercise 5 is actually the most interesting out of all these update exercises it's the longest and it does the most so probably want to explain that a little bit we'll get into that in just a moment because we get to talk about batches badges are a wonderful thing everybody loves how's it going guys give us sort of like are you catching up is it different i can't i can't imagine you find it too difficult so just let us know how it's going if you have run into any issues absolutely okay i'm going to take a brief moment to discuss batches what are they why are they useful and what are they not um first i'll start with what they're not they're not a relational batch they're not an optimization step where you just package up all your queries in a batch and run it as a kind of a job and then you're done and it's super efficient that is not what they are they are simply a way in a denormalized system to keep tables with similar data consistent with one another simplest way i'm going to say it i'm not going to go super deep into it again we've done plenty of content on it in weeks past if you are curious go check that out but understand they are simply there to keep like data across multiple tables consistent so i'm not going to use them as an optimization it will actually cause performance degradation if i do so okay so what is a batch it's basically a set of statements all in a group that's run as essentially a single job uh in standard terms it goes to a single coordinator node and is handled as kind of a single operation made up of multiple operations um in this simplest term do you have a better way to explain that uh in kind of 10 seconds of between no no that's good that's good so what i've done here is i've taken var my batch actually i'm gonna go with python because again i'm i'm more comfortable with python so i've got my batch statement batch equals batch statement batch dot add you notice i have my prepared statement i have a prepared insert location prepared insert speed prepared insert temperature all of those are prepared statements that i i have in advance and i'm calling them from a batch and then i have all my values there so i have my spacecraft name journey id location xyz which again is that udg we'll get in that moment read time all of those things are just sent as part of that prepared statement all those prepared statements are just part of the batch i send that off with the connection session execute and then just throw the name of my batch in there sends it off does the operation pretty simple nothing too complicated so i think what's worth pointing out here is that um this is actually one of the areas where the drivers differ a little bit in terms of behavior so the python driver gives you this object of a batch statement you know it has this object of simple statement object prepared statement and object of batch statement and and then you just add those statements to it right for python and then you execute it versus uh the um the the node driver basically has a method you know called batch which is basically then executing the batches um that we defined basically so it's um it works a little bit different and i thought it was worth pointing that out um because it's one of the questions that you see a lot in community how do i really do badges and in the different languages so this is an area where the drivers can differ yeah absolutely that's an excellent point okay udt's python special bettina would you like to talk to this a little bit i think you're a little yeah it's another area right um it's another area where the where the drivers can differ right and it's also actually also the same for the batches it's not necessarily the only way you can do it so for the purpose of this workshop um we've taken the easiest route here is that um we just create a class for the for the user defined type and then refer we refer to the class and that means we don't have to do anything special in in general it's actually if you read into the driver documentation and i've put a link to that into the github repo i think it just recommended that you register the udts with the cluster instance and there's a couple more steps to go to just to make sure that that you're really aligned and you're in sync with with what the driver knows about the cluster and what the cluster actually knows about the various types that are available so in this case this is the easiest way of doing it and again instead in the case of node this is actually quite a lot easier right where you basically just set up a small javascript object and you just pass it to the query but in this case um for python you have to take that extra step that you define your class right and and then you refer to it when you when you create your query and that's that's all i wanted to say and look into the into the code we're going to look at it into in a moment it's really not that difficult it's just one of those things where we have a difference yeah and if you look into other drivers like um it said that they all have to own ways of dealing with udts yeah excellent okay so moving on then we get to jump right into that exercise the code bettina just talked about so we're going to go ahead and go back to our git pod here and i'm going to open up the file for exercise 5. all right there we go so you'll notice we have this whole udt setup we're actually using a class uh called location to define it so when we when we go through and we're actually inserting you'll notice that it's down here uh i'm getting lost in code here location insert location in line in line 21 i think you're actually actually referring to it in the prepared statement right and then when you're binding it so a little bit here we go down here yes then in the battery it's in line 46 in this case so there we go that's very referring and each of these xyz would be a variable which you see we're actually um kind of pseudo-randomizing the random random int here it's this is a little generator um obviously yeah it was actually a sensor we'd be getting those values back but since we don't actually have a spaceship in orbit we should get a spaceship we should we should watch this yeah look at his face dude but a couple more things about the code here you know obviously we are generating quite a few data points here so you can you can totally modify that i set it to a thousand so because we can later use that when we page to the results um this is one of the last exercises um so but we're basically generating some some readings here um to make a bit more interesting and then we have this little sleep in there so like you know to stagger them every 10 10 milliseconds and um and we are going to insert a thousand records basically for each dimension this is all the same for um location and for pressure speed temperature into the database so we're going to write 4000 records for a journey and then makes it you can if you don't want to wait you know it's going to take 10 seconds to update if you don't want to wait you can obviously set the total too much less yeah but like 150 nothing yeah okay i might not have adjusted the timer on the note side so i think it might take a little bit longer than no tonight but not that much i don't know can't be remember because i'm running it right now and there it is yeah it's going to take longer than 10 seconds but it's running so it's basically inserting a whole bunch of records and we'll as soon as this is done actually you know before this is done we can go and we can go back to our cql and which table we're reinserting into we were inserting into four of them all four all dimensions i'm gonna grab one of those here and i'm gonna select star from oops did that you need to select the key space again yeah exactly uh yeah i need to get into the point um actually i'm going to type in the that's cool yeah yeah exactly you can use autocomplete but you can uh this is when i said earlier we can explicitly define the key space we're using in our commands this is one place where i'm actually doing that and that's just as an example here so wow we've got data we've got a lot of data and that's awesome exactly so basically we're just writing all these rows the data is in fact there um i think i i just proved that and uh yeah there we go okay and it's still writing or yep still going so at the time i ran the command there's like 831 rows in there um completing i was taking nothing in 10 seconds i definitely did yeah okay there we go reading save journey there we go success boom we did it we actually went and traveled now the one other thing i'm going to do here is i am going to go ahead and do a select from oops space auto complete slow all of a sudden don't forget to say what do you want to select yeah i'm gonna i'm just gonna use use uh spacecraft and i'm going to do select star from uh we want journey which is space craft underscore journey catalog all right so everything is there notice we haven't ended our journey yet we've just been traveling so again this value is null as you can point that out for the next step okay so we're gonna go ahead and go through that we talked about all of that all right so we're going to have to now since the journey is over we've got to mark it as complete which is going to be as you might have guessed is it going to be an update statement [Laughter] [Music] the reason i make kind of a joke out of that is in cassandra there's a behavior called upserts where if i were to run an insert statement with all that same all those same values and change the one that i i wanted to update it would actually do what's called an up search which is entirely an okay behavior it's actually an insert that updates and you can also use an update statement that actually inserts and technically a delete statement also inserts a marker on data every operation you do in cassandra is technically speaking deep under the hood it's an insert statement so insert statements are very very powerful tools um we're not gonna we're not gonna play with it too much but i do just wanna point it out um if you're running a bunch of inserts and updates and you start seeing like wait that data changed how did that data change i would check and see if you didn't upsert that is a behavior that that does occur okay so what are we doing here we're taking an update statement we are doing just a simple uh simple statement uh we are selecting again the same uuid that we had from before our cooking show magic uuid um we're selecting that particular journey we're going through and we are doing an update and we are basically setting it to where is it here uh spacecraft name date time now there we go um we're setting our end time to false or sorry our active defaults our end time to the date time now so it's a time stamp it just says whatever now is that's our end time and then we're defining you know spacecraft's name and journey i need to actually reference which particular journey that is okay so i'm gonna go ahead like always i'm going to run that 0 6 this time and it's going to start success and if we go back to our database i'm going to run that exact same command i just ran select star from journey catalog oh look our active changed to false and we now have an ending timestamp so that journey is now complete pretty cool simple update yeah we've landed successfully or maybe we crashed i don't know maybe it ended due to yeah that's my question all right next step here okay so there were a couple of questions in the meantime i think it's like um so one of the questions was um what does uh c-a-a-s stand for right when you log into astra right and it says you're now connected to the cis cluster and um that's just cassandra as a service yeah it's just uh the name of this kind of deployment probably the name of this internal cluster that we are sort of like in there so don't worry too much it's not that important but it means cassandra as a service so that was fun i will point out there if you're running your own cassandra cluster and you're doing everything on your own cassandra cluster this is actually something you would have defined when you set up that cluster so there's actually a field in there in your cassandra yammel where you actually have to type out what you want your cluster to be called and you you'd go ahead and type that since we're managing that all for you and it's all self-service like bettina said that's just the name that we use but um you know if it's your own cluster it could be you know basically anything you choose uh yeah and then there's another person who pointed out that we have actually again forgotten to upload the slides and this this is so my fault i like you i keep making this mistake week after week yeah so we will upload the slides immediately after the workshop you know we keep i keep making changes right until the until the presentation and i keep forgetting uploading them so there will be in the github reaper my apologies uh once we're done with the workshop any other questions here before we move on um i think there were a couple of connection problems for people but mainly because of misspelled passwords i think which is obviously easy to happen right i think um abby has a question about line 45 can be written in line 32 why do we need to get a new batch statement always i don't think that is um correct i think are you referring to the um line 45. so the which code it's the exercise five right and uh the python code let me just have a let's have a quick look at anything um use the batch statement outside of the for loop as opposed to creating a new batch statement every time um oh yeah i just told it no no actually no you could because we want to send a new batch for every for every reading right for every time exactly basically a new instance of the batch because if you think about it if we had one instance for the match and we just kept using that batch dot add um we'd just be growing this batch and resubmitting a ton of queries over and over and over again so we don't we don't want to do that um we just want to submit this one yeah have it use a new that's a good point actually because batch batching uh um cassandra statements is not bad loading right but loading is this is not to be confused right so it's uh so bulk loading if you want to load a lot of data and say if you want to load all of the data for a journey in one go you would want to you would you don't do it with a batch right you want to do it with a bulk loader uh or something like that yeah it would actually be so it's not this is not for bulk loading the batching it really it would cause you some problems if you did it that way and yeah again i said this earlier i'll say it again any other system you have used batches on are it's a different concept they are not the same kind of batches as as what you've used on pretty much any other system in fact i'm not aware of any system that uses batches the way cassandra uses them um batch honestly the batch keyword is kind of unfortunate because there is such a context around it in the database world and what it historically has meant cassandra it has no relation whatsoever to the traditional batch so please don't try to use it like one um it will it will cause some pretty big issues for you over time okay and then we had um we had um just on youtube is a few questions about how do you create a new key space in astra so um you cannot create it through the sql console right so you might want to just know that um so if you try to create it through the cql console you actually don't have any creation permissions this way right and you will get a permission error um but you can create it through the ui right and that's a little add key space button right down here um if you're on the summary page in your database just scroll down you'll see the key spaces you'll see my spacecraft is there and if i wanted to add a key space i could go ahead type a new name in there hit save it would create a new key space and then it would be usable for my code but i'm not going to do that here today it just it's totally something you can do if you you felt like it okay exactly so normally you can do it you know if you have your own cassandra installation and the permissions are correct you can do it to the cqr console but not for that okay anything else let me just quickly check whether anything else um there was a question earlier i'm not sure whether that's still relevant by the table spacecraft journey catalog doesn't have a partition specified it does it wouldn't you wouldn't be able to create a table otherwise so if you're stood on the console um eric you can show the table console i think i'm here okay the table spacecraft journey catalog every table in cassandra has to have a partition key right it's um it's subsidy essential so it would be in there oh i think i know what the question is so the way this shows up and this is kind of a tricky little gotcha if you just have a single parentheses and you have a value comma value it will always default to taking the first thing the first element as the partition key so it does have a partition key and then the second one would always be a clustering column if you want to be explicit about this say you wanted to use a composite partition key or you just really like being explicit in your code which i am a fan of um the you know the more you can define the the fewer mistakes you're going to have then you would do parentheses parentheses uh and then you know your partition key and then close parentheses and then let's check your clustering columns then another closed parenthesis at the end of that so that's kind of yeah it's a tricky little thing a good eye there catching that uh but yes this actually does have a partition key um and it's just an implicit way of representing that in cql yeah good call though that was an excellent catch and then one last thing i think about um how to make the injection safe right um so for example by using prepared statements right because then it's first prepared and you cannot just stick it in there um perhaps you want some additional answers um no prepare statements is the right answer i mean obviously sanitize everything that comes from user input no matter what it is no matter what system you're running that's just best practice sanitize your inputs but yeah prepared statements basically are disallowing you to inject code snippets into your your things it takes a value and and it takes a prepared statement and all it's going to do is apply that value to that statement so there's no there's no opportunity to inject you know like a i don't know select a sneaky select statement or something in there you know one equals one log me and like all of those things injection attack wise don't work when we're doing it that way because everything's defined for you there's no way to break out there's no way to kind of trick it yeah okay and then one last question i think this is an interesting question from youtube is um whether you can actually link your astra instance to your gcp account and see it from your gcp console not when you set it up like this but you can actually launch astra directly from the gcp marketplace as far as i know yeah i believe that's the thing um the there if you want features like that please provide feedback to us we can take that back to the team and if that's something you'd find useful um the more voices that that speak up on things that are useful the more we can help to influence you know as advocates we also get to advocate back to product for our user base so the more info you arm us with and the more the more voices we have um asking for things the more we can go back to a product team and actually advocate for a change so if that's something that matters please let us know okay do some more coding last set of exercises these there are four of them here um we're going to blow through them kind of quick if i'm going too fast please call me out i can slow down i can talk about something if there's any questions let me know all right there isn't actually a lot of slides for those it was movement to look into the code but if anybody wants more info we can provide some additional stuff here yeah so okay so what we're doing here is list journey so it's literally all we're doing it's essentially that same statement i've been running this whole time to show you guys what's in the journeys table and you'll even notice here select star from space excuse me from space craft journey catalog good grief where spacecraft name is so that all the only difference is that we've actually now bound it with a where clause and we are actually taking that name that we've been using throughout this whole process and we are are using that um that's the partition key we're basically just referencing that and saying give me all the journeys that this spacecraft has uh gone on so if we had multiple journeys for example with a whole bunch of different identifiers that euid was different it would actually give us a list of journeys but in this particular case we've only gone on one journey throughout this process it is going to return that one particular record and i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to run that x07 and we will see here down in my console we have our journey we have the id there we have a summary um bring net astronauts to the international space station uh and we can actually go all the way over here and we can see that those values are in fact the values that are stored in my table so again we're not we're not doing any trickery here that's actually what's stored in my database that's actually what i'm returning um pretty simple all right and actually this is pretty boring because we only have one journey so if you enter a lot more journeys you know uh then more interesting um a table right yeah so at the moment i thought why everything only such little data it's only because we only have one journey in there and so we encourage you to get testing with this and try some funky stuff you know and see whether you can actually build it up a little bit absolutely absolutely okay so now yeah we should actually maybe for the next run of this we should make it where we're doing like five or six journeys um within one because yeah we're we're now going to do essentially the same sort of thing here um but we're going to also reference it by clustering column so we're going to read a specific journey so again if i had for example i would just playing this fall on a nice dashboard right i want to click on that journey and i want to i want to see what the info is on that journey um i would submit you know the spacecraft name and the journey id in my query and voila i would get data back so this is actually going to look um the exact same data is going to return python ex 0 h read journey and i'm going to get that exact same data back about two seconds with um kind of it broken up into a nice format and you can see we just literally formatted python print statements with the formatting there but we just broke that data up same data back but i think there's a couple of things to say here right i mean like first of all you have this kind of um you know the return what you get you can actually pass through it by selecting the different uh column name is in development excellent so that's yeah go ahead and excellent point it's a result set is what you're getting back um it's a standard result set object so yeah absolutely you can take you'll notice we got the for statement in there so we had multiple journeys it would list them out in chunks um and then we're just referencing a row and then the column name and since it's a result set it's basically all the column names are referenceable and you can pull data out based on those it's a really easy way to work with data it's actually very similar in feel and function to like a data frame if you've ever worked with those you know python data science people if there's any of you out there i'm sure you've used pandas with python and mess with data frames very very similar concept very very similar feel should feel right at home um all right so yeah uh we're breaking all those out and we're printing them in a nice format but essentially it's the same data we returned from our last query where we just returned a raw little block there um we're just again referencing it by the clustering column so specific journey id the last it would have returned every journey that spacecraft had been on okay next i'm going to go for number nine here all right so what are we doing with number nine we are going to do a select star from spacecraft speed over time so we're actually going to one of the sensor tables and we're selecting a by spacecraft name and journey id so we're getting all of the data back from a specific journey of a specific spacecraft and again and do you think that's a clever move do you think there's a clever move when you have a thousand records well it's probably still okay for yourself yeah it'll be fine it's uh yeah i totally know what you're saying though um we're doing the exact same thing here where we're parsing out roads now this is an interesting one from base from the last weeks we're actually getting multiple rows back so we're actually going to parse out a bunch of different rows whereas the other one we just returned one row and parsed it out into this nice little block um but essentially we're doing the same thing we're parsing out this row with you know all these different values and you can see we've got a print statement again uh we're just printing out row dot speed row dot reading time you know not nothing too complicated here but it's going to give us back a whole bunch of values so let me go ahead and exit 0 9 and that will start printing out here whoa that was quick see it's quick on reading and the reason for that is that we're denormalized we didn't have to do any joins we just went out said that's the data we want return the data we want boom done simple as that and it's giving you the whole partition right so this is all in one partition so it just has to go once the to the to the disk and read it out basically and give you the budget yeah we can see the values there this is how cassandra stores the data where it stores it all together in one big chunk and for that partition it's it's really interesting too if for anyone who's interested in like drive iops and how this stuff actually functions you can return this sort of uh a partition with a single iop it's one of the super super powerful things about cassandra that like a relational database you know minimum you could do on the best of day with a brand new database and it's you know the second tuesday after the winter solstice is going to be like 16 iops and even then that's like a theoretical perfect scenario cassandra just takes one so really really cool um yeah really really cool all right so next let's move on to the very last exercise here now in this particular instance i believe we've got to yeah we got our simple statement with our query which we've defined above now you'll notice the same way we were defining our prepared statements we basically defined a simple statement uh where we actually are setting it to a variable just like you could in any language we're setting it to a variable with our little string replaced there again we're using string not integer not anything else use string there or it won't work and then we're running our query and we're running fetch size oh what's fetch size well in the driver there's a thing called paging and paging is how you get back a chunk of data a subset of the whole data you want returned and what that's going to return to us is the data and then a pointer to the next set of data so what you got here if i can show it here um we got our statement we're submitting we've got our key that we're looking up off of we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna print current rows and then for offset we are going to oh wait no offset uh i put current rows where is it here ah am i just missing it there bettina can you see it that's basically that pointer that i talked about that says basically jump to the next place give me the next set of i think in this case we had fetch size set to 10 records default i believe is set to 2000 from the driver so in this particular case we only have a thousand records the archer paging um with the thousand records of our paycheck i think it's even more i think it's five pounds but i think that's why that's why we had you know that's why i thought it made sense you saw how overwhelming it is when you get a thousand statements at once you know the thousand results and now we're just gonna page them out right and then we store the pointer to that with the paging state that was a question from somebody in slido what the paging state is it's exactly that reminder you know until what point are we paged and then we call the next page you know for starting from that paging state yeah absolutely so we're going to go ahead and we're going to run that here um so we're going to python i'm going to do ex 0 whoops one we're incrementing past nine i'm going to run that here start exercise and that is going to oh that was so fast you can barely see it it returns 10 values now i don't remember if i set this one and i run it again if it's going to actually run through and it should actually return 20. it's prepared it gives you two pages we only set it for two pages in the code right so first it gets page one ten pages and then gives you the paging state and then it resets the offset which is just uh the idx count right and i will point out here that we actually show you what that paging state pointer looks like there that's just printing out the raw you know the paging state object it's not never something you would you would actually do in a real application but it's something to kind of illustrate that yes this is a real thing this is something you can store and something you can pass with the statement so that's what it looks like if anyone here was curious all right with that and as you see in in line 26 we passed the the paging state to the uh execute statement right to the to the driver here so we we passed it so it's an additional option that we're passing with us in the query and we're passing the parameters and we're passing this as a state right so in order to build the second remember earlier when i said we get returned to the result set and the page state that is part of the output so we're just the way we reference that is just output dot page state that was you know where we're referencing rows we're saying where they're output dot current rows so uh it's just another piece of that object essentially if you're thinking about it like the the very python way of thinking about everything in classes um it's just another piece of that class so all right moving on so that was our last exercise oh yeah what's up yeah i just want to know how everybody's been keeping up and whether that worked out and uh it's i think we don't print the paging state out with note i i don't think we did that so we can probably add that but yeah okay so yeah most of these from this point on are just going to be covering what now so what we have here is a a call for you guys to interact with us we want to see what you guys are doing with cassandra we want to promote you guys we want to make you guys awesome if you guys are making something if you have a cool app um and you built it and it's it's something you want to share with people out there contact us let us know let us take a look at it um we are more than willing to help you guys succeed and help you guys make a name for yourself in the community there um it's our pleasure to do so so um please reach out um okay if you have any feedback on anything cassandra astra or or just general you know our community related please provide that to us as well we really really do um live off of feedback from our community so i know please be active please be interacting with us please be providing that there is also here uh let me datastax or sorry community.datastax.com is another great way to get in touch with us we didn't really touch on that one earlier um it's kind of our blog stack overflow thing that we host that we interact on most of the advocates are out there um out there answering questions um so definitely go check it out uh interact with us there there are also uh vouchers uh see i think i have a slide nope i don't have a slide for that there are also oh i forgot to put a slide in there yeah we will give out certification vouchers today yeah and i think our colleagues probably put yeah the form into the into the chat go ahead and click on that that form fill it out um there is a little bit of info that we ask and then you can basically get a certification voucher which will allow you to have an attempt to take the cassandra certification test um it's basically a free attempt at the certification test so yeah you might i want to say something about this because we ask in the world that you give us a github repo with your own efforts we want to see how you use astra right so and we give you an example reaper in there if you find it hard to get going but i've seen some submissions from last week and they look pretty good right so really interesting things that so people have started to make their own app so if you if you want to be bold show us your own connection code show us your um just do something in the repo how you connect to astra and what you're doing with it but do something that's yours copyright all right wonderful well with that i am going to say thank you all for joining uh the fact that you are here and watching us means we get to keep doing it so you're keeping us employed i appreciate that um you're also keeping us doing stuff we love to do and getting uh letting us talk about stuff that i think we're all on this team pretty passionate about so um really do for the bottom of my heart thank you guys for coming uh please come to more of these you know we we have all sorts of topics um i think monday learnings right now we're covering docker how to use docker we've got um some meetup sessions so the cassandra meetups um obviously due to covid we're all kind of shut down because we couldn't meet in person we're trying to bring some of that back in a virtual way um getting some you know speakers from other places just talking about cool things they're doing so come check us out hang out with us come to the discord um we love to interact with you guys all right yeah so next week is a spring so we're gonna do spring reactive and we actually i think is co-hosted with somebody from github yeah so if you have any questions there so that's really recommended yeah and yeah see you again all right thank you so much that was good fun have a great day everyone and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops",
