    "text": "let's go with a cassandra overview right so apache cassandra is a distributed nosql database every single word is very important uh no sql so it's not working the same way as you may as used to with a relational database like oracle my sql postgresql it's not the same and it's distributed so you can install cassandra on the node on the machine single node it's work technically speaking it's feasible and on a single node you can store about one terabyte of data and do about three thousand transactions per second per core this is our abacus number some rules uh but as i told you it's distributed there is really no sense to install cassandra only on the single node is distributed you will have multiple nodes each node each node communicates to each other using a protocol name gossiping and there there is no master so it's not a master slave architectures master less and we can group nodes functionally speaking in something called a data center or a ring i will use probably data center a lot of time during this presentation but be aware that it can also be called a ring so what's the use case with such distributed stuff well first you need more capacity you simply add new nodes and you need more throughput you simply add new nodes so we hide here the green the red and the purple names database you know you can always scratch you can always change a benchmark to say what you want him what you want him to say but what's important here is you can see the progression you know the more nodes you add the more throughput you have and it scale linearly and this is quite the only database you can scale linearly and we do have customers and a user of apache open source out there with hundreds of thousands of nodes okay multiple petabytes online and so first range of use case it's scale linearly so it's not putting a lot of cpu or ram on the single node now here we are more commodity hardware add multiple small nodes uh and you scale horizontally instead of red you can i want to say a word here can you have a slide back so uh guys usually we scale things horizontally so adding new nodes or vertically replacing old nodes with a more powerful node those who did that vertically know how very soon it becomes extremely expensive and as the more data you store the more clients you have you have to go to extreme scale vertically vertical scaling to a very extreme prices and with horizontal scaling you still scale not only your data and through output linearly but also scale your money cloud costs linearly which is also very great when you handle petabytes over the world yep so this is my data center with seven nodes and now let's say i would like to create a table in there single table so force disclosure in cassandra you put tables not no jesus no key value it's a table okay in the table you will specify one column that will be called a partition key it could be multiple columns let's say one and even with let's say 10 records this is how the record will be stored in cassandra cluster okay based on the value of the partition key values are distributing among the node around the data center that mean select star from a table is not a good use case for cassandra don't do it you would like to provide the values in red which is a partition key and then start working on the single node because all the data will lay on the single on the node you are working on so the red column the partition key will be in your where clause okay move forward so uh data is distributed around the cluster but even with this very simple uh sample you can tell that yeah if i choose to to to to say um first letter of this country name could be the part the value could be the partition key yeah that's not good enough because most of the data will be on the same node you will have what we call the data skew and a single node do all the work and this is the reason why uh cassandra has an internal mechanism to distribute evenly the keys around the cluster when you hash the partition key you get a number which is called a token and a hashing function ensure that the token distribution is evenly distributed around your node and a node acts not only at a single node to distribute the tokens but multiple virtual nodes and that way your data is evenly distributing among the node and its node is in charge of a token range so a fraction of the world table cedric yes i want to have a word about why it happens and why do we need that that's not just an crazy idea of some evil genius there's a very serious background behind that so take a look when we think of cassandra we have to think of three things how it was designed why it was designed to be this way to be working this way it's cassandra is designed to be first working with any amount of information you have 10 megabytes of data that's fine but usually don't use cassandra with 10 megabytes you have hundreds megabytes you have hundreds terabytes it's still fine you have petabytes cassandra handles it so any amounts of data point number one point number two which is even more important cassandra is designed to be extremely quick and moreover predictably quick when working with c point one tremendous amounts of data and trust me it's not easy to be very quick when you work with petabytes and third one we will discover in a moment that's about distribution so uh and to close it up then you work with big data you cannot store all your data on a single server it will be or not possible or simply too expensive and you definitely will not be able to make it uh so uh scalable as cassandra does cedric yep thank you for that okay so how does it work well i do have a value to insert into this data center i just come my partition key let's say called data is created a token here my token is 59 and i can contact any of the node remember there is no master i can pick any of the node these nodes say oh i'm in charge of this range of token 59 is not part of my range of token so i will move the correct value to the correct replica node doing that i'm a coordinator node and i will send the value to the replica node but guess what data is distributed but data is also replicated the fact the the [Music] variable to set up the the replication is rf replication factor so here if i said replication factor two now as a range of token is stored in two nodes and when i contact one node to say i would like to store 59 now the coordinator node needs to send the data to two replicas best practice is to go to replication factor three and we will see later why it has to be a odd number so now i can send my data to the free replica so remember data is distributed data is replicated and there is no master what does it mean that means you can lose any of the node from the data center it's not a big deal at all you can lose a node so what will happen if the if one node goes down well i need to insert 59 again this coordinator node will send the data into the two remaining replica and it will store the value for to be able to send the the value when the node come back online so when the node goes back online it will catch up stream the data that he missed this is my mechanism is called intent on deaf and by default is set to two hours you you don't want that to be too long or you will have two data too much data stored locally on the coordinator nodes and it will take quite some time to catch up when the node goes back online and that would give you a lot of pressure in a cpu and run when you do that okay so hey cedric cedric sorry you are speaking like it's something simple and obvious but as a person who maintain it and supported a lot of a database servers in production i want to really to highlight this point usually whatever time of a year whatever time of the day or night mostly night when you have your server on fire you have to wake up and run and take care of this while your production is on fire and your business manager is angry and clients are just whining all the time with this shiny thing with replication factor three with replication factor five or maybe even with multi-data center deployments which is very simple i can wake up to in the nine a.m and see okay i have an issue with my server so i can take care of it of maybe what we had issue and now it's fully recovered because of hinted randoms come on guys that's a piece of art yes second range of use case no data loss you want your service to be always available and don't rely on a master who could fail and you know need to fail over okay in the in the customer cluster you can have one but also multiple data center so you can create a data center in a eme region another one in apac and yet another one in america and you can read and write from anywhere and cassandra will replicate the data for you so that uh let's say the replication factor is three replication factor is three within a data center but you can also say i would like also my data to be available in data center number two or data center number three all all the three each time you read and write you will pick the data center which is the closest to you you know limit latencies as much as we can and that cassandra will replicate the data for you asynchronously even with the bandwidth it's not great it will it will do it when the network come back so this is very useful for geographic global company so this is the reason why let's say that uber apple and all the web giant uses massively and contribute to apache cassandra because those guys do have a global uh user base and when you take uber in paris to take your flight to catch your flight when you land to the other side of the world you want your uh you know account to be up to date and this is how it does this is how uber does it well nowadays sorry man but nowadays it's a pretty bad example because no one you know yeah but i mean it's still good i mean let's pick another sample you know netflix you know yeah yeah i've heard of the netflix and i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure that netflix needed to scale up at the moment to scale out yeah they've reached the new heights and i i've just gotten used today what netflix got the top score of active subscribers of war for the world history well no surprises and netflix one of the biggest cassandra users and moreover cassandra contributors and one point from my side so take a look again for those who know what is master master multi-data center active active deployment those who did that already usually start to cry because with traditional relational databases it's a very painful process and very error prone process cassandra is designed to be multi-data center so that's a very native process to run in multiple data centers all across the world yes and what can be done around the world can also be done technically speaking you can install a data center in on-premise or on any cloud provider public or private to be honest customer is not most marketplace right now some also provide the service as a service so simply create a data center on the cloud provider you like make those data center part of the same cluster and now you do have a single data layer available everywhere okay that's not magic technical people will say what about communication uh from cloud to cloud yeah you still need to open the correct ip port and do some vpc pairing but you don't have to have you don't have to need you don't need a very good bandwidth you know cassandra will work how it can it will replicate when the bandwidth is there so very good use case single technology to have the same data layer available all across the clouds okay um next time i should pick a mentee question for this one yeah definitely okay so in a distributed system there is a famous theorem the caption or mark blue theorem telling that you cannot achieve three things at the same time consistency that means all the nodes have the same data and you know are in sync availability you can lose any of the node it's not a big deal and partition tolerance you lose the network between two nodes and in in a you know master slave architectures as alex told if you lose the network between the master and the slaves then the part of the network with only the slaves will have to elect a new master and when the network goes back yeah you do have to master in the cluster now and you do have what we call the split brains problem so uh famous technology meisterstuding that cpr you know kafka cassandra with everything we told you by default is available you can use any of the node and it's partition tolerance you can lose a network between nodes between data center it's not a big deal you do have the intune number to help you so what about the consistency well by default you cannot you it's not the priority to have the consistency so don't worry be happy okay but by configuration by design you can be as consistent as you want but if you move to consistency yeah you might lose availability because you cannot ever you can have you cannot have everything yep i want uh to add here something so in the uh fantastic world of ponies and unicorns and rainbows it all works perfectly even on the distributed systems and you have consistency availability and partition tolerance tolerance at the same time if you have a ticket to get to this country please send it to me i really need one so everyone who works with the cloud or even with some custom data centers know what everything what can be broken will be broken it's just a question of time network power whatever you have it will be broken at some point then at the time of a failure at the time of a bad network you have to decide availability and partition tolerance or consistency and partition tolerance and the point is first people call cassandra available in partition tolerant i prefer to call it configurably consistent and always partition tolerant but there is a really nice streak to be all the time at the same time and consistent and available and partition tolerant on the consistency levels which we will discuss very soon here we go with some magic yep okay so tunable consistency as you said alex so here it's coming you do have a single data center client comes and wants to store a data so coordinator will replicate the data three times and send the data to the three replica for each request you will define a parameter named the consistent syllable and it will say to the coordinator node how much time do you need to wait until you can consider that the query is successful so here the first sample is cl1 consistency level one you only need to have the acknowledgement of one node and then you can tell the client request is success other node we would have the the mutation the modification later on but at the point where the client gets the acknowledgement maybe only one is up to date most common pattern is chrome you do want the majority of the node and this is why the replication factor is a odd number because it's easier to get a majority here you want only two acknowledgements of a three replica to say that the request is successful if we do if you would have replication factor four then first you lose some space okay because now that is replicated four times but also now you need three acknowledgements to get your request to be successful so it's slower and yeah that's the reason why replication factor three is you know 90 of the time sometimes you can go up to replication factor five because you are maybe on hostile environment you know you can lose multiple node depending on which close cloud you're running don't think you're pointing anybody here okay and you can also set consistency level one and if you look that now you are fully consistent that means when the client gets acknowledged you are sure you can ensure that all replica are up to date but and now if you lose any of the node the request fail so you are not available anymore because you need all the replica to be uh running to make this query successful okay you remember our cap circle when you set consistency level all you move cassandra to fully consistent and fully partition tolerant but not highly available anymore and at the moment you write a query and you have one note not available for any reason you will get an exception like okay i cannot reach desired consistency level it's just not possible one of the notes is not responsive please try again later yes so to comes to this slide which is one of the most important is say if you want your image yet consistency you will try to have consistency level read plus consistency level right bigger than the replication factor so this this is the reason why everybody is doing cohort because here replication factor read is two over three multiplication factor right is two over three so two pus two plus two is four bigger than the replication factor so you're good to go that mean when i write the data and let's say only the two nodes the two replicas on top are updated and for some reason at the very same time i read the same data and i also said co-op and for this one no luck i'll not pick the two on the top but the two on the bottom like that yeah now the coordinator node will have one node updated and one node that is not updated and you know what the last right always win and so you will get back with the latest value uh to your client because every modification is timestamped and this is also one of the reason all the nodes should have the same clock right so here the major comes so technically you are eventually consistent and some of your nodes may get data later than others but for developers it makes no difference because we always get the most up-to-date information always magic yep okay let's move forward so i will go a bit with this use case so now you can just take a screenshot of this slide this is cedric sorry we have two very good questions i would like to answer if you don't mind go first question is how are the coordinator node decided so there are no decisions or votings every node which receives a query will work as a coordinator node so every node keeps the same responsibility and ready to dispatch any kind of request that's the first step second step when uh so a cluster is a complex thing there are really a lot of job under the water you cannot see the main point so um every node is a very smart thing actually every uh driver on your application is also very smart it knows how the data is allocated within the cluster so schema allocation and then you get a query for the partition the coordinator not already knows which one to ask because it knows the schema allocation over the cluster that's the first point and by the way your driver does the same job so as soon as a cassandra driver connects to a cluster it will load data allocation shema and ask the particular node responsible so for this data so we can avoid one more network request cassandra is very well optimized second question is how does the application choose okay um sorry david answered okay how old nodes handle new nodes and token ranges move i see some people of culture here i see some people with production database experience because yes that's a really great question the answer is cassandra cluster handles new nodes and also discarding of old nodes fully automatically so when you add a new node data shuffles to the new node in the full automatically and the lot on other nodes will be decreased some data is moved in complete automated manner and then then you discard an old node and want to move it out it's completely fine data will be handled by other nodes just inform cluster what you are going to drop one of the nodes yep you're good keys tokens are redistribute when you add new nodes something like that and as you said the driver at the client level is very intelligent it's very clever he is what we call token aware so that guys knows on which replica the data will be and so when you insert something the coordinator in practice will be one of the replica so it will write the data immediately on local disk and then ask his friend to do the same and the client do load balancing among the three or x replica depending on the replication factor you put so quickly so good use case for cassandra are you do need scalability high throughput as volume high volume so every read every right and this is why you should you come up with cassandra in internet of things any kind of time series related even streaming log analytics guess what that's a pretty good data step for a machine learning algorithms right everything related to time series and as you do have massive amount of data you can totally train in a model quite with some accuracy and you may not have been to extract everything as a big csv why because in cassandra there are already tables about availability of course you can lose any of the node and that's pretty good to have always on app and provide data all across the world is distributed you saw you show the different pattern globally or in multiple cloud and this is also the reason why we said cloud native because well in the cloud world you are not master of anything bandwidth cpu ram everything is shared multi-tenancy right so having the capability to lose any of the node it's pretty convenient and it's pretty easy with the networks to do hybrid cloud multi-cloud you don't have to copy the data yourself cassandra is doing that for you okay i will go quick with the data with the data model because you saw that in cassandra you do have one or multiple key space which has kind of oracle schema so you can have multiple key space in a cluster in data center and this is at the key space level that will define all my data should be on a single data center multiple data center and each time provide the replication factor then you do have tables and in the tables you do have partition remember partition keys the value of partitions this is how it's distributed data around the cluster but partition is not a primary key partition itself it's not and does not ensure unicity it's like of the group by for your queries in some way so here is a sample if i create a table user by city so city will be the partitions phoenix partition key and here you saw multiple record within a partition and are big best practice to have no two big partition because hey you know that you need to work with phoenix go to the node and if they again have a million rows in the phoenix partition it will still be slow so you have to pick your partition in a way that your queries are efficient and do not have the partition too big and you can type a ton of questions and i do have a full crew of data sucks force credit transfer that's pretty nice pocketing questions sorry guys okay right so i told you that the partition itself is does not ensure unicity of a record but you still need to ensure unicity you still need a primary key so in addition to the partition key you will find clustering column which are the colon on which you need to sort and order the results and also on your unicity and then you have data colon we can totally be empty no problem okay enough talking that's already a lot uh that would be the longer shot where we will speak then it's your turn to work and to do the first exercise which is getting started with apache kasana so if you look at the url we provide you you do have this welcome page and for the very first exercise we will use a tool called data stacks studio which is not book based but dedicated for cassandra so folks already using other notebooks then could have their hands on datastax studio and see how it look likes and then we will move to jupiter for the machine learning path so data stack studio you open it and you will see multiple notebooks available and i ask you to click on getting started with cassandra and here you will get something like that and it's you know it's a standalone notebook you can go there and start reading and start executing and we do have 10 minutes to do it so i will start again let's say at in 10 minutes and move forward yep by this time everyone should have got the email with the link if by any occasion you didn't write to jack fryer to get your link to your instance or yeah that's exactly how link should look like some characters some numbers ml intro datastaxtraining.com and well do the job um so seems like some folks did not get the link so as i told you everything is available on github so you can go to datastax academy account and it's called machine learning workshop online there you will find everything as a docker compose file with you know cassandra jupiter and the studio especially jupiter on the studio which is the two web tools we will use and see that we also provide the notebooks are as a volume so go there and you know docker compose up three lines and you're good to go um if you do not have install docker it's also pretty quick to install uh so three line and you're good to go still uh you would need let's say two to four cpu on your laptop to make that things work remember you start not only cassandra but also spark also jupiter and dataset studio that's quite a lot so four to eight giga gigabyte of ram it's not too much but yeah you will get the link eventually actually um i see what all links were developed delivered for a while already so if you don't have link yet please check your spam folder oh there is a really great question in the youtube chat where can i read more about cassandra architecture so yeah uh cedric you know what to open ladies and gentlemen we prepare it an incredible place for you to be which is the academy.datastox.com it's a set of courses absolutely for free with all the exercises with all the paths and very different content so this workshop today is only three hours and mostly about the machine learning we are starting very soon but if you want to be really cool with cassandra which deserves it and uh that's the place to be for everyone is the academy.datas.com it's free open and available to everyone and that's just great yep so it's yeah you do have multiple theme it's a total book total free and you know what remember we gave free venture today to for you to pass the certification and so to be able to pass the certification you will have to train a little bit and you you do have all the training needed on the academy and so to pass the developer certification you should take ds11201 and 220 and if you want to have the admin you can also pass 210 so both are free you can take both you don't have to get the vulture immediately you simply has to fill the form we gave you on discord and we'll give you the link again and again for you to you know put your name the email address you would lose you will use in academy and yeah work on those mooc when you feel ready send us an email me and jack and we will get you a vulture this venture is available for 30 days passing the creation date so you don't have to take it right now take your time and if you are an issue about the courses you encounter we are also available on community.com it's stack overflow for cassandra okay it's totally free again we can answer any question can be on enterprise version open source version here you go yep there is a message in youtube chat um from uh abdesh kumar um i was reading somewhere with cassandra is based on master slave architecture so what i can say please find this source of information and burden burn it down with fire because of just a complete lie cassandra is completely masterless from the very beginning so there is no chance it's master slave yeah yeah the full gossiping uh protocol we saw in the slide two is peer-to-peer so israeli peer-to-peer and nodes just exchange the discrepancies if some with this gossiping and only copy delta if they are really really bitter p of no master so uh there is one more question kumar uh what will happen if my three nodes down out of ten nodes which had my table data which is having replication factor of three isn't a type of data loss or not availability so take a look people often misunderstand data amount of servers in the cluster or in a single data center with replication factor if you have a 10 servers within the same data center in replication factor free for your data it means what free replicas free servers will store copies replicas of the data we are talking about so what may happen you have for 10 servers three are responsible for a record a and you lost three servers out of this 10. mostly probably well with some chances those three will be not affected because actually you have ten so uh probability to get seven uh one of these seven down is higher oh you switched to naive bayesian already yeah uh i'm answering questions yes and uh if uh you uh when uh when let's talk about the situation when you lose one of the notes and which is a response one of the replica nodes one of the nodes responsible for the record we are talking about what goes when it depends on your consistency level if you go with consistency level quorum you can afford losing one of the nodes and with two you still will have your data fully available to read and to write and if by you are so unlucky to get down exactly where free servers all of them are free not really all of them are free replica servers responsible for this record obviously it's like if you go and shut down your your computer you cannot use it anymore so uh to make data more available what you want to have you want to take you want to have or replication factor higher or to have multi-data center deployment because you can be fully available despite any disasters only when you are multi-data center within the single data center there is always a chance to make your data inavailable just because your data center is down and that happens that happens with aws google compute platform and so on that's the answer yeah but now if you do have only a single data center and you do have the replication factor three and you lose three nodes which all the replica you need then the driver will retry multiple time and it will feel it will eventually reach the timeout and give you the error yes but you know even at the driver level we also retry the query multiple time and do the failover to other data center in there is any okay so during the end of the exercise i just show you uh a slide if you are already a cassandra user we see that we do have some hardcore guys so you might have known that now data stacks since december provide support enterprise support but also services now for oss customer if you're still on 3.x yeah go to datastax luna and you get enterprise support for cassandra you know price is about let's say you know 50 50 bucks per node per month something like that okay and you can quit anytime you want during the pandemic we also we have also announced that we could provide support enterprise support for ss customers for free and this is called car keep can on customers there is a form um just filled keep the find a slot in in the calendly and yeah you will get our solution architect ready to help you fine-tune your cluster if you need to for free and it's only doing pandemic and so we have we have also data stacks astra which is cassandra as a service uh which provide a free tier you can use a github account google account go there register and you are you do have a three note cluster for you for free forever it's a free tier okay it's not me selling now i'm a community guy everything i told you is customer open source and you know it's free and of course that access community but i share my screen already you know that it's stack overflow for cassandra and you know what we answer in our english chinese portuguese french yep okay let's move on okay that's luna and uh i keep the slide here for you to you know to download the slides and be able to follow the exercise later or so to pick any links you would have missed during this workshop this is astra this is the keep calm form you feel to be able to to get this free support uh and yeah and a community you saw it okay so now what about apache spark well cassandra is all about the storage and it's distributed spark is about computation you want to do computation distribute computation and so that fit very well with cassandra cassandra and spark fit very well in in architecture for years and years and years in big data architecture you sometimes often find those two all along and especially to do all that queries yep i would call them best friends because well cassandra is very well designed to store and dispatch data in milliseconds and dispatch any amounts of the data but when it comes to complicated queries analytics and other things that's not the strongest site and then there comes apache spark which is the best guide to handle things like analytics queries and well we will see you soon much more complicated tools to do yes so speaking of that you know spark is about data analytics or lab queries but you will go deep into that with machine learning so i won't go too much into that um but you know spark is not always for real time you can do you know seconds response time query with that okay so apache spark is a framework for distributed computing uh most widely used available in r python java with multiple module so spark is the core and you do have spark r for the r implementation you do have graphics for uh graph kind of data modeling machine learning lib spark ml this is the one you will use today during our workshop ends on spark streaming for real time work especially working with kafka streaming from kafka into cassandra for instance so maybe you have heard about kafka stream kai sql and stuff that's totally something that's doing the same stuff so but spark streaming is of the full language you can do loop you can do test you can do you know any algorithms you would like and it's a bit more advanced than just moving the data okay so the cassandra instance you will work today does have a spark integrated because it's the data stacks enterprise solution it's we are working with the docker image you can use it for free as long as you're not onto production and so we do have spark in the same binary as casama okay and in the data stacks enterprise product node not only we have spark but you we are also extra stuff open source stuff like leucine and solar to do full text search and graph database based on the work from titan db okay so in the datastax enterprise node you do have that in a single binary but that will what will interest us today is spark and cassandra if you do the proper data modeling with kasama you will probably use oltp request reply lowlight and cqueries and if you want to do analytics on cassandra data full scan you know scanning the cluster spark is very good because it will distribute you know divide and conquer map and reduce distribute the computation among the node and because we do have uh two products in the same binary now spark is also kind of token aware that mean spark will be able to spawn the executor close to the partition holding the data you need to work on okay i need to do i don't know count that's very busy okay you spawn the executor on each node doing local count boom reduce and get the global count and you know that worked very well with distribute computation and this is why those two work very well all along you will do that later okay so i won't go too much there but yeah and so to come to that so this is what you will do guys uh but here is the here is the spark uh it's a spark scalar code and you will work with python for disclosure uh exercise will be python but work the same you know create a spark context read tables or ldd or data frame work with them and go back to customer by doing safe to customer okay and as i told you because spark is token aware you can spawn executor on the proper nodes but you can also have a totally dedicated spark cluster with a full you know cpu power because you already have your own spark cluster to do tons of things and yeah of course you can do that with custom open source not only that the stacks have created the open source park driver uh but also uh even in the data sex enterprise stuff we have something called bring your own spark okay come on lock the full the fat jar with everything you need in your existing spark cluster and boom you can start working with cassandra or the enterprise version [Music] all right and how to enable spark using dse yeah that's very complicated just do dsc cassandra dash k also work for the certain graph by the way dash key for analytics dash g for graph and thus dash s for search and that's it so with that you do have cassandra to store data as stable very large amount of data and you do have spark computation framework able to do distributed computation around multiple nodes with an embedded machine learning library and we will work for those two guys to do some nice stuff and we will switch to machine learning so before we go with apache cassandra related machine learning we have to discuss what's the machine learning by itself and if you like i did some years ago went to wikipedia to read about machine learning by itself you find out the old rule wiki is useless then you already know how what is it and how it works you just don't need wiki and if you don't know what is it and how it works it will not help you with all those scientifical uh scientifical phrases so like that's walls of texts without any clear chance to understand it i suggest us to use a much shorter definition machine learning is a science of drawing circles and colorizing them and you know what it still explains nothing but it at least much shorter so already much better instead of answering definition questions i want to speak about how it works so you will define it for yourself machine learning is a way to process raw data using algorithms to make better decisions and that's very simple and basically all the process we will do later today is we will get some data work with it using algorithms and go with the decisions to show how it works then uh one more word about the use case so there are really a lot of use cases uh for the machine learning it's it exists for some time and all the modern companies already using it more or less and like i don't know uber netflix all the other guys of this size definitely using that a lot of institutions scientifical companies and so on the most typical use cases from the applied point of view is uh forecasting forecasting for price for ratings for weather for all the things like that if you want to try to compute what's the estimated price or rating to be for example for something upcoming very often very often use cases in operation aberration detection uh for people to be able to catch a fraud uh incoming fraud on the banking system let's say or an intrusion detection on the security system or find a disease like that's a very uh up to time uh very on time example because well disease uh findings are very important here and then classification classification is also a very big topic uh so for face recognitions for any kind of categorizations including for example spam detection basically one of the first uh usages for for machine learning was spam detection and well spam detection is a very typical case for the categorization answering a very simple question if this email is bomb or not also recommendations navigations and many many many others i hope in some years later you will suggest something very new your new your very own use case so as we speaking about raw data i guess everyone understands what's what raw data is like the locks of people traveling with uber or locks of people buying something on amazon and so on and so forth with algorithms it's more interesting and maybe a bit not obvious so we will talk a lot about algorithms in the future there are really a lot of different algorithms uh on the webinar some months ago some people asked me like how to choose the best algorithm for my use case and well you know it's really not easy to answer with patients there are multiple approaches and basically that's why uh all those companies that's why we need the data scientists those are the people who uh find the best way to fit an algorithm into the situation to process data and make better decisions and that's there is no simple answer i would say okay there are multiple kinds of machine learning today we will speak about two most used and most how to say basic and good to start those are supervised and unsupervised machine learning rule of thumb how to choose is that a supervisor on are some unsupervised when you work with supervisor machine learning it's all the incoming data is already labeled i will explain what it means in a moment and for unsupervised data is not labeled imagine we working with spam detector based on the machine learning of course to build up and train our algorithm to prepare everything we need to say yes probably or no or to set some chance like okay this email is 80 spam we have to we need to have an existing database of normal emails and spam emails to build then predictions using these data what does that mean some people getting emails pushed to a button this is spam this is spam this is not spam despite they still asking for money but it's my uncle that's completely fine uh so it's not a spam for what it looks like unless you put that in the category yeah yeah yeah yeah so when a lot of people mark the same email as a spam we have database what this email has been dispatched to 100 000 times and mark it as a spam out of like 100 times not all the people press the button some people just delete and so on this case we work with label it uh entity this email has been marked as spam before and then using this email we try to predict like next upcoming email which is not labeled if it's spam or not so all the data we process it with algorithm has been labeled by someone for example by people like when we are speaking about emails in but that's not obviously not only about the emails also operation is a fraud we know when uh like we are working at bank and some person some client is calling to the um operator and says like okay there are some money disappeared from my account i didn't do this operation and okay it was a fraud let's take a look at that and then we have a huge collection of different routes so we can work with this database again data is label it and we can say okay this operation is a fraud this email is a spam this subscription was canceled like if you want to try to predict subscriptions those are going to be cancelled soon that's also very good use case to try to stop people uh from unsubscription with some i don't know special actions or offers typical case is a classification or a regression we already have data with some labels on it good side of supervised learning is it's easy to test so we train our algorithm i will show you how it works later and when using some kind of a test data training data so we test data which we hide from algorithm don't give it to algorithm and then the run algorithm of a test data and see okay it works good or it works not really good second kite kind is an unsupervised machine learning so obviously that's a situation when data is not labeled and cannot be easily labeled and it helps us to find some patterns in the data like a typical use case is an animal detection we expect like something is wrong but we can't really say is it wrong or is it okay what's the aberration what's the situation uh very often use it for clustering like you have uh application and multiple people using this application and you want to have understanding like there are uh we have like a lot of users one million of users 100 millions of users but they are different they have different needs like you know i'm using uh youtube and my daughter uses youtube our behavior our uh options are very different we need to use these unsupervised things for to cluster people to group people into different groups for example and also very many uh different approaches that's not like supervised it is better than unsupervised or vice versa no they are just for different purpose so let's now watch how exactly it works learning workflow we discussed already what machine learning is a way to process data with some algorithms to get better decisions and that's the workflow learning workflow of how it usually goes and we will discuss it now very step by step so don't try to read it all at once we will now get through the steps good so it's a scientifical approach so first we have to ask a question and choosing a question choosing a good question choosing a creating a hypothesis it's a half of work let's say based on the situation we have data we have and question we are trying to answer we are choosing an algorithm then we are preparing our data because ray day raw data may be too much or not clean or any way to be prepared to be processed and we split data into different sets so there are multiple approaches like for this one we will split data to three steps to three pieces then base it on the testing set and validate then base it on the validating set we will uh estimate our model how it goes like if our model if our algorithm is good and when based on the testing then everything is good we will put new data which we didn't have like new incoming email which we didn't have when we trained the algorithm apply it and try to predict labels is it if this is this email is spam or not is this person is sick or not and so on so uh speaking deeper first it goes with raw data and preparation for data with features and labels to be it understandable for the algorithm then they split data training set usually like around 60 70 80 percent well it depends on your situation sometimes higher you prepare this set of the data we will use to train algorithm validating set which is hidden from the model in the beginning we will use to tune model like adjust some settings and testing said we will use to estimate model in the end how it does like to use some metrics and to see if it's a good model or we did not really good and um okay so train and validate tune estimate and then deliver a final model which works very quickly because training has been done already and predict labels based on this thing so that's a typical case for the supervised machine learning and now where is the place for cassandra in these workflows first cassandra stores heterogeneous data like imagine you are trying to build um spam detection algorithm model based on the three different emails how how would be the accuracy of this model it's obviously going to be very well not really well so to work with machine learning you need to have a lot of data best place to store a lot of data well one of the best places to store a lot of data is cassandra so it's an um operational database which dispatches and stores everything very quickly and we can gather data from various sources and store it all together with cassandra like a part of a streaming process well there can be different processes as an x yep they're saying that you can you know specify your training set validating set based on different partitions first yep to get your you know stop range uh but maybe it could introduce some you know ba in in the queries so you also try to to to to train your model on multiple partitions of course and it's already tables and it's already formatted for you know to be used as input for most of algorithms already best thing for us here is uh usually there is nearly no need to clean data because cassandra already has a tabular model and integrates with spark really really easily so basically no more uh not so much job for us to prepare the data with our systems it may be very different um yep yes it's uh yeah yeah it's uh that data modeling is all about the normalization so you do have scarce stable very wide uh multiple row multiple columns so a lot of you know columns to to store the data and it fit also well to you know define which criteria could you know have an impact on the vector you're trying to predict uh well as the next step we model building selecting the machine learning algorithm so we choose and prepare a model which use and prepare algorithm to work with this data and working with this model we also can store results in the cassandra in separate tables because in some cases output can be quite significant so we still want to store it very quickly without any delays and finally we can use the fruits of our work to see how was it what we can predict and how we can improve our decisions based on the steps we did before now you cannot control what you can't measure that's a golden rule and a good thing there are a lot of available metrics for machine learning models so you can assess them and decide if this model is good or not let's start it's not obvious you will see it very soon i will show accuracy based on a very well known in data science field a tumor example it's a very good example to show what's the accuracy accuracy is a metric evaluating classification models how many of predictions were done correctly so accuracy is an amount of correct prediction uh divided by total predictions we've done now take a look at the right at the tumor example we have 100 people nine of them have malignant tumor which is very very bad and 91 of them have a benign tumor which is well bad but not so disastrous so we have 100 people all of them are sick some of them like very badly sick and some of them are not so badly sick and that's very important to identify them uh very on time because if they are late some people may die and that's what we want to avoid and we have designed a model which identified one person as a true positive so we were right he was uh he or she was really sick uh one number of false positive so we identified it is a badly sick but we were wrong we identified 90 percent as a true negative so we identified a tumor as a banning in 90 cases which is case which is a very good result out of 91 having it and we did false negative out of 8 so we said what a person has not so bad humor despite it has he she has a very bad humor so when we're calculating the accuracy answer is going to be correct predictions divided by total predictions 91 divided by 100 0.91 so our accuracy is very close to one and one is the absolute maximum we can have based on the accuracy we can say what our model is good do you think if it's good answer is no because take a look we sent back home eight people having very very very bad tumor without proper treatment and now take a look that's a magic we could have better result by literally throwing a coin you throw a coin you see okay sick not sick sick not sick sick not sick 50 persons we would identify more uh seriously sick people just throwing a coin instead of all the algorithms we use it so accuracy is a very special metric sometimes it's good sometimes it's not so good so stay and watch what you are doing there are more metrics to help two more metrics we want to discuss is the precision versus and recall and those are very different precision also known as positive predictive value it counts only true positives out of all true and false positive so for tumor example precision is 0.5 because we identified one true positive out of two positives like take a look before we identify it one true positive one false positive so it makes two and as a result one divided by two will be 0.5 sensitivity also known as a recall recall or sensitivity is the same counts correctly identified positives out of all real positives so recall or sensitivity is an amount of true positives divided by all real positives and for the example we gave recall is one divided by nine so 0.11 and that clearly signs what we have well not so good model what's important for us to understand there is one serious limitation these metrics are contradict each other",
