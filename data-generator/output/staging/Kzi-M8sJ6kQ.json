    "text": "[Music] with mutating traversals we can add or remove vertices edges or properties from the graph itself there is a separate graph api to do this directly and that api is more efficient with dse graph so if you have a lot of mutating to do mutating traversals might not be the kind that you would like but there are some kinds of mutations that you need to do in terms of a traversal you have previously learned that we have five ways to insert data into dse graph mutating traversals are one of those five ways the mutating traversal gives you the ability to add or remove vertices edges or properties into the graph this is kind of like walking around the data to find a set of vertices or edges that you would like to mutate we have four new steps to get these mutations done there is add v that simply adds a vertex and at the time of adding a vertex we can give it a label we have add e that adds an edge now to add an edge we also need to tell the vertices which that edge is connecting so this will create a newly labeled edge but we will also need to use a modulator to say where the edge is coming from and where it is going to there is also the property step that lets us add a new property to a vertex or to an edge finally there is drop and we use drop to remove a vertex an edge or a property dropping a property just removes the key in value from the vertex or edge when you drop an edge it just removes that object from the graph but when you drop a vertex it will also drop all of the incident edges of that vertex so that drop might do a little bit more work than you expect but when we think about property graph structure that extra work when dropping a vertex is necessary to ensure that we have the correct graph structure after a vertex has been removed as we mentioned adding an edge requires that we come from a vertex or go to a vertex the from and two modulators do that when we use the add e-step we want to use that on a vertex or vertices in the traversal we have to then specify where that edge is going to come from or where that edge will go to of course however we use the step from or to to establish the direction of the edge also we can come from or to a labeled step where that labeled step can be one or more vertices and we can also go from or to a new traversal so that we can explicitly specify that traversal that generates the vertices that the edge should go to or come from the step modulators can take two different types of parameters first you can give it a previously defined step label that can be one or more vertices next you can also write a traversal to find or walk to a set of vertices to connect as always for the examples let's remind ourselves of the killer video movie schema we have movies that belong to genres and we have users who rate the movies where users also know each other we have other people in our graph that have acted directed composed or other types of actions with the movie so let's see what we can do to mutate our graph according to this schema let's say that we would like to go to all of the tom hanks movies in our schema compute the average ratings and store those ratings on the movie vertices themselves let's take a look at the code we will first find the tom hanks vertex that is g.v has person name tom hanks from there we will traverse the incoming actor edges that is we are going to take us to all of the movie vertices that have had tom hanks as an actor from there we are going to mutate those vertices by creating a new property from there we are going to mutate those vertices by creating a new property that is the property mutating step that you see on the second line we are going to create a property called average the value of this property is going to be equal to the third line here we have an anonymous traversal and we need a reality check at this point to know where we are in the stream and within the graph schema at this point we're at the movie vertices next we need to traverse to the incoming edges with the rated label and calculate the mean of the rating values on those edges that is the remaining part of the traversal which we see on the second line it computes the average rating for the tom hanks movies at this point the mutation is done we have added the average property to the tom hanks movie vertices the last line is just providing the output that we would like to see it is getting the average property and the title property and omitting those in the list that you see as you see in the results castaway was rated pretty highly about a 7.1 then you have other movies like the da vinci code sleepless in seattle and you've got mail for our next example how about we add a new genre into the graph say a genre for biographies this is a pretty simple mutating traversal we're going to add a vertex called genre and we're going to give it a couple of new properties we're going to give it a new id and then a name which is biography then the value map prints out this information to see the vertex and all of its properties as a map this is just a new way to add a vertex into the graph currently it's an isolate vertex or a disconnected vertex but it is in our graph let's see what we can do with it now bridge of spies is arguably a biopic of attorney james donathan so let's see if we can add an edge from the new biography genre vertex that we have created and let's walk through the code we begin by adding the movie itself so we add a new vertex with the movie label and fill it up with properties we give it a movie id the title bridge of spies it's year duration and country of origin and there we have it then we are going to label this vertex with the as step and give it the label new so that we can refer to it later on in the traversal next we are going to add an edge this edge will have the actor label there is more we could say about this film but we only want to add the actor edge over to the person vertex with the name tom hanks so we add e actor to the tom hanks person vertex then we have the line that says select new this effectively will go back into the traversal to the vertex that we labeled new so going forward after the select new line the stream will see that vertex we will add another edge from that vertex to connect the bridge of spy's movie to the newly created genre vertex biography this is the last two lines of this mutation so we created a movie gave it some properties associated the movie with an actor and associated it with a genre in this previous example we added two edges but we added them explicitly this time we're going to use a traversal to add edges to a collection of vertices we begin again by getting the tom hanks person vertex and we label it tom on the second line we traverse the incoming actor edge this gets us back to all of the movies in which tom hanks has been an actor from there we traverse the outgoing actor edge to get all of the other actors who have acted in movies with tom hanks so this is potentially now a large set of people vertices at the end of the second line then we will put a constraint saying that we don't want these people to be equal to tom essentially what we did was we found tom hanks went to his movies and went back to all of the actors who were also in tom's movies and when we do this of course we could find tom more than once however we don't want him in this set also we don't want any duplicates like in the case of meg ryan who appeared in sleepless in seattle and you've got mail so here we use the hadoop step to remove the multiple versions of the same actor from this set of people now in this line we're going to actually mutate the graph coming into it we have a collection of vertices and we are going to add an edge from all of these vertices with the label nose that edge will be coming from the tom vertex which we labeled in the first line we have now created many edges from all of the actors who have been in movies with tom hanks and we are asserting that they know tom the purpose of the last part of this traversal is just for display at this point in the stream we are on edges but we need to traverse to the people and then look at their names and in the output here we can see that we have found chris noth and in the output here you can see that we have chris noth david allen brooks and mr blake in this next example we are going to play with adding edges and removing them what we're going to do here is that we're going to turn all of the actor edges into acted in edges in the reverse direction in our schema we have movies that have actors which are people people don't have any notion of having acted in a specific movie so for this example we would like to go to the tom hanks movies remove the actor edges and add in acted in edges in the reverse direction we will start again on the first line finding the tom hanks vertex and labeling it as tom we do this so that we are able to use it later on in the traversal next we go back along the incoming actor edges and we label those vertices as movie that will be all of the movies that tom hanks acted in from these movies we are going to add an edge called acted in that comes from tom so the directionality here is opposite of the original direction for the actor edges of our schema the tom vertex has an edge that points to his films and says that tom acted in these films at the end of the third line what we have in the traversal are edges the mutation is complete but it's going to pass those edges on into the next step from those edges we are going to walk to the outgoing vertex which will happen to be the tom person then we will select the incoming actor edges and drop them so essentially the normal actor edges that we have in the schema have been reversed and are now called acted in so let's take a look at some of the results the second traversal on this slide shows that we get to the tom hanks vertex and we want to count how many incoming actor edges there are sure enough there are zero because we removed them in the third traversal we will go to the tom hanks vertex and we will count the outgoing acted in edges and we see 10 which reflects the data set that we have in our sample graph schema so essentially in this example we have removed the actor edges replaced them with acted in edges but now they're in the reverse direction in this next example let's combine a mutating traversal with a declarative traversal we previously covered declarative traversals in another video but let's still take a moment to see what's going on we begin again by finding the tom hanks person vertex then the next two lines are our declarative traversal that's the match step the match step contains two patterns both patterns start off with an anonymous traversal also both patterns contain variables tom m and x in these patterns we are simply declaring the relationships in these patterns we are simply declaring the relationships that these things have but we are not specifically telling the traversers how to find them so tom whatever it is has an incoming actor edge to a thing called m in the second pattern m has an outgoing actor edge to a thing called x now those assertions will match a certain part of our graph and we will later find out what they are now on the next line we are going to say that the x variable cannot be equal to the tom variable and that is an additional constraint where x is not equal to tom if you think about it if you go from tom to the movies he has acted in we are going to say that we don't care about the times that tom has acted in the same movies with tom we only want to know when tom acted in movies with other people so we say that x cannot be equal to tom next we remove the duplicate actors that's when we get to our mutating traversal at the end of d-dupe x we have a collection of vertices from those vertices we will add edges with the nose label those edges will come from the tom vertex and go to the vertices in x and those edges will all go to the set of people identified for our match step earlier on and lastly let's go back to the incoming vertices pick out the names and see which actors that we have we see chris noth david allen brooks and mr blake now this last example was the same as the previous example it just does it in a slightly different way in this example we combined declarative traversals with the mutating traversal i hope these examples have given you some more information on how to add or delete data within your graph so enjoy the next exercise and we'll be right here you",
