    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems welcome to another episode of the distributed data show I'm David Gelardi Technical Evangelist and I'm here today with Jeremy Hannah Vanguard solution engineer and Jim Hatcher who is a senior solutions architect and we're gonna dig into some fraud use cases with graphs so hey guys how you doing Jeremy and then Jim there we go that's you know I could have told you I could here to our audience I could have actually given them instructions maybe to respond or say something there but that was my event so anyway and yeah so you guys are here in front of me remote so we got Jeremy and we've got Jim and all right so with that why don't we go ahead and do this let's you know I'll make guys I am I am a lay person when it comes to you know working like fraud detection and these particular use cases so I want you guys to help me which is gonna help everybody else understand you know what what kind of use cases like what is this landscape look like I think you know fraud use cases in general have a lot of commonalities whether it's insurance fraud or payments fraud or credit fraud and in a sense that there's there's some seminal moment there's some decision point where we're trying to decide is this good or is this bad and you know so they usually involve some some some similar technologies in order to solve that there's usually some some domain some object space around that around that case whether it's you know you're a customer placing an order or you're a person making an insurance claim you know and but yeah so there's some some kind of calculation that goes on to say hey is this did we got a decision to make here does this thing look good or is this thing look bad and there's some knowledge that the business has about and we know what a what a good transaction looks like and does this look like a good transaction or is this have some some deviation from that from that normal thing and so you know it's a it's an interesting interesting problem to solve there's usually some time sensitivity where we need to get a quick answer but we sending a very accurate answer because you know there's a there's a lot on on the line in terms of but you know business value profit loss so if we take if we take an example like a like an example I'm just gonna take one like personally right so I'm my credit card I my debit card things like that and this is just I went assuming one case right and I have some relationship with some Bank or some entity for that card and they are gonna be you know nowadays is pretty normal right that there is fraud protection with that so right now I happen to be in San Francisco I live in Orlando maybe a little sudden I make some purchases and they're like hey wait a minute you don't live here or you know maybe they look at some of the historical data and they I'm sure it's some degree they'll they'll know that I travel here a lot but they see a weird purchase in Texas and it all sudden it Flags something says this that that's the kind of stuff you're referring to there at least that one case yeah absolutely that same thing happened to me the other day I was my daughter was buying a MacBook and so we we got online we're ordering the MacBook and it got flagged by my bank as potential fraud and I had to call the bank and say I know that that's really me making that purchase and you know the reason for that is because the MacBook is a very it's very easy to convert it into cash you know somebody can go steal your credit card and go place an order or a MacBook and then you know if that goes through they get that MacBook they take it down to the pawn shop and that's just like taking money in their pocket but that that's a great example of you know somebody understanding that domain that you know my bank said if you're making a purchase from Apple that's a higher risk transaction and if you're making a purchase from Domino's Pizza you're probably not gonna take that $20 Pizza and turn it into cash you know like it they know that because they they've studied the you know the statistics around their transactions and and and and so they've got models in place that that are making those decisions form in real time and that that brings up an interesting point too I think is like you mentioned earlier the different types of claims for instance and an insurance claims obviously gonna have a different SLA because it's like male involved and faxing and that sort of thing rather than a point-of-sale with somebody with a credit card or online action those require very fast but then also the use of models versus other data so geographies or how long your accounts been open or a threshold of amount of money that a certain transaction is using and then maybe like you said the the if you're buying something from Apple versus buying something from Amazon or something like that they might have a slightly different characteristic to it and so I think all of those things are taken into account in some form to produce a real-time decision and then I think one thing that we don't see sometimes is behind the scenes if something is flagged or if something that you might see a post-mortem of different transactions behind the scenes and they want to be able to visualize certain things of you know was this really fraud or do we need to flag something for review because it's an inconvenience for our customers and security versus convenience question of we want to allow as many transactions that are valid through as possible and be aggressive but not overly aggressive to the point of having false positives yeah I could see that especially if you know if you have it's too overly aggressive right and you're constantly declining every transaction that comes through that might get a little annoying even though you're you're trying to ensure that you're not gonna have any fraud cases so it feels like there's a balance there right there's got to be as you just mentioned security compared to convenience that there is a there's a balance that needs to be achieved and I think part of that spectrum is the business value that that that the business is going to get out of it in other words that you're that insurance company Jeremy's talking about and you pay out some claims that are that are fraudulent you overpay you know a million dollars worth of claims or something that there's a significant impact to your bottom line yeah if your I don't know you know Apple iTunes and you're doing every transactions a 99-cent thing and it's a very different very different picture in terms of business value but or you might be doing so many maintenance and transactions that you know that the volume of it changes changes the the dollar value so and the characteristics certainly change so talking to some insurance companies they have situations where a doctor hasn't been practicing for the last couple of years and yet that person is writing a hundred prescriptions a day for something that you know it is expensive and so that could be a suspicious transaction and you don't have that kind of data with a 99 cent itunes transaction and so the amount of data what's normal what's not normal and how big of a picture you have but I think and tell me if this is going a little too far ahead I think the more information that you can use in order to avert or get the the valid valid fraud cases faster so you might have incoming messages from different authorities about you know common patterns that they're seeing and and you need to react but then also Jim you were telling me the other day that that there was something with relationships that you in your experience in the fraud detection industry and the transaction processing there was something that you were just unable to do previously yeah you know if you're talking about like real-time decisions you think about you know going on to Amazon or something I'm trying to buy this book and you know I hit submit the order and Amazon has to decide you know very quickly is this a fraudulent order or not or you know any type of e-commerce type of transaction like that you know you have the information available to you about that transaction you know the you know who the customer is you know what the payment method is you know what product they're they're making a decision you know that they're trying to buy so you have that immediate you know the details of that transaction and you're often taking that and you're digging into your database you know what else do I know about this customer what else I know about this product what else don't know about this payment method I'm trying to trying to put some additional context around that and you know what it's often it's often a kind of a balancing act between I gotta I gotta make a quick decision but I want to do as much diggin as I can you know so you know a lot of times if you can kind of peel that onion back one layer you get some picture of it but you know my experience is you know if you had time to sit down and thirty thirty minutes to go through this transaction if you could if you could dig into it peel back several layers all of a sudden you start getting a lot more you know context about what's going on you know you can say hey this customer uses the same credit card as this other customer and that customer bought is logged in as the same device as these other 20 accounts why would somebody log on from 20 different accounts and then you know so sometimes when you can go a couple layers deep you know things start popping to the surface that you think Oh some something's not right here you know this this is not a normal scenario yeah I think the tooling and the the kind of the the way that we typically store things is a very flat form and so I think fraud fraudsters kind of advantage of that fraudsters butter fraudsters are they they're the good guys bad guys what are they what is so people who try to execute some sort of fraudulent transaction where the word blackhat they live in the dark web and some nefarious [Laughter] whatever they can and so if they have like mule accounts or or you know some other it levels of indirection that allows them to kind of stay in the shadows and not be found out because a company doesn't know what they don't know and and if the tools that they have primarily are associated with that flat data that single transaction then they're not going to take a step back and see a bigger picture of what out what else is at play that word it reminds me actually of fraud in terms of I heard a story about story about human trafficking where somebody came to an airport and as they were presenting themselves to a country to enter a country they did some investigation something seems kind of off and they did some investigation kind of like some p.i type of investigation it turns out that that person was a human trafficker somebody else on that same flight through some relationship oriented kind of feeling it back a few levels was also a human trafficker and they had two people that were you know being trafficked at that moment and when we we had a conversation with them and it in terms of fraud I mean this is a very kind of egregious form of fraud if you could operationalize that level of investigation into something that was automatic then you could save lives in that case wow that's that's okay that's pretty profound I think fraud can be a bigger a bigger picture than monetary but I think the results are the same finding finding those who want to do bad things and are various various surface levels and I think what we're talking about we're talking around this is that sometimes you have to go a couple of hops out a couple of neighborhoods out if you're thinking about it in terms of if you store your data in a way that can be traversed from one point to another you can start to see relationships being valuable in terms of detecting more types of attacks and sense of fraud so I want to dig into that a little bit so and I also want to summarize things from from what I'm hearing from you guys so it sounds like okay there are there are multiple different use cases for fraud overall obviously right we've got the monetary ones we're talking about we've got like a human trafficking only one I think there are different ways that you can kind of look at the the types of actions of people are performing and kind of character care categorize those as fraud and then you've got detecting the actual people performing the fraud right there's there's this piece here now it feels like with all of those that there there's got to be I would think there's got to be a difference between when you are say processing data in a more near real-time or real-time fashion compared to when you're looking at historical or analytical data and and how that's handled and the the kind of technology that's used for that so I'm curious about like where what was what were we doing before and has there been a change like from a tech standpoint like Howard so there's actually a couple questions I'm totally thrown a couple questions all you guys at the same time right you have one from the real time to like analytical batch part like what are some of the differences there what do we see there and then from a technology standpoint like historically right was there a way that it was being done or is done today and are we seeing any change to any newer types of technologies or anything that's that's like you know in increasing the game kind of making it making our ability to do fraud detection that much better you know I'll take a crack at that one that you know I think historically you seen the use of rules engines and like business could think of the acronym but you know systems like like these workflow systems that say you know tell me what you know about this transaction I'm gonna filter it through a set of rules and those rules really can tell me hey this is good or this is bad and you know then there's there's some some group who's analyzing what's going on and they say oh hey we're getting we were missing this fraud over here so let's that create some new rules and so it's a very kind of manual human type of a thing but but responsive in the sense that it you know somebody says hey I see a fraud pattern going on I'm gonna put a rule in and within an hour so I can get that deployed into our production decision process and it can start shutting that down but but that involves a human detecting what's going on in a human you know trying to define a rule what does that and so I think a big shift over the last ten years is the use of machine learning data science advanced statistics and you know where people say hey let's let's look at our historical transactions now now that enough time has passed where we know whether or not these transactions actually actually were fraud or if they're they weren't fraud we can label them we can go offline with that data you know go through a process of writing machine learning algorithms against that you know we're creating some training data creating some validation data sets and we can build something like a logistic regression model or support vector machine something that knows how to take labelled data and create creative probability from it and so these are those and then we can take those models and we can use those in our decisioning process so that the use of those models I think is becoming more of the norm or or you or you see situations where people are using their rules engine which allows that human touch in in in concert with these you know machine learning algorithms but in some cases it's moving more towards the machine learning algorithms or they're they're kind of running the show and or or you see the same type of thing where people are using machine learning to say how should we segment our data you know should we should we think about these types of transactions in one way but these types of transactions in a different way you know should should should we say all hype high dollar electronics volumes are going to go through this model because that has a different set of interesting factors for fraud where you know I'm gonna speed stores are gonna go through this kind of a fraud model you know that so there's some interesting things you can do just about thinking about how you want to segment your data to even apply models so so I think that that whole statistical learning the machine learning is really kind of it pervades the space now you know and if you've got a way to get some an additional inside edit your data and you can pull that into those models that that's a competitive advantage for you in terms of your business you know and so I think that's that's a big thing I see and so you know the use of graph databases I think it has an interesting role there yeah it's just like to ask you actually like is there a like are we seeing then a tie-in right to the capabilities you get with graph yeah I think they can be used in a couple places when it could be used on this on this analytical side the batch side because you can use algorithms and graph to look at centrality you know to do segmentation around your data so you can use it on that batch end or or you can use it on the real-time end so you know if you if you create a model that that's gonna make decisions about your your transactions you make these these fraud decisions those models have inputs and so the model might get the built and say I need to know as part of my decision process how many times does this customer use this credit card in the last 30 days and so you have to calculate that in real time to feed that into the model but the more complex that your algorithm is you know if it if it says hey I need to look six levels deep to create some of those inputs then graph can be used on the front end to say hey given this credit card you know go query the graph in real time calculate some of the things that the model needs and then and then fill that in and so you can use graph them on the on the front end for that real time case as well and you know that we talk about graph databases have a lot of value around with when the relationships between your data are valuable you know the graph databases are also not an interesting solution to look at and that's certainly the case in fraud that's what I would say about that yes sir are we seeing I would make an assumption then from the graphs database standpoint that because of that focus on the relationships write up data and in that graph databases are really good for representing those relationships I'm gonna make a base assumption that there is from what you just explained right that there is a movement to do are we seeing more and more folks actually using graph databases for these types of capabilities compared to like the straight up rules engines and such or is that a trend sure so I think there's been more interest I think that that people are finding that like some types of organizations depending on the type of transactions they see they can rely less on the geolocation and rely less on the rules and more on the models and and they've been looking at you know ways of differentiating and that's kind of an odd word for that but ways of getting ahead of it because fraud fraudsters are getting more and more sophisticated in their and how they're approaching things and so I think it gives them another tool set in order to [Music] be able to detect some of these things so so yes we have seen it as a company we've seen that we have data sex Enterprise graph which is a stealable graph that can that can ingest a ton of data like a lot of metadata contextual data transaction data and be able to do these traversals in real time so so yeah I think that that it's it's becoming more of a trend that that's that can be useful in in detection of fraud you know you know I think it's interesting that to note that that a lot of the fraudsters are pretty tech savvy and you know just like you know these like financial institutions are monitoring the type of fraud that's going on in their processes the fraudsters are monitoring what's working for them you know so yeah it's like this cat-and-mouse game where you know the fraudsters changed something and then the financial institutions react and then the fraudsters react and and so you know like in fraud in in in anti-fraud you know the anti-fraud stirs the good guys with the white hats you know they they have to rely a lot on lots of layers and their solution you know you can't just say eh you know this this one way of looking at the data that's gonna that's gonna find all the fraud you know cuz as soon as you start to rely on that and the fraudsters adjust you know and so anytime anytime you have you know different data points and you have different ways of kind of drilling in you know it's an advantage and you know lateral organizations it's not just a binary decision and that this is fraud or this is not fraud the second this is clearly fraud this is clearly not fraud but there's just gray area in the middle and for orders or for transactions that happen you know like we're talking you know you know payments payments fraud you know you know ecommerce type of transactions we're not sure if this is fraud or not let's have a human look at it and and a lot of a lot of organizations are using you know visualization and in that type of a setting to say okay let me look at this transaction and you know bi-able being able to use like graph visualization to look at it you know you could say hey let's take a look at this a dis customer and then let's let's look at all everything that's going on that we know about that customer and then you start to expand that expand that you know they they they might look at that and say oh this is definitely fraud now that I can see that and then they can use that as a feedback loop to say okay can you describe to me why that looked like fraud to you and you can say yeah well because because of this little thing here going on and in fact I could write a rule or you know like we could we could you know summarize that in such a way we're good feed feed it back into the model where this won't go to order review anymore this will fall into that you know definitely deny category see you get that feedback loop and I take that a step further to is to say you not only can can detect it in post review like a post-mortem type of situation or exploration of the data but you can also test that hypothesis over the historical data because you have the validation or test set of things that you know are fraud and you know there's the there's the uncertainty of well maybe we haven't detected it before but there's at least some way to test your hypothesis to see that if you if you can have false positives or false you know with how reliable is that going to be or how noisy is that going to be for customers yeah so that's that's really interesting so so it sounds like from what I'm hearing right is you know yes even though there are newer newer technologies like graph databases right well technically not new but you know I'll put that aside for a moment but emerging more emerging and popular technologies like distributed graph databases that that are it sounds like enhancing the capabilities right that we have overall for providing fraud detection I'm hearing though that they're still there are so humans in the loop this isn't just totally back-end machine learning rulz engines and stuff all in the back end all doing this that there are humans in the loop that provide it sounds like a place where maybe things that we can't quite detect with some of those capabilities that they come into play and they can actually feed that data back in like you were the example you were giving Jim where you're talking about someone's who who they can see through the visualization that actually no wait there's something going on here let's feed that back into the system right so there there's still this interplay right between the Machine and and the human part of it you kind of need both still even with the newer technologies yeah I mean obviously having like a call center staffed with people to take to take you know to be looking at orders things like that it that's expensive for some case for some businesses but depending on you know the the train the value of approving a transaction that that might not have gotten approved you know it may be well worth the cost or for some organizations that they might have a situation where they say I've already got a call center staffed taking support calls and that those those same folks when they're not actively taking a call can do order review so I don't have to you know add additional staff necessarily or you know what but what they're often looking for ways to say hey let's take that the the feedback that we get from those those manually staff you know those human touch points and let's try to use that to better the models the better the other things they absolutely not to make those kind of things as much as possible to make their solutions scale well okay okay no that that makes a lot of sense so we you know is we getting close to to wrap up the conversation a little bit here I just want to kind of open it up for you guys are there any other things as far as you know the this particular topic that we're on you know any other items that you guys wanna another use case or anything that you think is important that we should we should talk about before we close out totally put me on the spot it's my fun I get to put you on the spot I guess I I think it's sort of interesting we talked about you know what Kate what use cases are good for graph and sometimes we'll talk about personalization or we talk about customer 360 where we we just want to understand everything there is to know about a customer to me graph is like the perfect use case or excuse me fraud is the perfect use case for our graph because you're often looking at somebody that I don't know anything about and you know can I look at the data and the data surrounding them and look at you know the neighborhood of connected things and try to get a picture of who they are you know like with the customer 360 case that's my customer my known customer they've given me their information and I know all about them this is somebody who's trying to transact with me and I think I know things about them but I'm using graph to find out the things that maybe I don't know about them so it's very alluring to me I think it's an exciting area to work in because you know like you know Jeremy's mentioned you know that you can use this for you know things like you know human trafficking where you know but by making the right decision by doing this investigative work pulling out that you know the details of this transaction you're making significant impact on the world and but but even in a you know a relatively boring situation like payments fraud I mean the the folks these fraudsters we're talking about their their their criminal groups that are acting around the world and I get that case even that kind of a thing you know you're you you're just using tools to make the best decisions possible you know to stop people from breaking the law you know it's it to me that the anti-fraud thing is just it's it's a fun space to work and it's a it's a meaningful place to work and I think you know graph and tools like this make you know just kind of make you that much better at it it's it's it's it's fun to me yeah you know to that and I already I already get into graph I love it I think it's a lot of fun it's a really cool tech the capabilities with it especially coming from years with the relational world where when you're trying you know the idea of being able to traverse the amount of say connected entities like between vertices and stuff that you can do in graph natively and trying to do that kind of same thing in a relational world it's it opens up a whole new thing but like as you're talking about that like I already get excited about this stuff and you just got me more excited because I was like that's cool it's like you know no no honestly that's that's a really neat I think that's a really neat example of a way that you know that this kind of technology can can kind of really help in the in the whole fraud use case scenario and and as you put it the world right and on that right there on the world alright guys well hey thank you thank you so much Jim and Jeremy has been awesome you know and thank you everybody for watching another episode of the distributed Dave show see ya thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show
