minutes but it got the point across I hope well there were longer interviews that happened of course and one of those was with raghavendran Prabhu from Yelp now if you want to have an opinion about something that's really important that you've done the work and he's done a lot of work they've been doing Cassandra and kubernetes for a couple years now and they have a system called pasta which is really kind of interesting and if you have a chance go check it out but part of that conversation that was more about the future of databases - so I wanted to make sure we captured the entire conversation he has some fun insights on how operators should work and I think you'll enjoy this conversation so here's the long-form version hello this is Ragavendra Prabhu from Yelp London office I work here as a senior software engineer and the team I work in is data base and reliability engineering and in our team as the name implies we deal with the databases which include my sequel and Cassandra and so since we are speaking about Cassandra specifically let me go or some of the things that power by croissant ideal so what is Yelp first of all so yelps mission is to connect people with great local businesses and that includes things such as good high quality reviews or features such as Yelp reservations and waitwait listing for restaurants so we're you very you know you can wait for a new restaurant queue virtually and then you also have a you can also access throught of local services such as a Bloomberg and they're also features such as the Crystal code so some of these things power a lot of our traffic to Cassandra in addition to some of the internal traffic for which we use Cassandra first instance is if in or for caching that's a lot Wow and just curious are you I know you have a lot of services going on how's the cove in nineteen situation for you yeah well for Yelp it's changed I'm sure right well yes of course of course nothing stands in isolation I guess but I'm not sure if I can comment on the financial side of things yeah we could skip that yeah I just know that I've been using Yelp a lot to figure out who delivering yeah yeah I believe we have added some features on that front now yeah always good to adapt right that's yeah alright so we'll jump right into the the kubernetes stuff and I'm really I'm again I'm really happy that you're here this is gonna be interesting so we'll start out with just the general question so kubernetes seems to be the choice that people have made you know organizations are made for deploying applications you know the application tier why do you think that is sure I mean if I have to pick some from my head I would say that one is one is first of all I I guess this does not escape anyone but it has a very active and vibrant community containing not just you know from the open-source community but also like lot of the lot and most of the major cloud products Google Microsoft and Amazon so there's a significant accretion towards kubernetes both from the industry you know behemoths as well as the open source community and that's very useful second it's also quite extensible and this is kind of something that applies to people who have like mature infrastructure set ups you know with their own passes like our like us and and the choice of language or is also contributing towards this you know and that also and more importantly one more thing I would like to add here is that it also supports multiple and diverse cases but whether what I mean is it's tough or it has very good support for stateful applications now imagine let's say there was something let's say you picked something else let's say something X instead of kubernetes and while it may have a good support for stateless applications you cannot imagine an organization having two of them right one for stateful and one for stateless so it's always good to have something which supports both state full and stateless applications in a good manner and I think kubernetes fits that bill really well so you know databases have been have been following well databases have been behind in what's happening or kubernetes and it was just not catching up but what you know what was going on with databases say a few years ago and kubernetes was becoming the thing for application sure I mean databases I think or or the peer have become more and more how should I say it become more manageable in a zero configuration kind of way you know which is which is very useful when it comes to deploying on something like kubernetes Cassandra I mean to start with Cassandra itself is quite good in that way because you know it's kind of like asymmetric setup right you know you just add more nodes and it just grows you know I saw a tweet from your CEO today morning which somebody put peanut butter and jelly so that was that was interesting so I mean things like not relying on anything static you know and becoming more amenable to like what I would says fallacies of distributed computing have you heard of that you know oh yes yeah okay so it's which hand out you know does not depend on too many snowflake II kind of configuration you know for men when you're deploying make for good use cases for communities before working at the other PI was also working on percona extra D with cluster at percona where which is the choleric cluster you know just for my something similar because synchronous replication with you know kind of a symmetric setup and over there also I kubernetes and add that this was a way long when when stateful sets were called expect sets and that was that was quite quite interesting as well so I think for databases like Cassandra which you know do a lot of heavy lifting in form of gossiping and dynamic topology of dist clients and stitching and stuff like that there is a very good future for you know for deploying the getting so here and so we great and yeah it's where we're at right now I think there we've gotten to the point where most of the database people who run databases have come to the same conclusion that hey you know what's this is a good idea but now and just like anything else in open source we now have a lot of operators you you work on an operator so that do you think there's a place for a common operator or do you think there will always be multiple operators sure yeah so speaking about the operators for you know databases in particular I presume you mean for legacy anything smaller or for new infrastructure we starting new with or has a has a Cassandra setup which is not tied too deeply into the infrastructure or has any dependencies any well supported operating like the data stacks operator can go a very long way and probably do everything right but for larger and old and more mature setups right like something like I mean just to give ours this is an example infrastructure tends to be quite opinionated and you see why not what I mean is like Cassandra you know like the general non communities Cassandra uses like HM proxy you know and sign apps a lot for how things are discovered and things like that you also have you know multi-region Cassandra set up and and when comes when it comes to cooperate is itself kubernetes is not federated so it is non federated so there is a kubernetes cluster per region but out under cluster is multi region so we have to do some extra stuff like locking and that you know in addition to other things when we are doing so things like that which are which are probably not used anywhere else but are specific to you know so I think for in but at the same time coming back to your question again I think even if there is like even if there are multiple operators if they do share common meeting rocks using it's possible to have multiple operators but at the same time you know keep them you know they don't have to duplicate much of the logic and you know keep something only have the stuff which is specific to the infrastructure in that way so yeah so just a tldr is for anything you know which is which is not which does not have a very opinionated infrastructure or their own platform as a service like we do I think common operators like the data strikes operator will be you know sufficient for them 99 for everything but for you know setup such as ours very we have our own platform as a service which we need to integrate into we make it operate so and I think you you have a unique position here like what do you think of the most important parts of the kid the kubernetes operated for Cassandra what has to be there sure so when I think of the operator when the when I think of the kubernetes operator I usually think of it as like like a proxy for actual human being you know like you know like you know someone in the operations team but you know like abort no but running as a software so in that way if I think about it the first thing that comes to my MA and is safety you know what I mean by that is the like whenever we whenever the nodes underlying nodes they die or you know new nodes join you know the actual Hardware nodes the operator should be able to like handle lifecycle management of the cluster you know and scaling the cluster up and down in a seamless manner you know that I would say that's the first thing that I would that that's like the primary need if and everything starts from there so the next thing is and this is something that mean that's very exciting for us as well which is to scale cluster up and down you know based on load for instance you know because and no load tends to be cyclical based on you know where the Sun is and and also other thing which which is which has been very useful to us is that you know again as it comes this is like a robot right so it should always have a way to should always have a fallback in place you should you know such as decommissioning the node but at the same time if it's it's not sure it should always have a fallback for human operator to step in which means that there should be a way for a human operator to come in when intimated by you know any signal from this operator to pause the you know this operator to pause the kubernetes operator and do things yourself and then you know resume it I think that's very important and that's something we have been able to do that because in pasta where we deploy this operator you can just do pasta stop kubernetes operator do whatever we want and then do faster and you don't operator then reconciles it state and you know proceeds so that's that's something I would consider to be a very useful thing as well because many a time before this is not it is but many a time it has so happened that you know we have some automation and you know the automation is doing something wrong you know like I mean it's doing something but there's no way to stop it and you also have to go and fix it you know so it's always good if or operator you can stop an operator to do something I mean there are things probably things can go you know in a wrong direction and so I think that can that's always useful and the last thing I mean there are more things but one other thing I want to add here is the deployment safety because with the operator in place you'll have your cluster in the continuous integration deployment pipeline right so you need to be able to deploy things safely and in such a way that if something is not good it is not end up deploying to all the other clusters you know most of the organizations will have like a lot of clusters like we have like 1015 festers you know so you don't want like if we are pushing some package obtain it we don't want it to break everything it's you know if it breaks on first one you know so that's that's something which I would consider very vital yeah that's and I love your analogy that an operator is a robot that is perfect yeah and I think that's a great is a really a great way to explain it to people like what is an operator is it know if just think of it as like a robot running or through your data center it needs it needs good input and it needs to be able to it needs access to things to change yeah so let's talk about the future here so a potential future were all Cassander workloads are running on kubernetes and we have it's really that robot is enabled and has a lot of really can do a lot of really cool things efficiently and was safety like you said so what are some of those new use cases that now open up for Cassandra in terms of use cases do you mean like so use gives us with the future of Cassandra running in kubernetes what do you mean like like a new use case it's like right now you're using it for transactional workloads but and I'm sure it's for a lot of mission-critical data but and what what kind of new use cases and you know this is just we're just guessing here like some new use cases that could come if you have an easier to run Cassandra what what else would you use it for hmm okay that's that's an interesting question I mean we have been using it for like pretty much like a lot of the metric stuff for for some caching stuff internally I mean yeah that's that's that's interesting but but in addition to thinking good use cases like some of the things that would be that would change your way of thinking would be like Hubble you think about the environment itself is what I would say like like when when you deploy now instead of thinking about you know like instance types or how many nodes or something you think about instead think about number of CPUs number of how much memory how much disk you need you know so you your questions that you ask that pushes that you frame when you are deploying something can change according to that so you'll think about CPUs memory and disk and also and this is something which is very important to us it also helps us in thinking better in terms of cost you know so what I mean by that is like when you deploy an ec2 it you know you have lot of system processes and you know you have all the then you have the Cassandra running you can you see groups whatnot but but with kubernetes you can reframe your questions in terms of things like how much what is the cost per CPU or how many requests per CPU or what is cost per request you know things like that so if you can better frame that way right you know you can make better cases and into coming to use cases itself you can you can make better a bargain with the management you know when you are introducing something new because now you will have some very concrete numbers on let's say this cluster needs to take thousand requests per second you know you can say how much cost you can attribute to that you know and I think that's going to be very useful from that point of view and yeah I think that's interesting I had not thought about that that aspect as well but yeah if if the operator is the robot and you give the robot a task here's all I need find the cheapest way to do this yes like a bill of materials right you give like a bill of materials and it tries to come up with a very good optimization for how it needs to be ployed I mean we have also been internally discussing this on like verse I mean you always also need a fleet manager right which does like the right bin packing and all stuff like that so if you can optimize on bin packing of these Cassandra pods in the most optimal way you know you'll be able to extract a lot more from from your hardware and I think that's very vital yeah that is a very that is a the most different answer I've heard so far and it's really interesting and it's also the most interesting I think we've heard a lot about machine learning and new pipelines or smaller use cases but I appreciate that point of view and being an operator someone who has to get out there and make this thing work at the lowest cost possible why not let a machine do that yes yes I mean doing all this math of bin packing what's the best way to pack in our head it's not possible or even on paper you know it's like the np-complete problem right right all the knapsack problem it's kind of like the knapsack problem so it's always good to use you know computers for what they're good for that that they can pack things as efficient as possible and and I see there are a lot of these companies doing some some innovative stuff precisely because kubernetes is extensible so a lot of you know a lot of windows can you know do things on how you can best do kubernetes can you in for instance yeah that's that's I mean that's a really good point efficient efficiency built into kubernetes I mean companies can save you money here's let me show you how I will is there anything else I mean things they you want to talk about here I mean we have a few minutes and we could talk about whatever you know those are my five questions and not mean if there are there things that you would want to bring forward or something interesting you want to talk about you know I'm just happy I have you on here so I'm gonna take advantage of it I mean I was thinking like seeing it from the other side well we were talking about kubernetes but from the cassandra' side I was thinking like are there any things that you are planning to add 200 to make it more you know kubernetes or foul the container friendly and things like that and some of the things I have been thinking like I mean while using this things like what so are there any better ways you can for instance like detect memory pressure or things like that and and you snitching to avoid reducing balance like dynamic snitching and stuff like that I mean when those things for introduced nation I'd I guess they were not introduced with containers in mind right so I was thinking are there any things planning since you're the Cassandra guys anything from that point of view well it's interesting you should mention this there's there's a lot of discussion right now especially on the mailing list about should the Cassandra project sponsor an official docker image but you know the the where the discussion is going is docker has because there isn't just one docker image for everything that it usually is a reflection of your infrastructure I mean what's your opinion on that do you think there is a single docker image or what makes a good docker image for Cassandra I mean it's just a package and I guess some some good things right like some some things which you think are good to run Cassandra with right I mean I don't know maybe like Jamie Locke for instance which G which you recommend but you know not necessarily be present in the docker image so maybe things like that you can probably add I guess and in terms of configuration I don't know like if the it depends like what the default configuration that comes with it as a package if it would be good evaluate it for running from inside the container as well or not and also the Java version because Java I think will Java nine or so was having issues now resume jar that's under of for Java 11 right right so I think that's that's that's an important thing as well well you know prior to if you are running Java 8 you're probably seeing some issues which which is not desirable that one of you I think that would be that would be good I feel dr. image but what do you in addition to that sticking like yeah I mean in terms of settings themselves like you know if there is anything like from the failure detection or or or in places where in just to give you an example so when when there is like a memory pressure for a container you know it readily ohms right so like a Java the container ready looms but but if if container is under CPU pressure right there is no oming for CPU right it gets throttle but it's kind of silent there you know it's what is termed as like a grave failure and while you can have some metrics for that but at the same time I think it would be good if a database can can kind of react to that and and see if it can you know rebalance its load or something like that I mean I'm just thinking but I mean this is just I'm just trying to reframe the question from other side which is that while kubernetes is is doing a lot of things while they're doing a lot of stuff for running stateful workload and you know with CSI drivers and I also noticed kubernetes 1.18 has support for Numa for instance which will be very useful for Cassandra and you know and I would be something that would be something I'll be very interested in looking at it's also good to see like to see from the Cassandra point of view and see if there are what can you you know add to make it more you know and more container friendly I mean maybe there are not many things but at the same time it could be good to see from empirical studies and so on yeah yeah yeah there's one there's one thing that might be interesting there you mentioned like you know what what happens whenever the CPU goes to 100% well usually there's some sort of user action that does that and as someone has to run a lot of Cassandra you know that it's difficult sometimes because you don't know what your users are doing you know they could do things they'd like that that's causing more problems on the cluster there's they there's a lot of talk of the data sacks has been working on our project but I think this is something that will show up in the open source ID is guardrails putting boundaries around things and you know it's how many indexes you can add to a table or the types of queries that you could run there already is some guardrails in the system you may have already seen like whenever you use a batch it'll throw an error or warning if there's like a sizing problem that shows up in the user log though or in the system log but guardrails as a concept database that protects itself now right yeah yeah what do you think about that oh yeah that's kind of like where I was going actually yeah and it's good is this something public or is this going to be public the guardrails that you mentioned it is currently in Davis X Enterprise 6.8 and it's like a preview version of it but yeah I think there's enough folks in the open-source community that are also saying yeah we need this in the center as well oh yeah that's precisely what I was kind of hinting at because because I think the opportunities for like I mean rather than opportunities but the K let me put it this way cases this very in those guardrails will be useful will be more now that you're deploying in something like kubernetes especially depending on how much you are you know trying to what's the level of cohabitation of these Cassandra ports with other things you know things like that yeah yeah that's that's that's the thing that goes along with what you're saying it's like the container the container has to also do some things to work well in kubernetes you can't just expect could be a do all the work yeah and yeah I mean I was also like mulling things like I mean I'm not I'm not sure if kubernetes has this now I think it does but in communities when you provide CPUs it's just amount of CPU shares that you need with the completely fair scheduler of Linux right now I will but I was thinking like if what's the best way you can ensure that cassandra is for instance using like just like isolation of the CPUs like you know it does not provide isolation many PC beauties like using CPU sets equivalent of that how that goes because otherwise what happens is what can potentially happen is if you deploy let us say Cassandra for the things maybe on like a system with 72 CPUs right and maybe like this to give like 512 gigs of memory 72 CPUs so there will be a non-uniform access involved and that's where I think kubernetes 1.18 will help but but there are two more things to think about there which is that once things can get scheduled back and forth between the CPUs and the impact on the cash and stuff like that you know so the lot of things I'm not sure I don't think this is something sometimes the database needs to look at but this is more from the deployment side something to think about because you know there's a potential for a lot of thrashing and stuff like that and and and this is more important when it comes to something it goes under rather than like a stateless application because you know databases are where you know you burn a lot of rubber right you lot of CPU memory everything so that's where you start hitting you know all these boundaries I would say and let's the doom the Nuba changes yeah so if we can use something like CPU set task which allows us to you not flush l2 and l3 cache every single time we do a count contacts which it would be great I think the scheduler has has improved leaps and bounds now with respect to Numa and at the same time it would be good to evaluate I mean if sundar for instance we do use new material but when it comes to deploying on like to burn it is like in a container I said I'm not sure if kubernetes specifically looks at things right I mean I don't think it's communities which can do that but it's the Linux containerization logic ensure that the the processes are not bouncing across and you know that that can hurt the performance well that's a cast I think that that speaks to the cost that you're talking about it's not the cost isn't just always in in money it's also cost in resources how many research reason will and eventually turns into a money problem but if I can do with things more efficiently how can i redirect my my databases into a correct area or pack them properly so that the that CPU is being used as best as possible exactly and I think and if you request something many if you use that kind of thinking like how many requests are being served by one CPU right you know that's where I think that path will be used for that calculus you know because that's where you'll see whether you are getting your extracting the most from that CPU are not like that that's interesting as almost makes itself like your toy you're advocating for ingress to be involved in this as well yeah could be like it could be near as ingress is aware of the of the casino knows behind it let's say you're using something like a service mesh it's do you hike and your your requests are going from or going around the cluster is sto having a closer aware sto is that an interesting thing that's not to think about it we don't use this to you I mean we are still I believe in the initial stages of convoy integration and so on but yeah maybe I think that would be that may be good as well yeah well when you when you brought up the request for CPU that's going to this also going to be attached to a partition key which will give you what CPU what partition which which node in the cluster and all that's baked into the request oh right nice okay that's good to know well the the the Java driver is smart enough - no hell I know where this because of the partition key I can hash this and I know we're going to ask it doesn't do it doesn't just do random hops it is more intelligent about it oh wow yeah right is that something that mean is the Python pretty but how is this specifics in geometry every driver should have that yeah okay it's it's a token aware it's a token awareness that's built into the driver itself oh yeah and it so when it connects to the cluster its participating a gossip so it does where all the color what all the nodes are what all the token ranges are and so whenever it makes a request that's denotes which nodes to go directly to oh yeah we do use coconut we're hoping sorry I didn't know you were referring to that actually yeah well I'm saying yeah add the token we're routing into the service mesh oh yeah that would be quite interesting yeah angry there we just brainstorm that that just happened so I'll have to make a G refer the structured management of Cassandra like in particular with the CSI drivers drivers for so we are using the a WCBS driver storage storage driver with the kubernetes until and and even now we are using the internal bar with communities deprecated all these drivers and AW EBS have their own out of three driver now and which provides it's like shorting which we are using in the old driver as well but but something we are experimenting there restore and so on yeah the backup and restore yeah never never goes away it so is it's a it's the always operations problem I'd rather have a robot do that - exactly exactly owner or in some way like something in the container out like you know like a cron job running in the container or something or even something external yes interesting a cron job in a container hmm I like the external idea better yeah something central but yeah hmm that's interesting too why I mean good stuff I mean that's been something of a philosophical debate in between our colleagues about like like if you put something in a sidecar a body make it versus putting it on the host itself you know it has different implications particularly from from the resource usage point of view like if you can run something one per host rather than one per pod you know it's the number of CPUs multiplied by number of cores right so so quickly your cost can go up so that's something to think about there well resource management in general is hopefully what we get out of kubernetes you know like you said like the bin packing algorithms the the replication controllers that kind of thing keep and it's interesting to see that Cassandra can you know what Cassandra could bring to that is it doesn't really need a lot of replication management it just needs to be aware of what's happening from a pod like where am I do I need to replicate we're really if the entire cluster sitting on one physical node you may have problems exactly and I mean those lines I was also thinking like can you make Cassandra more who should have said more understandable about getting evicted you know like can you tell the Cassandra node that you know this node is going away soon like maybe in two or five minutes maybe two minutes do all the things I mean we do like drain and stuff but is there anything more that we could do there you know something that habits like to operate no impact by the way this is now going off we just issued a shutdown yeah and this is more I'm not sure about other deployments but we have been experimenting with deployments on spots late you know for things like we're in we can you know do away with the possible you know loss of one replica you know because when we use multiple multiple of replication factor things like for metrics for instance in all four Zipkin we have been experimenting with hot plate and spot with spot rates what happens is Amazon used your time window of two minutes you know it says oh this note is going about two minutes do whatever you have to do and you know that should be plenty of time especially if you have a snapshot at EBS yeah for us but what I was again trying to like think weather is there anything if it is known events like you had in advance is there anything else that can be done I mean recently we try to decommission like scale down from like I don't know eight notes to four nodes and we usually our operator logic goes in such a way that we do it one at a time like we do one you know we go from eight to seven and we check everything is fine then go from seven to six and and the way Cassandra and redistributes it's did we were just wondering like can we market so that you know can we and we tell the cluster you that we are going from eight to four you know in some way that it does not allow yeah now if you tell it to go from eight to four well if you shut down decommission four nodes at the same time that's what you're gonna do but there's no I think to order that's that's definitely sounds like something more in the operator's world where it's like I'd like to like if I say my Dooku cuddle deploy scale equals four and you know change my scale then the operator should be like I know what to do and go do it in a way that's orderly and does it in a way Cassandra can deal with it fine you know instead of just shutting down for which it would do if it was in genetics you know just turn them off there fix the problem okay and then video you have a cluster with half the data just all set missing so you're gonna be running repairs to that yeah exactly that's a good looks like I mean we as I said we've been going from 8 to 4 we do one at a time because you know we don't want to you know cause some certain changes in capacity for instance or things like that and at the same time we kind of like we have a readiness check you know the whole state full set readiness check and ordered you know things we use so since it's a stateful set it comes from n minus 1 right so the last year or and so on so this is where this all ties back to the safety and the robot kind of thing I mean all of this happens when we are sleeping you know and we don't want to you know I really like things I mean the cluster can scale up or scale down or you know nodes can die in the middle of the night and that's where it all ties back to the safety it should be able to do it in a safe way and in a fully deterministic way so we have a lot of like checks and balances here and there to ensure that you know either the operator doesn't do something if it's not sure I I love that philosophy thanks for joining us and I hope you enjoy the entire conversation as you could tell Raju and I had a really good time talking about Cassandra and kubernetes and I hope we get to do it sometime soon he was supposed to be presenting this talk at accelerate if we were going to do it in person so I'm really happy that we were able to pivot and turn this into an online thing during the Cova 19 crisis and I think having him on Moore is gonna be great for the community because his insights are really good about how to run casino and kubernetes especially in a cloud environment and some of his insights into things like cost savings are really cool and I haven't heard anyone talk about that yet so once again thanks a lot for joining us and we'll see you next time",
