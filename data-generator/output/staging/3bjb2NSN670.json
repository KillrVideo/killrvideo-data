    "text": "a developer relations engineer at data stacks and I'm so excited to talk to you and walk with you today as we build a superior movie search experience with Vector search this is about an hour we have a lot of ground to cover so I'd love to get into it but before that let's um add a little bit of humanity Humanity excuse me to the mix before we dive into AI um just by sharing where we're joining from so my teammate Michelle has done a great job of warming up the chat a little bit um will you drop either an emoji or a name of the city that you're joining from in the chat uh there's about 300 people um registered and it's such an honor to be able to present to all of you um at best let's make this a dialogue and not a modog and and and in keeping it a dialogue I'd love it if you ask questions as I'm going through our discussion today this is for you right data stx's mission is to help make gen accessible to the widest possible variety of developers and so if um if you have questions I'm here to first and foremost answer them and then continue with the discussion all of this will be made available after over email and there's a blog post about it already on the data Stacks blog that goes into some detail if you're interested with that let's get started our title for our stream is building a superior movie search experience with Vector search building a superior that's a big statement right Superior what makes it Superior we'll spend a little bit of time talking about that and then we'll also spend quite a bit of time talking about Vector search and then finally in sort of our third act we'll bring them all together I'm just looking at the chat I see there's someone here from Ghana welcome Bernard um Michelle from Orange County Nicholas from belg from Belgium WL from Switzerland absolutely great to have all of you here okay so let's talk about Superior movie search well to understand what makes movie search Superior we have to establish a status quo and Superior by definition is better than status quo so what is the status quo well let's explore a little bit um by going and browsing the internet so let's take a look at um some websites let's start with IMDb the world's most popular movie database right and if we come to IMDb and it's you know it's Saturday night and I want to watch a movie um but I don't I usually don't know the name of the movie I want to watch and so instead what I'll do is um I will type something that describes the movie I'm interested in watching a movie movies let's say with a strong female lead and I'll hit enter and what I get here are movies titled strong female lead not movies with a strong female lead um similar like movies with superheroes in New York right this is how I want I want to watch movies like this sometimes and what I get is New York of the movies Formula E in New York the so this is the status quo right the status quo is keyword search is search that checks the words I'm typing but doesn't really care about the semantic meaning of it um again if if you if this feels relatable please leave some feedback in the chat cuz I I I would prefer to feel like I'm talking to human beings as opposed to Bots okay so um this is how it let's look at another um example of status quo by checking out Netflix I like Netflix I love Netflix actually I watch oh this is maybe not safe for work let's scroll a bit I watch a lot of Netflix and sometimes same thing I want to search for movies with a strong female lead right and what do I get in Netflix it's case it's actually even worse I just get nothing your search for movies with a strong female lead did not have any matches try different key this is a problem keywords status quo is keyword search Sim I think we'll have the same um superheroes in New York yeah so it just doesn't that's the status quo and this is really important because as Engineers I'm assuming many of you are Engineers if you're not Engineers please say so I'd be very interested to find out what the demographic is but if you're an engineer we ideally dig pride in creating software that is Pleasant for users to use absolutely we often times work for companies and we need to optimize revenue and profit and IB testing and all of this but ultimately the end is Happy users equals happy customers equals customer retention and instead of having a thousand customers who get angry and leave you have a thousand happy customers right so ux really matters and unfortunately with keyword search the ux suffers this is why the title of this live stream is superior movie search because with Vector search on data Stacks technology like Astra and langlow which we'll get into um we can create that we can create a search experience where it's show me movies about superheroes or movies that feature a strong female lead and and you actually get what you want with an emphasis on the criteria you choose meaning if if it's a romantic comedy in Europe you actually get movies that are in Europe not just about Europe not where Europe is a keyword okay so that's that's what makes this experience Superior all right let's talk about Vector search and how it establishes that vectors are lists of numbers okay um if I ask you to think of an example of a list of numbers some would call it a vector what would you think of I think the most common type of vector is um a two-dimensional Vector meaning a list of two numbers so think of it as an array in programming you have an array with two numbers one comma 2 that's a two- dimensional Vector a vector is a list of numbers that each number represents magnitude that is how much and direction that is which way are we going meaning to the right would be a positive number to the left would be a negative number along some axis it could even be up and down along a y- axis and in in any case without mining without going too far into the details a vector is nothing more than a list of numbers in N dimensions a two-dimensional Vector is a list of two numbers and the most common two dimensional Vector in the world is the coordinate system latitude and longitude is is a two-dimensional Vector system okay if we think about threedimensional vectors we have width height and depth any 3D model exists with a three-dimensional Vector because it's just a list of three numbers that convey width height depth and also not just the direction so width or height or depth but how far in that direction right that's what a vector is magnitude and Direction why is this important well there exist specialized machine learning models called embeddings models they take natural language words in English like dog and cat and food and pizza and embed them literally that's that's why they're called embedding walls they embed them in space similarly to this cup here being embedded in space this cup isn't in fact you could say this cup on camera is is embedded if it's towards the top left at 0 comma 0 in terms of left top um vectors in any case an embedding model will take natural language and embed it in what is called high-dimensional space this is space with more than two more than three thousands of Dimensions I cannot visualize that for you because we see the world in three dimensional space some would argue that time is the fourth dimension we just don't have like 1,000 Dimensions that I can show you but that's what they do they take natural language words and embed them in high dimensional space and when they do this words that convey meaning are closer together than words that have different meaning so for example assuming this is a block of space and assuming the the term cat and dog cat and dog would be over here cat would be here dog would be here right um what about the word for camera it would be like over here just different far away and then based on these vectors you can literally just compare numeric distance so you can compare for example if I ask you to compare eight and two with 40 you would say that eight is closer to 40 but it's not as close as like 37 you know so that's what we do so we take text names or descriptions of movies we turn them into lists of numbers vectors and then we compare so when a user types romantic comedies in Europe We compare the distance of that question with the distance to movies that have that in their description so we vectorize the description of movies turn them into list of numbers and then we vectorize the user's query and just check the how close is what the user wants to all of this stuff in our database so that's vectors and that's what Vector search is it's really just Computing the distance between lists of numbers similar to how we can just we just know if we know basic math that 80 is closer to 100 than two right um one thing though is you need a place to store your vectors and that is usually a vector store or a vector database depending on how you call it add data Stacks we make one uh in fact in fact I would I'm a little bit biased but I'd say we make the best one for multiple reasons it's backed by aache Cassandra that's one of them so it can scale pretty significantly and it is never down it's very robust and very secure and I could go on and on but we have a vector database and its primary role is to store those vectors and then search through those vectors given a user's query we look at all of that in in our demo shortly I see a question in the chat how many parameters you will need to define a vector in N Dimension I don't know what the this question means um maybe maybe ask again um because parameters are they're machine learning sort of knobs their weights right so how many weights will they need to define a vector I don't understand that um and I guess the the safest answer is depends on the model one example is um yeah I don't know the number of the number of parameters and dimensions are different I can tell you that machine learning models optimize for um a specific number of Dimensions based on their training but in terms of parameters I don't think this is publicly advertised by most of the proprietary models um batuhan I'm sorry if that's how I that's not how you pronounce your name batuhan how do you offer Vector databases indeed we offer one vector database and that's all you need you need one vector database called Astra we'll look at that together okay so hopefully by now we have an understanding of what makes what Superior movie search we're going for and what a vector search is and what embeddings are okay right the size and the direction no um levent to come back to your question a vector is a list of numbers that compute that conveys excuse me magnitude and direction that that's it those are that's what's it captured by the numbers and you might ask the question how does the word cat have a magnitude in a direction indeed it does in high dimensional space so assuming a thousand Dimensions you could say go this far um at this speed and you'll arrive at cat basically um Okay so we've understood what makes movie search Superior we've understood Vector search let's look at let's make this really practical and build this okay so to do that we're going to use Astra let's take a little bit of a tour on Astra I will share my screen and we'll get into it so for those of you who don't have a data STX account this is Astra um it's a it's a vector database and actually we we do more data Stacks now but um Astra has the possibility to go to databases and create a database so we've actually created a database ahead of time called Superior movie search as you can see right here and we'll click on Superior movie search and now it's completely empty so we can load some data or we can do other things let's go to the data Explorer I'm going to create a collection for those of you who are familiar with relational databases a collection is like a table it's just a logical way to group your records or your data so I'll create a collection I'll call it movies you can see it's a vector enabled collection we just talked about vectors this is important how do you generate your embeddings um this is a great question and there's many different ways we can go about this with Astra you can actually generate embeddings on the Fly we're we're not going to do that we're going to bring our own embeddings but we can integrate with an existing embedding provider like open aai so I'm going to go come here and integrate this with open aai um I can do that by going to settings Integrations and open Ai and what I can do is I can add my API key to another database which is the one we just made which is called Superior movie search now now that I've connected my database to open aai I can go to it and create a collection that uses open AI embeddings so I'll call this movies once again using open Ai and the embeddings model is text three text embedding three large and as you can see it has a predetermined number of Dimensions which is 372 this looks good to me we'll say we'll use dot productd similarity these are small details that you'll have to dial in for your business case for us these are the ones I'm going with I could with cosine they're just similarity metrics and if you hover on the ey you can understand what they're about typically it's just a a function that determines how close is close enough so we'll create the collection and while the collection creates we can start now thinking about our data there are many many many public data sets available on the internet um IMDb offers its own data that you can download it's it's a massive massive it's like orders of multiple gigabytes and frankly we don't have the time to sit and watch a upload as as much as I wish we did and so what we're going to do instead is use a pre-fabricated list so we did get a huge Json list of movies and we're going to take this list and upload it into our collection and by doing this you also understand how to get data into your Astra collections yourself okay so I'm going to share my screen there may be some Infinity mirroring you may see me infinite but we'll see I'll share my entire screen this time and so what we're going to do is we have a little script by the way this is you in the chat say hi um I'm keeping theat that monitored okay so we have Astra our collection is ready and it's time to load some data we have some data here if we open up our project here's where the data is so we have this script we have this big Json file called movies. Json I wonder if I can format it cool so these are just a bunch of movies with IDs titles and poster paths that's that's all okay and we're going to load this huge list of movies into our Astro database so if we come to load movies. okay we just wrote a small python script to do this again you can write this in JavaScript you can write this in Ruby you can write this in Rust you can write this in whatever you want we just chose python because we feel like it okay so what's what's actually happening here well we're reading the file movies. Json and then we get the we get astroy this is the Astra python client from data STX there's also a typescript client if you're into that what we do then is we initialize the client we connect the database and we get the collection movies now these environment variables are going to be different cuz I just created the database let's go and get them and again these will be redacted after the stream please do not steal them this is this is my data stack account okay so what we're going to do is come here back to my dashboard go to my database which is um Superior movie search and so I've got the API endpoint here I'm just going to copy that and load it into an environment variable in EnV right there these are all my secrets again they'll be redacted be be a decent person and then we'll generate an an application token and we'll copy that and also paste it into our. EnV and this time they don't let you see it but when I paste it here you're going to see it anyway cool so we've loaded up our application token and our API in point finally we need we're going to be using the movie DB to get metadata about this movie the movie DB is a really great project that is that has a really great API that's very accessible and so we're going to get the movies details we're going to get its category and we're going to load its data in into astrab okay so the content is just the description and the page is content and we're going to be using unstructured for that so once all of this is ingested we'll be ready to go I'm going to now run the script so I'll CD into scripts and I will python python 311 um load movies. py whoa um is it just python load movies. py the demo effect I've got to install the um we got to install it so we'll pip install our requirements.txt and now we can run it interesting I think it wants python 3.12 this is the thing with python usually is it doesn't really know um which version so we will do load movies. py I might have to go um VM on this let's see pip pip 3.12 install interesting yeah okay let's just do a VN a VN for those of you who aren't familiar with python is a virtual environment that encapsulates a lot of your applications dependencies so we'll try this we'll create a venv and we will Source the VN um path path to VN okay SL activate bin activate right okay cool so now we're in the VN and now we can pip install requirements.txt there it should be working but it's not it's okay you know for situations like this we have stuff ready okay well that's not going to work in some cases it does but we have a backup no worries we have movies already already inside our database so we can I mean not this one we just created the collection but we have a backup database called rag ++ where we actually presented this so if we come to the data Explorer let's assume the ingestion went totally fine and now if we come to movies we have stuff inside our Astro databasing and if there's time at the end of the live stream we'll go back and fix that um but in any case this is what it would look like and this is literally the after effects of running that script so we've got content and the content is the name of the movie and some of it's the page literally the content from the web page on tmbb Okay so we've got a bunch of this we can already start checking how this works and we can do that by typing here let's search for movies about superheroes apply and so now it's going to convert my string of text into an embedding using open aai as we saw and it's showing me that the most similar thing has about a 75% confidence rate and that the third similar most similar thing is close to the first most so we have some good results let's see what the results are so I hit that and you can see here that the content is The Avengers Captain America Justice League this is so cool let's try let's try another query um movies with a strong female lead Wonder Woman the 355 Kate ladybird Perfect movie Let's what was the other one I said romantic comedies in Europe whoops we should really fix that if if you had enter it opens a new line instead of submits the form that's a little bit of a Mula on our side okay so romantic comedies in Europe Notting Hill below her mouth through my window a romantic comedy centered on Dexter okay so these look like they're in Europe um this looks great so we it's already working but we're missing something really important we're missing a way to actually use this in an application and create that Superior experience we talked about but from a data engineering perspective this is the is the way hey thank you by the way for everyone in the chat um suggesting VM is the better way to do this and stuff I I I would love to now I'm nerd sniped you know I'd love to spend honestly the rest of the stream debugging that I'm not going to do it um but yes we'll we'll come back to it I will either I'll come back to it in the middle of the stream or I will um solve it after the stream in any case we have our database full of movies they're being vectorized on the Fly how you might be wondering how the text is being vectorized let me show you that again I'm going to share screen and by the way if anyone has motion sickness I apologize we'll be bouncing in and out of screen share a lot here okay so let's share my entire screen and come back to this how is it actually that the webpage content is becoming vectors well the unstructured URL loader is going to look at the movie page for the specific ID from our Json file like this and then look what's going to happen it's going to get the title it's going to get the category and then doc. page content is literally the entire text content of the page we pass this content once we clean it of course we pass it to a field called dollar vectorize when we inject it into Astra and Astra is smart enough to look at that field dollar vectorize and automatically on the Fly using our open AI integration convert it into a vector embedding absolutely cool so we don't have to do we don't have to talk to open a directly at all this all just happens right using our openai API key that's very very important okay so we have that working how can we use it well let me show you something called Lang flow Lang flow is a perfect complement to Astra for many reasons mainly langlow makes it very approachable to take data and build realtime AI applications um if you've ever heard of rag that stands for retrieval augmented generation it's where you get data usually out of a vector store and give it as context to an llm or large language model to give you a nice meaningful human readable semantically sensible answer okay that's what rag is we're going to do rag to create this movie search experience bogd Dan you're asking if this will be available on demand indeed it will Michelle will send out an email with a follow-up tomorrow okay so let's look at building a rag application with all of this data and to do that we're going to use Lang flow let me share my screen again let's go to um Lang flow so this is Lang flow um it's actually running locally you can self-host langlow it's fully open source and and this is just on look at my address bar 1271 7865 right so it's you can host it locally and own your whole pipeline um we also have a hosted Cloud version of langlow at data Stacks if you want you can use but you don't have to there is no lock in here okay so let's create a new project let's call it um this blank that didn't ask me for a name you know what we'll call it Untitled so what do we want to do well we want to get data out of Astra and give it to an llm a larg language model and help it give us answers so how do we do that well for starters we actually need um an input some type of chat input to give a prompt right and this is where we'll type something like romantic comedies in Europe then from that we need to construct a prompt actually we don't need to yeah we we need to before we do a prompt we need to actually search the database with this so if we go to Vector stores and get Astra okay and look at this it's so cool we're actually building a gen flow um but using just visual stuff so cool okay so with Astra what are we doing our collections called movies we have an application token and an API end point these are going to have to be different so I'm going to use the one from my database that we just made um so let's go back to EnV copy these and just use them here application token what is that um I just copied the endpoint the endpoint doesn't need to be credentialed um because it's an HTTP URL the application token does so you can create a reusable secret but since it's not reuse we're only using one Astro component so this should be fine I'll just paste it in normally you can add a variable if you reuse things okay so our search input is the chat input and so we're going to be searching Astra for that then we need an embedding model so to do that we'll go here and get open AI since we're using open AI in Astra anyway open AI embeddings right here we're using text embedding 3 large and we'll connect this just like that that's it so now it's going to give us search results and we'll need to do something with those results what can we do with those results well if we have um a helper for parsing data we actually get a bunch of data so we'll just take this and this will parse the data into text and we can let's just do a chat output for now and see what we get so if we connect all this up together and try we can go to a playground and SE this is just the same Vector search we were doing in Astra but now with Lang flow right so we'll say um movies about superheroes and so we're going to query Astra and it's going to return a bunch of Astra records um here so this is the text field from Astra literally um as you can see this is not chat GPT this is nothing as this is just the text field from Astra so let's go back when an unexpected enemy emerges so this is the synopsis that we got from unstructured from reading the text content of the website cool but it's not natural language how cool would it be if we put an llm in front of this because I can't be like um which of these is good it's just going to return me movies it can't actually talk to me you see that it's just searching the database what um is 3 plus I don't know whatever and most llms can do this basic math but it just it's never it's just it can only return movies because this is just database search now if we do rag and put an llm in front of this then it gets interesting and we build something closer to a superior experience so let's um let's go models and choose open Ai and again check this out there's ama ama is a way to run a model locally so you can also do that but we'll talk to open AI um before we give the movies to open a ey let's construct a little prompt okay and here's what we're going to do we're going to create a prompt and prompts are cool cuz they can create variables so we'll say given this list given actually the user asked for movies that are described by described by and we'll say um quy these are the movies and we'll say movies return them a list that addresses their query I don't know something like that so we have two variables right we have the query from the user that's this one and we have the movies that will return from Astra okay and now we give this prompt as input to open AI we're going to be using GPD 40 mini the latest cheapest model and this should just go and so let's attach this now to a chat output and go back to the playground I must say I really like Lang flow it is such a great tool okay so playground let's restart this and we'll just ask like what is four plus 8 actually no let's tell me about good historical movies I wonder if Gladiator would come [Music] up you'll notice it's a little bit longer because it's not only doing the database search but it's doing database search and generation here so here's a good list of good historical it's talking to me that's so cool and it's formatted with markdown and it knows the director and so it's nicely structuring um what is 8 + 3 and I could also like this is not just movie search anymore this is some of the emulated reasoning capabilities that we get with llms right so um what is 8+ 3 which equals 11 here are movies about what is 8+ 3 what um and so this is so cool all right um tremendous so we have this but we've built just another chatbot and honestly I don't know how useful this is um I think it's very cool that it can tie like random things to give me movies for example um I had to can I zoom in can I yeah I had to do I have to do a live stream today with 300 people it's fun also nerve wracking and it's going to take this do similarity search for movie descriptions and then give me the perfect movie to watch just based on random data about my day um and it tells you why becoming join former First Lady Michelle Obama that explores her life about how it's relatable because it's nerve-wracking unbelievable unbelievable right um I do feel like I'm in an escape room right now because none of you are engaging with me in the chat oh I just didn't scroll down anyway I'm joking so no anyway um this is already somewhat superior but it's just another chatbot it's just another chat okay there's questions let me take some questions and then let's put a UI in front of this um batuhan is asking is it possible to make multiple columns on cosine similarity one column is for example content of the movie The Other is the aesthetic and we make search in multiple cosine similarity that's a great question um you could do that by taking and vectorizing each one of the those what you would call columns as a single Vector it's the same thing because then it's going to do similarity search for each of those um criteria right and and it's going to search for numerical closeness so this is a case where you actually you could put those columns let's call them um labels into you could put all those labels into one vector and one column and you will achieve the same outcome that you want um Nicholas is asking can we use this in in a similar interface as chat GPT instead of a chat bot see now Nicholas now we're talking this is what we're going to dedicate our next half to is making this better than a chatbot Nicholas you said it so well I believe that um the the chatbot experience is cheap and uninspired I will say that it's maybe controversial but we have so many so many chat Bots um and I think we can do better right and this is where I want to explore our statement our thesis from the beginning which is we want to create valuable things for users and if users are customers then customers because really by creating truly great ux everybody wins we create great products that maybe convert to revenue but also people are just happier um I think of travel booking websites when you go where you go to book flights and they are not pleasant user experience by and large um and and when we experience something truly good we notice right um I think chat Bots are similar so let's see what we can do that's better than a chatbot for Superior movie search in fact I built a UI that doesn't work that's maybe better than a chatbot let's take a look at this as I share my screen share my entire screen again thank you for engaging in the chat by the way yall are really nice people um if you'll be uh if you'll be willing could you drop a thumbs up emoji in the chat um just to continue to be nice okay so um let's now put a nice UI on this I actually built one I'm going to um npm run Dev and I can show you this is using typescript the then and nextjs you can use whatever you want um but if we go to Local Host 3000 check this out there's I call it we call it movies Plus+ at data stacks and it's a cool little search field it's not a chatbot there's the search field um and I can type in things like um movies with a strong female lead or I can just click the suggestion and guess what nothing happens because it doesn't have the functionality yet and together we're going to build that and we're going to use Astra and Lang flow and all of this okay so how can we get started well I'm going to close this first we don't need this anymore I'm going to open the code base here this is our next Js application and it has just UI and nothing more so if we look at this um if we go to page. TSX this is what we have we have main we have a header we have and the header is a flex box so it's side by side and we have a logo and we have a search form and I can change this and it will change look logo hello um and if I save you see it actually it's I'm not cheating you this is like actually the page okay um the search form in turn has a text input right um and I can also m with this I could change this to um I don't know like and it will change um whoa I don't know where that went you can you come back there we go so and suggestions and suggestions are these little things here okay suggestions finally have a suggestion where they use a hook called use movie search that gives you a function search and so when you click on a suggestion ideally you search but nothing happens we can see why nothing happens is because search does literally nothing but we can say alert high and now does something great so let's there's absolutely no AI here let's add AI here in our remaining time together to start with we're going to create a file and we're going to be using the versel AIS SDK full disclosure I used to work at versel I love versel I think they're one of the greatest companies in the entire world and so we're going to use it um because they just create great stuff so we're going to do export const AI if you can see my screen please let me know um if you can't then I will bump the font size okay oh thanks for leaving thumbs up you guys are so so great okay so and girls and non-binary folks um so let's go export const Ai and what we're going to do is we're going to call a function called a create AI we're importing this from AI RC that's from versel AIS SDK we need initial AI state which is an empty array um AI State and UI state are just a bunch of conversations they're just like messages lists of messages okay and finally actions and actions can be whatever we want in this case let's start with the suggestion take let's take the search function and make it do something so we'll get the conversation so far and append it so we'll do um set conversation is use UI State okay and again the conversation is just this UI state so we just get a function called set conversation and then we get the result of we call a function called continue conversation and we'll def none of this exists we're going to find it okay let's make this full screen we'll get continue conversation from use actions again this is not defined because our actions are empty we'll Define an action okay continue conversation okay so now what do we pass continue conversation let's just pass it a piece of text which is our prompt okay um in fact let's lift these up here so we have the result what we can do is we can set conversation to Old conversation let's just say this is any um and we'll spread the old conversation and the result so we expect the result to be a message okay so we'll save this this looks good however continue conversation is undefined so let's go Define it as an action so what do we want well continue conversation it's an async function that gets a prompt look GitHub co-pilot AI already knows this so what do we want want to do well we want to get a result and we'll say it's the result of awaiting stream UI another function from the versal AI SDK okay what does stream UI take it needs a model in this case we're going to use open ai's model we've been using open a this whole time um and we're going to import open from AIS SDK slop so we'll just import openi from AIS SDK slop and we'll call it with we'll call it with the model that we want in this case let's say GPT 40 then we can we we need to pass in some messages but what are our messages we need some way to get our historical messages well we can say history is get mutable AI State okay and what we can do here is just pass in history. getet um I think that's a promise so we'll await uh wait perfect we'll await history doget and we'll pass in the prompt from the user okay and then what we can do is return and we'll say roll is AI content is the results value just like that instead we we'll we'll say display is the results value cool sorted this is great does it work though um let's see so what we're going to do is just try it I guess oh ah I love it so couple things one we forgot to declare that our AI context needs to e needs to execute only in a server environment and use UI state must be wrapped inside an AI provider so let's go to our layout this is like the root of our entire page you can see our HTML document begins here and we'll wrap this thing in AI like that we just where does AI come from again in create AI we wrote this export const AI okay so now let's try um hello is anything going to Happ happen no nothing's going to happen let's try that again what's going on do we have errors we do not have errors I think oh I know why silly me finally we're not actually using the conversation it's just an empty array so we'll say result is use UI State aha there we go there perfect it's totally working so let's try this again hello and hello how can I is you today um who are you yeah kind of cool I mean we built another chat bot but we're getting there we still have some time also this kind of looks pretty nasty um I'll pause here look at questions and come back okay cool there's lots of thumbs ups and no questions I love it let's continue sharing my screen hey I just need to take a moment y'all are so cool thank you for sticking no l don't go um in any case VJ I will raise the font size um let me share my screen again so this is where it gets really good um Le you're missing out man so let's go back to our application this one and okay so it looks good we're getting back text so you know what let's format this text a little bit um let's go to our AI component our continue conversation and if we get back text what we can do is it's a function that returns some stuff so what do text get it gets content it gets done so we can say if done history do update and we can do this we could pass in the old his let's just await history doget ah it's async function Okay so so we can pass in the history and the result right that's kind of what we're doing here its role is assistant not AI okay great this is also assistant here and we return the text so we're just like persisting some conversation history it's content great but we could do better since it's a function that returns something and we're in the web one Golden Rule of the web is a function that returns UI is called a component in react or angular or spelt or whatever you want so we can actually return UI here in fact we can wrap this in markdown which is our markdown component um and immediately things get a lot richer so let's try again hello who are you okay so there's some spacing show me a list of facts I'm just trying to see look at that so there's um bold and our markdown is working this is so great but again I said earlier we're not here to build a chatbot we're here to build a rich movie search experience okay so let's do this again let's say show me romantic comedies in Europe totally working and and the cool thing about this is it it just knows to include um the name of the movie and the location Vienna Austria Siri England Province France Rome Italy so cool but again it's a chatbot how can we make it UI well since we're getting this text we can do a bunch of stuff that is very very interesting here for example um instead of text we could just return a list of movies and so what if we do our Vector search here right what if we um instead of talking to open AI do our Vector search and just get a list of movies so let's try this so um let's say in the event of text do this but let's create a tool tools and this is this is tool so the llm the large language is going to call these functions when we when it feels right based on the functions metadata so we'll say show movies okay and a function can get some parameters so parameters uses Zod which is a schema validation library to describe its parameters we have an object the genre okay or even better let's do criteria how about that it's a string then we have a description which is it this is how you tell the llm when to call this function now llms can call tools similar to how I as a human being can call tools for example if you ask me to multiply 18 prime numbers I'll go like I don't know how to do that and I will go reach for a tool a calculator and I will call it and I will use it llms can do this if you say hey these tools are available so if you can't do something use the tool and return its value so that's what we're going to do here so um use this tool when the user asks to see to be shown movies and finally we need a generate function that gets the criteria and generates an answer okay so how might we query Astra with this well um data Stacks has a API so we'll import data API client from data Stacks Astro dbts and we'll instantiate the client and query it so here we'll say const client is new data API client process.env astrab application token con DB is client. DB um process.env Astra DB API endpoint these are environment variables collection is movies and now we can get data so what we can do is we can say const data is A8 collection. find whoa and we'll pass in um vectorize is the criteria incredible do2 array this should be all the data we want and we can just let's return just the data as a string this is probably going to look nasty but let's just validate that it's working so show me romantic comedies in Europe let's hit enter it's going to maybe Corey Astra going to fail oh my goodness okay so we got like a bunch of stuff in Json from Astra you can see ID and all of this it's kind of nice let's now see if we can return like UI from this so we have this component movies. TSX and movies it can take Json right an array of title poster path and underscore ID and return some like some UI what is what UI well links and a beautiful little movie picture so do we have that we have do we have title let's check okay so we have title this is great do we have um poster path okay we so this is compatible so let's just I'm actually making this up as I go now so let's return movies where movies is data oh no what's the problem is missing I think this is just wrong um save let's try again show me romantic comedies in Europe oh my goodness this totally works incredible it it gave me a lot so I don't I don't quite like this let's just ask for a limit of that is so cool though right um this is generative UI this is what we're talking about no chat Bots okay let's let's do better um and do a limit let's say limit four I don't want too many so we'll go here and limit is four okay let's do something different let's do um show me movies about computers I don't like this lag okay cool that works nice let's reload start from scratch and sh Show me movies about the future of AI this lag I hit enter it takes forever I really don't like that also her with hin Phoenix isn't in it anyway um we can do even better because remember remember I hope you're still with me I haven't looked at the chat in a while let me take a quick look at the chat to make sure you're still with me um because this is honestly the juicy part right you don't want to miss this um just a second I'm Tak a look at the chat a Nicholas is leaving all of you are leaving just as it gets good thanks for coming you'll watch the video after okay so we have some generative U however however we started this by talking about Superior and ux we want this to be like great user experience this lag when you hit enter and have to wait a few seconds it's not really the best ux let's fix this by adding some Polish um cow the princess yes you can get the recording later so let me share my screen and we'll finish we'll Land This Plane so I'll share my screen my entire screen and we'll go to our application here I want to be able to create a spinner or something because like show me your favorite movies I don't know if this is going to work but there so that latency wow who knew that AI open AI would have favorite movies and who knew that Predator would be one of them isn't that concerning anyway um so let's fix this loading situation well for those of you who know JavaScript there's a way to do this using generator functions so we just literally add the keyword function star and this says this function is a generator and a gener generator can return multiple times U by using the keyword yield and you can yield do some work yield do some work yield do some work and then finally when you're ready then you can return so let's look at how we might do this we can start by yielding um we have a spinner I think right somewhere spinner integration spinner let's yield this and we'll actually put this in a nice little div we'll use Tailwind Flex items Center a gap four Gap two um and we'll yield a spinner and we'll say whoa say something like searching Astra so we'll yield there when it's searching Astra then we'll yield the again we'll just say like rendering movies I don't know so now we know right where the work is being done so let's try this again um quakin Phoenix Greatest Hits I think this is not going to trigger the tool cuz I'm not asking to see a movie oh no it is great so now we actually also have that really great um spinner check it out so let's this is our finished thing right like um romantic comedies in Europe beautiful look at that searching Astra it's going to search as rendering movies oo stunning and now you can even because the text piece is still built in right this is still there you could do something like um describe the plot of one day and that's because text is exists this shouldn't do a movie search but it should actually generate some TCH perfect look at this we have like multimodo movie search and you could in the future when you have enough context about yourself in a vector database am I going to like this now it has no idea of knowing of course but see it's like could you give me your preferences but if it knew that um I am interested in huge monsters show me movies that I would like um there we go so you can oh wow that's actually really nice for those of you who haven't seen Godzilla minus one um let me know in the chat is it good I kind of want to see it I heard good things about it anyway um we went from nothing zero to getting data from somewhere loading it into Astra Astra vectorizes this data on the fly with one field and like that alone we're ready we also did the search in Astra itself remember that text field we just we validated it worked we went to langlow we built a API application as well and then we said okay cool this is great for a chatbot how do we do generative UI and indeed we did um using the versel aisk absolutely incredible this is I can say confidently truly a superior movie search when compared to the existing status quo of keyword matching um if you agree leave a thumbs up in the chat um we have a few minutes I'd love to take your questions if not I'm happy to also um leave it here so I I'll allow maybe I don't know like 30 to 60 seconds for questions and I'm I'm really happy to have a like a dialogue discussion in these last few minutes with you because ultimately this is for you right um I could do this myself I could do this to a wall if I wanted to but uh no this is for you the developer community so if you have any questions I'm happy to take them the input data yeah Antonia doel for sure let me show you the input data in fact if there's no questions I'm more than happy to uh how do you say I'm more than happy to like debug that python script and and figure out why it failed um so this is the this here um is the where is it let me open the project it was here this was the load movies script this was the input data let's format this a bit so it's just many it's about 5,000 rows of um movies by ID by Title by poster path and then how we actually ingest it into Astra is we use the unstructured URL loader from the Lang chain community's loaders of documents and what we're going to do is um load up the movie dbm movid the ID we get from here the movie DB has a really great API and then we get the pages content just the text content we clean it up there's this function called scrub that just removes a bunch of stuff like login buttons and so on and then we insert the entire Pages text content into Astra in a field called dollar vectorize and dollar vectorize is automatically converted into a vector embedding on the fly on Astra so that's the whole process and again if it fails you just like retry and so on now if there's no further questions in the chat oh there are I was going to inspect why that failed um can we do a recommendation for multiple databases so not just the description maybe user preferences can we do a recommendation from again this is the second time the question has come up about multiple something previously um there was a question about multiple columns and doing similarity search across many columns now the question from Bogdan is um a recommendation for multiple databases I mean in theory you can and you can stitch them together in your application logic but if your data is modeled correctly I'm not fully convinced that you have to because again Vector similar ilarity search searches for the similarity between numbers and these numbers are derived from strings so follow the logic here you could put a lot of the same or similar strings even across databases concatenate them into one string store them in one column in one database and and still all your features are captured in this Vector then you search for similarity for that vector and it will point you to the full record or another database or so on and so forth so I think there's a really great book a really really great book called um designing data intensive applications by O'Reilly um this book I have no Financial relationship to the book I am an O'Reilly author but um this book is required reading for anything geni really because it's garbage in garbage out and I I think there's a lot to be said for modeling your data bog in um I I'm not sure you should chain together multiple databases and there are probably better ways to do that all right next question from Sayad Jaffrey so where or how can Lang flow help for building Superior reduction ready experiences such a great question um let's walk through that a little bit as well given that we have some time I'd love to share my screen again um and show you here how we can do that with langlow so I already showed you how langlow can um help you build great rag experiences right um let's make that a little bit more practical so if we come here let's go to langlow and so we have this rag application um I could I could say something like um um respond let's go to open Ai and I could tweak the system prompt with respond only in valid Json and let's um turn on Json mode and now let's try this show me romantic comedies in Europe so it's going to do rag it's going to retrieve movies from our database use an llm to generate language but not English this time actually Json this is perfectly valid Json romantic comedies in Europe title description title description title that's cool but I don't want this key so then you can even introduce like schema adherence by just tweaking the system prompt um with schema movies name String description string and we'll add square brackets to indicate an array you just write like some basic schema we'll try it again um and so you can rapidly iterate like this and really create a rag flow that is completely perfect reproducibly and deterministically and so it's going to think a little bit and we're going to get there we go so it's exactly as it described movies name and description so I can I can just make I can make an API so cool so we we're getting back Json but I can now go click on this API button and I get look at this I get a full HTTP API and of course you can deploy this in Docker in any host you want AWS or Azure we also have a hosted version of this on data Stacks you can literally just query this determinist so I'll come here I'll go to my terminal um and I'll just like paste this curl request right here um and I will pipe it to JQ um and we will get back a response from langlow so we it's like this diagram becomes an API that just there we go it just works look this is the resp want movies talk to me etc etc and it's Json right and so you can go very quickly from nothing to creating like a full-on um rag ready production ready API with Lang flow so um I hope that's super helpful I hope that answered your question as well Sayad we have two minutes left there's another question is there a way to filter first and then search for example filter on a field column then search the vectorized field at this point in time the data the data API and data Stacks does not support that it doesn't support filter first and then do Vector search it also doesn't support do Vector search and then filter um this is something we're working on and it's honestly Community feedback like this that helps us prioritize and make sure we serve developers so thank you for that Theo Theodor um Bogdan asked for the name of the book Thank You Abe for pasting the link and I believe with about a minute and a half to go that's the last question um again we have a minute and 15 seconds so if you have more questions again this is for you so I would love to answer that um any recommendations about how to start with versell or typescript um yes use geni perplexity doai or gp4 chat GPT can help you um I think perlex city. a is a great one because it does rag like it searches the documentation and teaches you in according to your questions so AE that' be my recommendation how can I deploy this on data stxs directly from L for cloud version um great question log in to data Stacks use langlow and it should be already deployed for you now the API piece is if it's not already available in data stxs Cloud it will be um shortly I believe within less than a month all right 30 seconds left hey thank you so much this was so much fun I can't wait to do this again with you I appreciate you um developer Community let's do this again okay thank you so much",
