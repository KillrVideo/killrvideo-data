  "title": "Build a GenAI App in Under 20 Minutes: Demo of DataStax’s AI Ecosystem (Preview)",
  "description": "Carter Rabasa, Head of Developer Relations at DataStax, demonstrated how to build a GenAI application in under 20 minutes during a live demo of DataStax's AI ecosystem at the recent RAG++ event in San Francisco. He showcased ingesting movie data from The Movie Database into Astra DB, highlighting the database's vector search capabilities. Using Langflow, an open-source tool, Carter created a smarter Netflix application capable of performing intelligent searches. Integrating Langflow's API server with a full-stack JavaScript application, he also showcased the observability features provided by Langsmith.
