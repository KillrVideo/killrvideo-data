    "text": "hi everyone i'm alex i'm on the marketing team at data stacks and today i'm going to show you how to launch a sample react to-do list app using asteroid that will find git pod so we're going to start by pulling up the sample app gallery this is a really good place to find templates when you start building your next app using astra so i'm going to go ahead and select the to-do list app this is going to pull up github um and if i scroll down a bit you'll see there are instructions on how to get going on the readme and we have kind of three paths um you can walk through the first is if you want to run the app on your local machine the second is if you want to run using git pod which is an online ide and the third is how to deploy this app to network um so today we're going to walk through steps two and three so the first step is to go ahead and create your asher account um so i've done that already um and once you've done that you're going to want to create a database um so i'm going to go over to astra and the first screen after you create an account is this create database screen um so here i'm going to plug in the region i'm going to name my database i'm going to name the key space and then set my database username and password and once once you've gone and done that you're going to hit launch database okay cool so astro is doing its thing i'm going to start launching uh get pod to do that i'm going to go back to the readme and i'm going to click this opening git pod button and this typically takes 30 seconds to a minute to get your get pod workspace going all right so you can see the workspace is started and in the console here we're installing the node dependencies all right so the node dependencies are finished installing and you'll now see i'm asked to plug in my astra database details so i'm going to plug in the username that i just set the password the key space my database id which i can find right here along with the region and then i'll hit enter and this is going to set up the database create all the tables necessary to run my example so we can see that's done we can see that the the app has been built and i'm going to go ahead and hit open browser and here you can see my app is now live running a gitpod i mean i can interact with it create a to-do list item and this is connected with datastax astro so now that we've done that we're going to deploy the app to network so i'm going to go back to the readme and there's a similar deploy button so i'm going to go ahead and click that i'll connect my github account and then here i'm going to be asked for those same database details i used in the git pod step i'll go ahead and plug those in and then once you plug in those details we're just gonna hit save and deploy so here we're going to be taken to the netlify app overview page and we can see that the site deploys in progress and we can see uh the link turned green the deploy was successful so i'll click that link and my app is live so we've successfully deployed a react application i'm talking to deus ex astra to network",
