    "text": "[Music] hi i'm patrick mcfadden let's talk about the fundamentals of an apache cassandra table there is a lot of terminology with an apache cassandra table and just apache cassandra in general and so i'm going to run through these things keep in mind this is the place where you need to understand all this terminology because it's the most important part of a data model and when we start digging into like the different terms and what they mean this will make or break your data model eventually so if you're going to pay attention this is the time to pay attention so let's just start with the basics the data model what is that well data model is not just a cassandra topic that is definitely something that is in every database every database has a data model the type of data model each one has is going to be different based on its capabilities for cassandra this is something very specific for what it does and how it does it so the abstract model for this is how it gathers the data how it uses the data and definitely how it stores the data and i think this is one of the most important pieces that you'll understand is how cassandra stores data because it will make your data models better a key space is the larger part of a data model a key space stores tables it also stores information that's pretty critical to say replication it stores replication data and where your data is in relation to the rest of the cluster so the key space is a container for sure and if you're using something like mysql or oracle that would be like a schema a table should not need much explanation if you've ever worked with a database tables are rows and columns right that's what we've always seen a cassandra table is a little different but it is fundamentally the same type of thing now there's nuance inside of it and how we work with it for instance how the primary key works with that table but the tables are contained inside the key space a partition is where we start getting into more specific cassandra related topics a partition isn't exactly a new topic for any database but it's very specific on how it works with cassandra one of the things that you need to understand about a partition is this is really where you can make or break your data model right there so we're going to dig into that quite deep so a row of data is again a pretty normal concept in databases but this is what stores all the columns now row is contained inside of a partition and i think that's one of the interesting differences between cassandra and say a relational database a column is the same as what you would see in a normal relational table however we treat columns a little differently column like row very similar to what a relational database does but these are the individual items inside of a row a primary key now that is a part of cassandra that is very unique in a lot of ways and something that i'm going to dig into quite a bit i've talked about this a lot in the past where primary key is the most important part of your data model i'm going to prove it to you in this module the primary key does two things it guarantees uniqueness of the record but it also defines the placement of that record in your cluster that's the unique part the partition key which is a part of the primary key is that part that shows where in the cluster your data is this is a pretty key concept and we'll go into it quite a bit and this is also an operations topic but today we're just going to talk about the data model portion of that and clustering column again pretty unique to how it works in a primary key with cassandra but clustering columns give you some order in your data and that's the unique part of it we'll dig into how you can get that ordering and how you can control it and how it can be a really useful and powerful part of your data model this is a pretty good graphical overview of what a table looks like by the end of this module you should be able to explain this to somebody you know about what a table actually is in cassandra can't have a database without data types types are important and this is a very crucial part of a cassandra database because inside of that database is typed columns it's not just random data there are some databases out there that are schema-less that don't really assign type or try to guess type as the data's being put in no you have to define the types in your columns before you do any data work understanding the data type is really critical to your data model because that's what sorts things gets in the right order it also controls how that data is stored on disk which is really critical for say read speeds and that's why we're going to really dig into these pretty hard if you look at these right here these are just normal text types the text data types are ascii text varchar now varchar is probably one you're used to seeing quite a bit if you work with relational databases there's not a lot of difference between these three and that's really the critical part here the ascii one is different because of the different character set is using us ascii which is very limited normally you'd use text or varchar because utf-8 gives you a larger character set and that is probably where your data is going to be anyway so just use those ascii is very specific but it does exist as a type now keep in mind that types are going to do some validation as well they're there for validation so if you try to put in a character that's outside of ascii character range it will throw an error and that's what we expect from our types types help constrain they give you enforcement and these types will restrain you against text data types which aren't as onerous as others which are probably more useful we'll get into those for instance integers integers are definitely needing to be constrained all the different types in here need to be controlled whenever you input data into it you are expecting a certain type for instance a tiny in or a small ant big difference if i put in text characters not okay big and that's another one if i don't have a type that's large enough and i use an int when i really need a big end again it's going to throw an error that may be you trying to enforce your data types so that you have application logic that uses that data properly now there are some others in here that are very similar but look at the different types and how they work for instance a var int is very unique but it's one that is useful in those cases floats and doubles again something you probably already know about if you use any kind of programming language that uses static types the biggest difference being float is small double is huge but those are really there to enforce so if you try to put in something that's a float that's not a float then you're gonna get an error the date types this is one of the ones that i really love i love a good time series data model and i use these a lot the date it should make sense to you if you've ever worked with unix systems that of course everything in the world started on january 1st 1970 right let's just use date a lot less anymore because let's face it at this point we're going to run out of 32-bit unsigned integers around 2032 so let's just not use data anymore duration is a different type of number and that's really now the new cool thing using assigned 64-bit integer it won't run out of space at least in your career so don't worry about it time and time stamps are ones that i use quite a bit timestamp probably the most because that's the one that fits into most of the data models you get from application logic now this is a 64-bit signed integer since e-puck now that means it has a lot of room to grow it's not going to overflow in 2032. good just use timestamp most of the data models you'll see me give examples about use timestamp pretty effectively in a time series data model the other two types here uid and time uuid are really critical when you're working with a distributed system pretty common concept within distributed systems for cassandra we use these in our data model quite effectively uuid stands for universally unique identifier and if you're in the microsoft world guid globally unique identifier same thing it's just this really big number it's a 128-bit number that is generated in a way that's more or less guaranteed to be somewhat random in the universe i'm sure there's a way to prove that it isn't always going to be completely random but for the world we live in it works awesome and it gives you enough room to work with with 128 bits where you can rely on that to be a unique number when it's generated the time uuid is part uuid and part-time stamp it gives you this best of both worlds where i can store some time information but have it be unique now if you think about when that's useful if you have exactly the same time stamp and you want to make sure that two things are stored separately and they're unique you slap a uuid on it and you're good but a time uuid is really different in a way that it isn't all 128 bits 64 bits of the time uid is time and 64 bits is the uuid portion so it's not the full 128 bit uuid good enough though with the time component and the uid component it's pretty unique and very useful in a lot of data models the specialty types now we call it that because we don't really have anywhere else to sort them let's face it these are the ones that are have to be there no matter what but they have kind of unique names so for instance blob blob is one that just throws some data in there there's no validation it's kind of whatever it's really useful if you have no idea again this is where you can find yourself if you just have no idea what your type is going to be make a blob you could throw anything into it inside of the database it's just a hexadecimal string could be anything it could be an image it could be a text string you never know boolean is that sharp yes or no true or false zero or one and booleans of course are very useful in any kind of programming logic but you can store the true or false as a data model in cassandra a counter type is pretty interesting because it's very unique to cassandra and is covered quite extensively in another module but in a nutshell what that is is this is what it says you can use it to increment decrement counts and it stores that as a 64-bit signed integer again it'll be covered quite extensively in another module but that's what that counter type is and then finally we have the inet type which i think is amazing it is an internet address and it validates either an ipv4 or ipv6 address really useful in those situations where you need to store an internet address and you want to make sure it's properly validated and sorted that is one of the unsung heroes of the cassandra data types i've seen it used in so many places like for instance fraud detection or in time series data models it's a good trivia question you could stump somebody with is there an internet type inside a cassandra yes or no the answer is yes and this is how it works so this is all the terminology you need to know about cassandra table and there's quite a bit of it from the types to the different things like partition keys and primary keys and columns and rows all of this terminology will be used throughout this course the more you know these things the easier it's going to be for you in the long run so if you have to rewatch this go ahead and re-watch it learn the terminology refer to the documentation but this is it these are the things you need to know",
