    "text": "[Applause] [Music] hello i would like to talk you through a small example to do quite operations with python against data stacks astra we'll be using this repo which is datastax examples covered with python node but we'll concentrate on the python code today the note is very similar it's all in the readme it's actually a pretty detailed readme and let's start with this table of content here the first step is to set up a database in astra if you haven't done this before you would need to go to the login screen you can get here by clicking on this link to ascer.datastacks.com or if you already have an account you can just sign in and then you get to a dashboard and i'm here already i don't have any databases at the moment so i can either add a database here or i can click on this button and let's get started with that we'll be using the free tier which is hosted on google cloud and since i'm based in europe i will go with the sweden europe best one but you pick whatever is closest to you and then we can configure now this is entirely your choice but we've tried to make life a little bit easy for you by giving you some default values which we've also populated in our code examples so you want to stick with that you have the least changes to make in your code but they're pretty simple changes anyway so you can choose what you like really so i'm putting this in my ass requester then we need to select a key space name we'll be using spacecraft key space name in this example the example is about recording small journeys by spacecrafts and their telemetry data so this is appropriate and the user is as user and the password is as password one and then you can create the database this will take a couple of minutes currently the status is pending a couple more minutes we should see it as active and then you can actually start using it oh it's coming on but i think in the meantime i'll show you the other component we'll be using in this demo which is we will use an online ide git port which you can start straight from this github reaper so you can click on this one here and then you can open this in a new tab and this might take a couple of minutes as well it's basically creating the docker containers to in order to host this environment for us while this is working let's have a look and see active perfect this is what we want good so there's a couple of setup things that we want to do in the database before we actually start writing code against it and one of this is that we want to create the schema for our database we will be using the cql console to do that so it's logging me in as the user that i've created as user and yeah so we want to make sure that we use the right key space so use spacecraft you see that the front here changes to the spacecraft key space and then we'll take the schema from the readme here in the github repo right so just copy that out keyboard shortcuts command c in my case and paste that in with the command v and let it complete okay so that looks good the other console to get a bit more space let's grab tables and i now have five tables set up so after spacecraft journey catalog this will basically hold you know details about intervals individual spacecraft journeys and then i have four tables that record technometry data like pressure over time speed location and temperature over time okay so that's pretty much all we need to do with the schema in the meantime let's have a look whether our gitpod is up it is up and i think i'll make that a little bit bigger so hopefully that's easier to read so gitpod is basically just putting everything from the repo into this ide and we will be working with the python code which is in this directory quite python let's go in there okay perfect you can also see the readme from here right so you can look at here what you want to do next so this is the i think it might be easier to read if i show it to you in the in the proper github repo okay let's go here right there's another thing we need to set up and that is we need to set up the driver connection to the database and for that we need to have all the security credentials and we can get them from astra as well so we go back to our database we can go to the summary here and select connect which gives us a couple of options how we could connect we could rest api or graphql but we want to connect with the driver and you see here i have here the ability to download a secure connect bundle this is basically a zip file which connects all the which includes all the credentials you don't want to download it into my host machine i want to use it on gitpod so i'll just copy the address copy the link address and then i go to gitport and i'll curl this into this directory so occur minus l make sure you use double quotes paste this really long link and then redirect this to threads. you can name it anything you like but this is pretty short and sweet so this is successful if you've downloaded about 12 kilobytes if you have less than that your link might have expired this link here is only available or valid for five minutes or so so if it expires you can just reload it and then take a fresh copy of that lick to make sure you get a valid bundle okay but this looks good let's have a look that we have it in here yeah there you go stud zip cool good let's get started so the exercises are numbered exercise 2 3 4 5 etc and but before we can do anything we will need to define the connection object so this is in here in db connection py and you see here we have the class connection which establish the cluster instance which connects the secure connect bundle and the credentials and connects to that key space so we want to set that up correctly and here it comes in handy if you've used the default values that we've used when we set up the database basically this is here the path to the credentials that we just downloaded yes the username and the password and key space so if you chose anything different you would want to update that here but that's the only place where you need to update that okay good so in get part we have a nice terminal here so let's clear this next we're now going to exercise two and you want to do a basic connection test right so we just want to see we just pull something you know from the database this is a system key space so there's always something in here and if we get a successful connection print it out and if not tell us you know a little bit about the mistakes and um and then close the connection okay let's do this then two and run it i forgot to install the driver of course let's do this first so do pip and store cassandra driver area perfect sorry about that let's try this again to place them and the starting exercise you're now connected to the cluster cars cluster this is just the internal name that just using success perfect we are all done so this is the basic connection test let's start something a bit more interesting we do an insert so this is a basic create statement right look at that a little bit so you're basically in our connection session we're executing a very basic statement here insert into spacecraft journey catalog you give it a spacecraft's name journey id and then we pass these parameters facebook name journey id false and a little bit of a summary message we set up the journey id up here displacement's name here and we'll be using this we'll be using a hard-coded uuid here because we will be reusing it in all the other exercises but as you see here from the comment you would really want to create your own time uuid here to for your own individual journey okay let's run this python exo3 insert the journey starting exercise and it's telling us the journey was created for this uuid if you want to you can now check in astra let's go back to our console wait for it to login again use the spacecraft key space again and then we select or from the journey cutoff and there we are we have inserted a record so that's a basic very basic create statement exercise four updates this record because we want to be alive right you want to be on our journey so we want to uh we want to update the journey stages to to true so and then we say we have taken off right so we use again a very simple statement here so we use uh update spacecraft journey catalog set active to true and then we're setting a start time and in this case we're preparing the statement so we're preparing this as an update preparing passing of the prepared query which is the recommended way if you deal with a lot of queries of the same type it's kind of like a template that both the driver and the database know about and just speeds up execution and then the execute the prepared statement with those bound parameters okay and then here we have the current time so let's clear this up and to type in exo4 take off and it's taken off and again we can see that we have the same record but it's been updated right active is now true and we have a start time so this is the basic update but it's using a slightly advanced concept which is the prepared statements over the simple statements next step is the most interesting module of all of them so this uses a couple of concepts a how to do with udts with user defined types and also with batches so it might be worth looking a little bit more into this we've explained it in detail in the readme so if you go to [Music] this two four five you can find quite a little bit of explanation here about those things i'll show you just where to look in the code so here we're setting up a class for the udt the location object where we're defining the exponent the y coordinate and the z coordinate and then later on in our location statement we're actually reusing that so we're using the location sorry location here and then we're passing that class into that class instance into it here location of xyz right okay and then we're using the concept of a batch statement which basically bundles the different individual statements together into a single atomic update so we have a batch statement and then we add these additional statements in there and we're using those prepared statements for it and then we execute the batch so that has an ex or five perhaps before i execute i should tell you what's happening we are basically simulating the telemetry data here right we're going to simulate a thousand updates both for all for location speed temperature and pressure right then we have some simple simple sort of like logic here to make that a little bit interesting to give you some values but we're going to insert basically 4 000 records into the database now a thousand into each of those four tables that store the telemetry data let's see how that works put a bit of a sleeper here in order to sort of like simulate the traveling and let's get started with that there we are we're traveling and you can actually check what's happening in the meantime so we can for example do a selector from spacecraft temperature over time and there we go we've got already loads of data you can control c out of this if you want to okay so that worked and that's done and that was all for that spacecraft journey the next one is again just a simple statement where we are completing the journey so we want to update with an end time of the journey and set it to false in terms of active right so the updating this spacecraft journey set up to false you know and create an end and time there okay so there's nothing magic there but we just want to complete the journey so python six and it has landed perfect you can go back and have a look and now we have it all completed the end time has been updated and we had a start time and it's set to false again cool so this is all that we have in this exercise for updates so we have creates and updates we're actually not showing a delete here but the delete works very similar now let's focus our attention to the read statements first of all we have one here which is very similar to what i have just sort of done in the um in the console we're just selecting everything from sweep of journey catalog but in this case we're actually specifying the spacecraft name right and we've been using the crew dragon endeavor spacex name throughout this example and then we print that out let's do that so it's a very simple read yeah yeah we only have one journey right so we only see one record so this is purpose and first highlighting this is pulling out all the journeys for that spacecraft name so if the spacecraft went onto several journeys it's pulling out the entire partition for that spacecraft name let's go to this one here so this is a little bit more interesting we're looking at the details from for a particular journey so we're selecting again from the journey catalog where the spacecraft name matches but now also we're specifying a specif particular journey id and then this illustrates a little bit how to pass your rows that you're getting from the database so you basically can select based on the column name right so we want to vote journey id space left day summary active start end and we want to print that out so let's have a look at that python 608 there we go and that's putting out all the details for us the uid the name the summary and all the other details that we set okay let's look at the metrics the telemetry that we data that we collected right so again this is just sort of like passing this out for the row and it's adding a little bit of additional details here so we're just numbering the rows you know we've got a counter in here that we're increasing so it's like as a row counter and then the time the reading time the low speed and this is just focusing on one of those telemetry tables which is the spacecraft speed over time and again is pulling out very specifically for one spacecraft and one journey id so that and number a in number nine and that is probably not so useful because it's just putting out all the thousand records in one row right so depends whether that's what you wanted personally i don't find it that useful to have that much data in one swoosh which leads to the next example which allows to read in with paging where you want to page through all these examples so this is exercise 10 and here you're very basic um getting a paging state from the output so the output is what we're getting so basically the row information what we're getting from this exercising this statement the statement is select staffing space but over time they'll be selecting specifically the spacecraft name and the journey id and we are specifying in our statement that we want to have a fetch size we want to only pull 10 backwards we only want to fetch 10 records so we're passing that with the statement then we're executing this statement which with this fetch size and in our output we get an additional information which is the paging state and we're using that paging state as a pointer to pull the second page here's the second page we're calling the same statement again but this time we're specifying the paging state to start where we left off the second page right so if all goes well we should actually get two pages one with 10 records and the second page with another 10 records let's try that out there we are we've got two pages page one ten items here and page two with ten items and they're not the same right so the first page and then the second page and that was it i hope you find that easy to follow and i encourage you to try out the note which is exactly the same kind of examples in exactly the same kind of logic and order and they're very similar so any details are sort of like highlighted in the readme but yeah that concludes this little walk through thank you very much and enjoy",
