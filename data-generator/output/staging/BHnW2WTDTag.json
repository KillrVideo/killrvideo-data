    "text": "I'm uh Aaron from data stacks and um I'm here today to uh take you through a little bit about um HCD or hypercon converge database and how to accelerate um your AI applications with it. Um so yeah, let's uh let's get rolling here. Um let's see. Well, it might help if I actually put the uh correct presentation. All right, so here we go. Okay, our agenda today is pretty simple. Um, oh, you know what? I am not sharing my screen, am I? I I tell you, this one is uh is starting with all kinds of hitches, isn't it? All right, let's say entire screen and we're going to go this one and we'll share. All right, everyone sees an infinite window. Outstanding. Maybe I'll drag this one over here and then um go back to here and we'll start. Ah, okay. Great. Well, welcome again. Um trying to make sure that I'm centered here. All right. So yes, today um we're working on you know um accelerating AI development with data stacks HCD or hypercon converge database. Um our agenda is pretty simple. Um going to talk through a little bit about HCD and uh what makes it different. We are going to go through a little of uh provisioning a cluster. Actually all of the the uh the remaining points are going to be like like demo live land here. Um and hopefully everything will work out well. Um we're going to look have a look at the cluster as well through uh SQL shell which now you can do right through uh mission control. We're going to have a look at the data API and um if you were here I think it was last week. Yeah, if you were here last week, you know, you would have seen me um you know, give one as give a live stream as well on uh you know, kind of leveraging, you know, a lot of aspects of the data API and the table API as well, which is part of the data API. But yeah, we'll uh yeah, that that's for that's for another session. Anyway, and then finally, um we're going to hook up Langflow to our HCD cluster and uh see if we can get a uh like a small AI flow to work and then, you know, maybe work with it. um in some other ways. So let me all right. Okay. So HCD you know we we are we are getting a fair amount of questions about um you know what is HCD you know what makes what makes the the hypercon converged database or data platform different you know from data stax enterprise or even open source Cassandra for that matter. Um the idea with HCD is that this is our this is our path forward you know into to being able to you know support you know a lot of new integrations for for future state. um you know for instance you know we we have a lot in HCD and you know the newest version of D of DSSE dataax enterprise as well about um you know supporting things for um you know building applications with uh generative AI you know that use vector search um and a lot of other things like that um we also have you know integrations with um you know tools like Langflow you know if you've been paying attention to data stacks for the last you know year or So, uh, Langflow has been one of those things that we've kind of talked nonstop about. And, um, if you haven't checked it out yet, I highly encourage you to do so. And, u, and actually, you'll see you'll see why at the end of this, uh, this presentation as to, as to why it's so cool and why we're, uh, talking about it all the time. Um, and then the other thing is that, um, you know, we know that a lot of our customers like to use that Cassandra based enterprise database um, with search. So uh we are actively building out an interface layer for open search to um you know kind of meet that need as well. And we know a lot of our existing customers are on a um you know a version of like DSSE that integrates close closely with uh with solar and the idea is is that we're also going to be building some you know tools and layers that kind of make that transition from solar to open search as painless as possible. Um, so we're kind of kind of, you know, that that's that's the road map there. Um, you see right in the middle, you know, we have uh this thing called mission control. It's um it's what you might think is our our replacement for um for data stacks openter. Um what it does is it allows you to deploy, you know, HCD, um DSSE, and actually um regular Apache Cassandra as well. um and you can deploy it out to um you know any of the three major clouds as well as to your own on premise um Kubernetes cluster. So that is uh that is really cool that that mission control does that and we're going to show some other things today to um to also kind of demonstrate you know some of mission control's capabilities and and really what it gives you. So the idea with HCD is that it's it's innovation beyond just Cassandra. Um the thing is is is that um with with a lot of the big features that have been going into Cassandra lately, you know, uh like like acid transactions for one and uh and vector search for for another. Um, but acid transactions is one I'm I'm kind of focusing on right now because it's it's right around the corner, but development on it and testing on it has has really taken a little bit. So, the idea though is that um you know, we Cassandra may have some of its its upcoming features blocked until that next release. But as far as as far as HCD goes, you know, our innovation at data stacks doesn't stop. So I mean we we go ahead and make sure that um you know our enterprisegrade products are using the latest and greatest um edition of J Vector for vector search as well as the latest edition of um you know SAI or storage attach indexing. Um and the newest version of storage attach indexing gets you all kinds of cool things. You know it gives you an or operator. you you know you can do excuse me you know various uh operations with a little bit of pattern matching um and you can also sort by an arbitrary column with um you know sivv2 um so those are just some things that you get with HCD that aren't quite in Cassandra yet and they will be they're down the road but um but yeah HCD kind of gets you kind of gets you around that and uh gets you the latest and greatest. All right. Well, that's that's about it for the slides. I didn't have a whole lot. A lot of this is going to be um uh you know, kind of uh kind of building and showing live here. So, uh with that, let's jump over to mission control here. Now, this is mission control if you haven't seen it before. Um basically, I like to call mission control Kubernetes on easy mode. So it does a lot of the great things that you need Kubernetes to do um without a lot of dropping to the command line and uh running cube control commands. I mean there's still a little bit of that but the uh the mission control team is really doing a great job of um you know extending a lot of that that advanced Kubernetes functionality into mission control and making it so that you know things are just things are just kind of on easy mode for you. Um, I have a single cluster out here. Actually, this is my uh my co-orker Jeremy who uh has spun up a cluster out here, but you can see a kind of kind of the cool thing is that when you click in, you can see the nodes. Um, you get a view of the data center as well as some stats about it. Um, you get built-in observability and metrics. Um, kind of the cool thing with mission control too is that if you don't want to use our metrics, you can absolutely plug in your own and um and configure that on the back end with uh with mission control. Actually, I'm pretty sure I have a video out there where I've done that and um and actually like sent the metrics from mission control over to like an external um Prometheus installation. But uh anyway um you know kind of the cool thing too is that you can look at look at the logs here as well and uh you know kind of get a view as to what's going on with all the nodes or you can just go by one particular node and see those logs. Um really useful tool. We have a connect tab up here. And the thing about the connect tab is kind of like it does with Astrod is that you can go through here and uh kind of pick your language of choice and it'll go ahead and walk you through building out like a simple connection based application to uh go ahead and select from the database. Excuse me. So there's there's all that. um we actually have um you know a way to expose like the the CQL gateway um and deploy and expose the data API as well uh which we're going to get to in a little bit. But again, the idea here is that you can do this all in mission control. Um, and then with the data API, you know, kind of as um, as I showed last week that, uh, you know, you can actually access your database with, um, like a restful type of configuration or, uh, or request. Kind of also cool is that you can go right to the CQL console from within mission control. Um, I'm not going to do it here because I don't know uh Jery's password, but um, you know, I'll go ahead and show you on on a different one as well. Um, let's see here. Yeah, we'll do a leave. Um, you can also initiate repairs as well. Um, you can schedule them. And the cool thing is that kind of like Cassandra Reaper, it'll just kind of do this on its own. In fact, this does use Reaper on the back end on its own. Um, but it it takes you away from that work of having to set up a Reaper cluster and the Reaper application and then configure all of your clusters in it. Mission control just kind of does it. All right, let's let's jump over to here. So, this is my cluster that I have. Um, it's called Farewell to Kings. Data center is named Xanadu. I have three nodes and one of them is actually restarting at the moment. Um, so we'll we'll try to hope that uh you know these these two nodes that are running here can uh can keep us going. Uh but if I have a look at um you know repairs, you can see there's been a couple repairs have been done even though I haven't I haven't oh there are there are some active schedules. Oh, we'll look at that. All right. But uh anyway, yeah, the point is that this is all super easy. You know, one thing that um kind of has not been easy traditionally with Cassandra has been backups. And um you know, the the cool thing here is that you know, you can go ahead and create a uh schedule for a backup. You can designate a data center that you want backed up. Um and it goes to um to your config. So, so you have uh inside of mission control, you can configure a backup configuration that that has like an S3 bucket location or S3 compatible bucket store and that's where your backups actually end up. Um, so backups tend to get insanely complicated, especially in a very large cluster and especially because each node and its token configuration is unique. So, a backup from one node really isn't any good. than any other node, which has kind of been, you know, the blocker to a lot of people doing backups in Cassandra. But again, mission control just takes that out of your hands and makes that super easy. All right, so let's go ahead and um and take a look at what we've what we've got here. Um, if I go to the connect tab, oh, sorry. If I go to the CQL console here, um, let's log [Music] in. There we go. So, you can see that I'm I'm in here. Say describe key spaces. Actually, let me see if I can increase that sizing a little bit better here. There we go. I hope that helps some. Um but the idea too is that um you know data stacks HCD is uh is very similar to Cassandra. Um you in fact we can go ahead and do a select star from system local and you know that should look very familiar to a lot of you. You know, same thing. I can have a look at uh system peers as well. And uh you know, again, this is all this is all very similar to um you know, to what we what we see when we do this in Cassandra. So, it functions very similarly. Um we are actually going to use uh a key space that I have called default keyspace. Um and right now it is completely empty. So, uh, the idea is that we're going to put some things in here. Before we do that, though, let's have a look at the data API. The data API is actually how we're going going to get um all of our data into HCD today. So, what I'm going to do is open up a new tab and I'll paste that and we'll say swagger UI. So right now, as you can see, this is my um my cluster endpoint up here. Um and port 8181 is for the uh the data API. Um and all I all I put on the end of this was swagger-i and it found the rest of this here. Um so you can see that these are all of the you know commands that are available that you can run um you know from a uh from restful endpoint here. Um so you know I can kind of open this up. I could do a create keyspace if I wanted to. Um, inside of key spaces here, I could do a create collection. Um, there's there's all kinds of things that that you can do here. And the cool thing, too, is that you could test this out. You put in your token and um, you know, actually actually use this through the swagger UI right here. It's pretty cool. Um so what we're going to do is um is we're actually going to um have a look at Langflow. Now we have Langflow tightly integrated with AsterDB. Uh but for today what I've done is I've actually spun up Langflow as a uh ECS elastic container service inside of uh AWS. So let me go to tasks and here we go. This is the public IP. So, if I grab that IP, open up a new tab, and then Langflow should be 7860. All right, so we have Langflow. And like I said, if you haven't used Langflow, basically, it's a component-based drag and drop guey that lets you build generative AI applications. Um, so you can build things with with agents and chat bots um and and other, you know, the various components that go into making those um those pieces work. And you can do that all with Langflow. It's uh it's super cool. So I'm going to show you just how easy that is. We're going to build a simple um AI based shopping assistant here. So I'm going to say new flow. And you notice I get these these three options that come up you know one for basic prompting one for vector store rag another for a simple agent. Uh we are going to go with vector store rag. So once you do this you'll notice that um you know you get two distinct flows here. You get the data loading flow down here and then you also get the chat flow up here. So for now we're going to focus on the data loading flow and uh and get this built. So first things first um we are actually not using AsterDB. So in the components over here we're going to go vector stores and we have a special component for the hypercon converge database. We're just going to drag that out here. All right, which means that we can delete that. Um, and then tie up embeddings and tie up ingest and just connect everything like that. And it's it's super duper easy. So, um, let's also have a look at the controls here. Um, our default name space. Yeah, I want that viewable. And we are going to name that keyspace. There we go. That way it matches up with what I've already got built there. Um, for the collection name, we're just going to going to say shopping AI vectors. Just like that. All right. Our username is uh going to be just a second. And I have to check name of my cluster one more time here. Oh, that's Jeremy. Let's go back to overview. Yep. Leave. And I don't need that to be so big. All right. Farewell to Kings. That's it. So, [Music] it's farewell to kings super user. Let me paste in my password. And then we have that uh URL endpoint that we used for the swagger spec. We're going to go ahead and paste that in as well. Um and you can see that goes all the way up to the port number of 8181. Um name space is default. Keyspace. Okay, this should be okay. Um, let's go ahead and let's see. Let's get a let's get a file in here. Oh, hey, perfect. Um, I have a a file of product data that we're going to use for our shopping assistant. Um, I think last week I talked a little bit about the um the e-commerce workshop that we used to do and the website that we had built. Well, this is the uh the product data that's been uh exported from that just in a CSV file. Pretty simple. So, we'll go ahead and select that. Um, and then the other part of this is that uh we are not using Open AI. So, let's go ahead and get that component out of here. [Music] Um, we are going to want an embedding model. And since we're using Amazon, we're going to stick with uh Amazon for everything. Don't mean to do that. There we go. Oh, and it comes preset with my AWS key and secret. All right. So, let's just com connect up our embeddings nodes. Okay. So, if we did everything right, um this should create this shopping AI vectors collection inside of our default keyspace. and it should load it with the the product data that we h have in this file here. So, let's go ahead and just click the little run button up here. Oh, actually, you know what? I'm going to uh reduce our chunk overlap. There we go. Let's do that. Well, so far so good. All right. You know, while that's running, I bet you Yeah, we can see it here. Let's have a look at CQL console. All right. So, if we do use default keyspace and I say desks. Oh, look at that. We have a shopping AI vectors table out there. Outstanding. I mean technically it's it's a collection um but when you're looking at it through CQL it'll it'll come back as a regular CQL table. So if I describe this shopping AI vectors table um this is actually what a collection looks like when you're viewing it as a CQL table. Um it has these kind of standard columns that we've built into it. Uh you can see that we do have our our query vector value here which is a type vector um which and it's uh and the vector is a float of size 1536 um which is which is common for most uh most chat models um so so yeah you you can also see you know we have several storage attach indexes built onto this uh onto this table as well and that's really what kind of um extends a lot of that functionality that we have from the collection and document paradigm that we don't normally get at the CQL level. So, hey, this at least created the table. Let's see if we have any rows out here. So, we can do a select star from um shopping AI vectors. Oh, look at that. We have 24 rows. Outstanding. And as you can see the uh the vector embeddings themselves are you know visible here as uh as that um 1536 dimensional vector which really is just made up of the uh I think the long description being being um you know vectorized if you will into an embedding. So yeah this this looks like it worked. So if I go back to Langflow. Okay, everything's good. All right. So, we've managed to go ahead and load our data. Let's um change our focus here to the to the chat flow. Um so, the idea with the chat flow is that it's it's going to take this um you know, kind of conversational approach. So, the first thing we're going to start with is is this chat input, which we default to what is this document about? Well, I'm going to say something like, \"Can you help me find a purple shirt?\" We'll just we'll just do that. Okay. So, let's go through this bit by bit here. Now, we know we're not using AsterDB as a vector store. So, let's get rid of that. Let's go down to the hypercon converge database component that we've already built, put together, and tested. We know it works. Um, we've used it to load data. And again, kind of the cool thing in Langflow is it gets you this little drop down and you can say duplicate. And look at that. It just gives it right back to you. So then I can take this up here. Now, um, this needs to be, let's see here. The data frame node goes up to the parser. And I think that's all we need to worry about for Oh, right. Chat input message should go to the search query node. All right. And then we have open AI for embedding. So we also need to delete that and go down to Amazon Bedrock. And here we go. We can say duplicate. All right. Now we can run this back up here and then connect up our embedding nodes as well. Okay. Um we're in really good shape here actually. Um that should all be okay. So the next thing is that uh we do have to adjust the prompt a little bit. So if you have a look at the prompt here, it's it's pretty pretty simple given the context above. Please answer the question as best as possible. Well, you know, for our shopping assistant, uh that is just um that's not going to cut it. So, I have some additional rules here that I have written up and I'll just paste those in and say, \"You are a shopping assistant for the Astro Apparel online clothing store. You must only answer questions about Astro Apparel products. You may only use the product data in the provided context.\" This is important because otherwise what'll happen is it'll just make up generic answers. Um, and we we've also told it we're also going to tell it that it can't use any outside or other sources for answers. So, it's restricted to the context that's in our database and that we have an HCD right now. Um, and then of course you must format your responses about product data like you know product ID, description, image, etc. Um, this last line here, telling telling um a chatbot how to format the data you want back is actually really really important if you're you're having an application sit on top of Langflow. All right, so this should be good. Let's do a check and save. Okay, now this actually broke one of our connections here. I just need to double check. Yeah, we need to run from the message to the question. So the idea here is the chat input goes to the prompt and it also goes to the search query for the database. The output from the database actually makes its way to the context just like that. All right. So in this way you know we're we're having our conversational um you know approach with the uh with the large language model but our database is actually working as the context that it's going to base all that on. Okay. So we have another issue here and uh again we are not using open AI. So let me get rid of that. Now we need something different than an embedding model this time. For this one we just need a straight up uh large language model. So again, we're going to grab Amazon Bedrock. I'm going to run prompt message to input and then message on the bottom here to the chat output. There we go. Already injected my um ID and my access key. Outstanding. And I think the only other thing we need Oh, we are in US West 2. So let me just tick that. Um that Oh, right. I can pick from all of these different uh Amazon large language models here through Bedrock. I believe the one that I've been using is this uh Claude Sonnet 35. Yeah, 1022. That's the one I've been using. Okay, so that is our flow. Let's go ahead and click the run button here. Lot of pieces to this one. So, let's just make sure that we're doing everything right here. And it worked. Huh. Outstanding. Okay. So, next we can have a look at the playground here. And you'll see what it did for the uh for like kind of the default um you know run that it goes through testing wise. It it asks it asks this question of can you help me find a purple shirt? Oh, perfect. And yes, it found these purple shirts from data stacks, you know. So then I can say something like, uh, can you help me find a hoodie? How about that? Um, and this will spin for a little bit, but again, what it should do is um work through that Claude Sonnet V535 model. Yeah, there we go. And then use HCD as our context. And you can see it found a few hoodies here. Outstanding. Yeah, there we go. There we go. Okay, so this is this is working. All right. Um, next would be to um to have something that can actually use this. Um, so what we can do from here is um if I click this publish tab, you'll notice I get this um API access option here. So, um you can actually like take this and run it as a curl command. Um and you can you can kind of send send in your different uh input message. Um I'm going to go ahead and click on the Python tab. You know, you can see we have just some simple code here. Um there's a copy button here and I can click that and I don't think that works. So, what I'm going to do, fortunately, I anticipated this. Oh, let's see. Is our other No, our other pod's not coming back. Oh, well. Okay, let's go ahead and um jump over here. Let's do um touch. And we'll just call this [Music] um shopping assistant.py. All right. Right. And I'll actually use uh vi here. Oh, helps if I spell it right. There we go. Okay. Let's go to insert mode. And fortunately, I have all of that text from here. And let's just go ahead and paste that in. All right. So, as you can see, this is just a simple code that um you know, Langflow presented us. and it's uh it's got our input value of can you help me find a purple shirt. Um setting a request header of application JSON. Um kind of the cool thing is is that this is our own uh version of Langflow that we have running out there in AWS. So it it doesn't require any uh access tokens or anything. Um but this will just be this is ephemeral. I'm going to take this down as soon as we're as soon as we're done here. But uh anyway, all right. So this this all looks good. And then yeah, then the idea is is that it um it does a post request um to that lang flow URL and it goes to that flow that we just um you know that we just built. So let me do a right quit on that and let's do Python shopping assistant pi. And if we did everything right here, we should get a uh JSON response back. Come on. Come on. Hey, there we go. Look at that. Okay. Okay. Oh, it's saying it doesn't have access to that. That's really That's really strange. Yeah. Well, it's absolutely hitting our our URL, but for some reason, it's having a hard time with the with the flow there. Oh, you know what? I bet I know what the problem is. Let's go back to VI here. Um, I bet you that this flow ID is not correct. Let's try that again. Oh, yeah. Look at that. It is different. H. All right. Oh, I hope I was able to copy that. Let me just Yep. Okay, that copied. Cool. All right. And then back to here. Okay. Let's go ahead and get rid of that old flow ID, which is what I tested with. And I can paste that in. Perfect. And we'll do a right quit. And let's rerun. Now, this time it should actually bring data back about the um about the purple. Oh, hey, here we go. Here we go. Yes, I found the following purple shirts. There we go. So, that was totally it is it was it was hitting an old um flow ID that um that wasn't necessarily working. All right. So yeah, that's um that's kind of a complete end to end. Obviously, if you wanted to do more, you absolutely could. I know for um for a for a demo at at um AWS reinvent this year, uh we actually had like a ReactJS shopping assistant that sat on top of a Langflow and, you know, kind of worked with that. Um so you could absolutely do more than just like a simple textbased um you know, Python approach like that. Um, you know, for some of you who haven't messed around with this a whole lot, you know, one thing you can do too is you can go into the prompt and, you know, you can you can add um, you know, other drills in here like um, you must talk like you are a pirate, you know, and you can do a a save on that. And then if we go back to the playground and say um can you help me find a Cassandra shirt? Let's uh let's see how it answers. I'm kind of curious on this. Y I spy several fine Cassandra shirts in our treasure chest. Here thy be. Yeah. So, there we go. You you get the idea. But, uh, you know, just so you get a little little example of um, you know, what uh what what something like prompt engineering can do to kind of help round out your uh your AI applications there. Um, so yeah, this is uh this is all this is all working. Let's see. So, if I bounce back. Yeah, we can go ahead and leave. Yeah. And I still have that one node that is just not coming back here. All right. I'm going to have to um I'm going to have to dig into that eventually. But uh the good news is that um you know even with one node down of course those of you who have used Cassandra before know that um you know Cassandra and HCD you know can handle one node being down and it's it's just not a not a big deal. So I guess this was a good example of um you know in terms of in terms of building applications that are highly available because even at 2/3 capacity it still ran my demo flawlessly. So um so there we go. All right. Well, all right everyone. Um that is pretty much all I had. Um again it was just you know a short introduction into uh the data stacks hypercon converge database. you know, showing that it's um it it's very much like Cassandra um with uh you know, a little more little more advanced uh tooling and libraries behind it to uh you know, kind of keep you on the cutting edge. Um you saw that it's it's highly available just like Cassandra as I was able to uh run through everything I just did with two out of three nodes. So, hey, that's that's great. um kind of with um with HCD, you know, you also get that data API that's that's seamlessly integrated in. So you can go ahead and make all of these requests with um you know, just through REST and without needing a special um driver or anything to uh to make that happen. So yeah, that is that is really about it. Um I see Michelle has posted in the chat here to see if there are any questions or anything. Um, I don't see any at the moment. Um, oh, no questions today.
