    "text": "hello everyone I'm Aaron plz from data stacks and in this short video I'm going to show you how to provision a new cluster using data Stacks Mission Control mission control is our new platform for provisioning and maintaining your Enterprises Cassandra footprint it provides ease of use and automation with that cloud native look and feel it's kind of like having Astra right in your own Data Center let's have a look okay so here we are in Mission controls dashboard or user interface and to begin with we're going to create a new project so I'll hit that create new project button I'm just going to name this project erands PR um that's really the only property we need here it'll create a unique slug at the bottom then we just click create project and boom done it's out there all right so we can switch over to that project um and now we have two buttons we can hit to create a new cluster pick one out in the middle here um I'm just going to name this um big box Co or like big box company cluster whatever uh I'm going to pick a Pache Cassandra and I want to install version [Music] 4.1.4 now let's go down to Data Center name um and you know my machines well I mean they're out in the cloud but I live in Maple Grove so I'll just say the name of the data center is Maple Grove yeah I don't really need any Cassandra settings or DSE anal settings I do need to pick our Google kubernetes um data plane context and then we'll just say Fernbrook for um you know one of the major roads nearby Fernbrook one there we go yeah perfect all right um I don't really need another rack so this should this should be okay nodes per rack H we'll just we'll go three not a big deal and we're just testing um host Network yeah that can be automatic um here's where we can set the minimum resources for each node so I want to make sure that each of these nodes has yeah that's good we'll go 8 gigs of RAM and I'll just pick a standard storage class and you know we really we don't need much maybe we need 10 gigs 10 gigs should be fine all right so I get an automatic big box Co super user so for the super user password I'll just go ahead and enter a password here I'll keep internode encryption up yep we'll just say big box Co for the backup restore prefix let's go ahead and set our Java Heap for uh for 4 gigs we don't need need to add an external data center not a big deal here this is a new cluster so we don't need any additional seeds and we can just hit create all right so as you can see um our nodes are in a current state of unknown so we've got our three nodes at the bottom there big box Co Maple Grove Fernbrook one two and zero or 0 one and two I should say if we click on observability you'll see that our yeah our graphs don't have much so we can take a look at the logs um hey look at that um it looks like node zero is actually starting to come up so that's that's good but um you know if we go back to the overview here well we can see that our nodes have gone from unknown to starting so that's that's certainly something oh and look at that our first node is up node zero has a status of running all right so we can click on that yep you can see our system Ram there um no storage that's our our Unix load um yeah if we go back okay the others are are still starting so if I say observability oh hey we actually do get some uh some graphs showing up now nice well now I can go [Music] um yeah just have the one data center yeah let's have a look at the logs all right so it looks like um no I see data in there or message in there for nodes zero and node one so now if I look for the word bootstrap yep you can see we've uh you know got node zero up there and then a bunch of messages on joining the cluster for node one so yeah this is good this is good kind of nice to have all of our logs for the entire cluster aggregated in one place go back to the overview see that uh node one is still starting up but it shouldn't be too much longer here oh there we go um node one is in a state of running just like node zero okay we're getting there just waiting on uh on node two here and node two is still in that state of starting you can see that um you know our node aggregation image up there you know shows that the two two nodes are up and running and one is in a status of starting all right if I take a look at that second node oh I see that it looks like it's running look at that so me if I go back to here oh excellent we have all three of them running now so that's it the the entire cluster is now up um running out at Google gke and um on Cassandra 414 we look we can see that uh that yeah our metrics dashboard is showing most of the graphs um as they actually do have data now so that's that's good all right I think we're good to go for more information on data Stacks Mission Control just head on out to data.com products Mission contr Control there you can find all the information you need including downloads and documentation thank you and have a great day",
