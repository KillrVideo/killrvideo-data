    "text": "[Music] hi i am artem chobatko and this is simple traversals simple traversals is a really good place to start learning about kremlin they should be easy to understand because simple traversals guide traverses through steps in a sequential order and contain no internal or nested traversals you can imagine gremlin the traverser this green creature guided by simple traversals hoping from one vertex to the next one and to the next one as shown in this illustration let's look at some of the steps we use to define simple traversals and of course these steps will be useful in other kinds of traversals as well they really form a foundation for any of the traversals that we are going to work with starting at the vertex here are some steps we can use to navigate to an adjacent vertex or an incident edge out instructs a traverser to move to any adjacent vertex that is connected to our current vertex via an outgoing edge with a matching label labels that we passed into out and all other steps are optional in tells the traverser to move to an adjacent vertex by traversing an incoming edge if you do not care about an edge direction you can use step called balls you can move to ages and vertices by traversing edges in any direction if you want to navigate to an edge you can use out e in e and both e they work the same as out in and both respectively except they move to an edge rather than a vertex the reason you want to go to an edge is usually because you want to access edge properties of course a picture always helps when we are talking about graphs check this sample graph out our traversal this little gremlin creature is on the movie vertex right now and there are various places he can go depending on the step we want to use for example out we'll move the traverser to the genre vertex and the person vertex and we will end up with two traversers if instead we use the in step the traversal will move to the user vertex similarly you can see how the traverser would move if other steps are used also please notice that we are not specifying any labels for these steps in this illustration this is a valid use case as labels are always optional we can always add labels as needed if our traverser is on the edge we have a different set of steps that we can use the out v step is going to move the traverser to the opposite direction of the edge towards the outgoing vertex in this case this is a user vertex in v will move the traverser to the incoming movie vertex and boss we will go to both end points of the edge finally the other v-step is a bit unique here it implies that the traverser has some state other we will move the traversal to the vertex that was not the vertex that the traverser moved to the edge from for example if we move to the h from the movie other v will send us to the user and if it came from the user either we will direct us to the movie the graph schema we are going to use for all our examples is based on the killer video domain in our graph we have vertices that represent movies users genres and people these are four types of vertices they can be related to each other by different types of relationships users may know each other and can rate movies movies belong to genres movies can have actors directors composers screenwriters and cinematographers and of course we have various vertex properties and even one edge property in this schema user defined vertex ids are underlined on the diagram user defined vertex ids are underlined we have no matter properties but we do have one multi-property this is the production property please take a moment to study this schema as it will help you to follow all of our traversal examples here is our first simple traversal within step we want to find titles of all movies with actor johnny depp that were released in 2010 or later we start with the vertex with labeled person and the name property johnny depp we then traverse incoming actor edges and end up on any movie where johnny depp acted in we further apply the condition for the movie release here it must be equal or greater than 2010. the final step in the traversal gets the titles of those movies that satisfy the condition in the output we see into the woods pirates of the caribbeans and alice in wonderland we use this has step a few times already now is a good time to take a closer look at has as this step is very common we will use it in all types of traversals not just simple traversals it turns out that there are several variations of this step that take different parameters first there is a test where an element has a certain property key for example we may want to check if a vertex has a property title second there is a test for an equality to a particular value we may be interested in verdicts with title alice in wonderland there is a variation with a predicate to test inequalities and more complex condition force you can even have a nested traversal as a test but we are not going to talk about nested traversals just yet fifths this variation also allows you to include label as part of the test and you should always use label whenever possible for better efficiency and so forth you should spend some time learning about these and other variations that we couldn't fit into this slide this example uses both in and out step in one traversal this traversal looks for directors of johnny depp's movies released in 2010 or later you may notice that we took the previous example and made it a bit more interesting we start with the person joining that verdict move to the movie vertices where johnny depp acted in limit the movies to only those that were released in 2010 or later and lastly we traverse outgoing director edges using out step to get to people who directed those movies and return their names we get three names but only two of them are distinct here to find user ratings for johnny depp's movies released in 2010 or later we will need to end up on rated ages and retrieve rating values associated with those edges this is achieved by getting to johnny depp's movies from 2010 or later and then using step in e to get the rated edges the result is a bunch of numbers representing user ratings now let's learn more about predicates some of these are really intuitive and don't require a lot of explanation like equal not equal less than less than or equal greater than greater than or equal those are usually used to compare values of properties you can also test equality and inequality of objects in a graph inside returns true if the incoming number is greater than the first number and less than the second outside returns true if the incoming number less than the first number and greater than the second between returns true if the incoming number greater than or equal to the first number and less than the second within expects to take a list of one or more objects and it returns true if the incoming object is represented in that list without is like the inverse of within inverse or negation if the incoming object is not in the list it returns true if the incoming object is in the list without returns false so far we only used predicates with hast tab but there are other steps like where and ease that are going to use predicates as well keep this list of predicates handy as they will pop up in many different types of traversals throughout this training now let's ask a slightly more interesting question of our movie database suppose you want to know how old is a typical user who likes but does not love the johnny depp movies made in 2010 or later that sounds like a complex question well we can do that by again going to the johnny depp's person vertex traversing incoming actor edges to movies and applying the greater or equal than 2010 predicate on year moving on to incoming rated edges and making sure that ratings are either 7 or 8. jump into outgoing user vertices and outputting user ages all steps used in this traversal should be familiar and even so we call this traversal simple it is really quite useful you will be surprised how many real life data retrieval problems can be solved using simple traversals and now it's time for you to be dangerous you can do it",
