    "text": "uh building a search engine uh for XKCD Comics um if you don't know what XKCD is man I don't know what to tell you you've been living under a rock it's just one of the most influential web comics um that has ever existed as soon as you're done with a stream go to xkcd.com and fall into a rabbit hole of hours and hours of you know nerdy geeky Comics um but we're gonna we're going to build this search engine of pretty much the entire Corpus of XKCD comics um using aite and using data Stacks um so once again thanks for thanks for tuning in uh I wanted to uh to take a minute um to uh to for us to introduce ourselves um so I'm joined uh I'm joined here by Bindy um an engineering manager from airite I'm gonna let Bindy uh introduce herself but um I'll uh I'll I'll go first um so my name is Carter rasa uh I work uh for the de developer relation team here at data stxs uh and um I'm I'm just sort of your your typical uh super nerdy uh web developer person um who's actually like relatively new to generative AI um so I I actually joined data Stacks um like a little over three months ago um and prior to that like I was I was sort of your standard issue web developer um I've used most programming languages you can imagine you know PHP python um even back in the day Java Ruby on Rails um and but lately I'm more of a full stack JavaScript developer um and I really hadn't done much with AI until late last year um but now I've been diving into it um like with a lot of like enthusiasm and passion um and I'm super excited about it uh and I can't wait to show you um what we've built uh and what you can do um with generative Ai and airite and dig Stacks I'm located in Seattle Washington uh I'm a father I've got two cute kids uh and a lab roodle um and I am I am powered by Seattle caffeine and coffee uh so yeah that's just that's a little bit a little bit about me um I'm gonna I'm gonna turn it over to to Bindy to to introduce yourself thank you Carter thank you for having me uh hello everyone thank you for joining us my name is Bindy and I lead the AI and llm related initiatives air bite and we'll talk about air bite more later uh prior to airite uh I would like to say that I have a very diverse experience I've started two companies of my own uh work for bigger companies like Yelp Dropbox and Microsoft and my experience kind of ranges from consumer products to building B2B products and you know most recently like most of us I got super interested in gen so kind of did a lot of exploration pretty much all of last year and that is the exploration that actually led me to to this team at airbit where we actually kind of look at the aiu's cases and how they can use airbit better how we can serve those people better so I really look forward to sharing you know my thoughts with you today and you know show you a little bit of air bite and thank you for join where where are you dialing in from yes yes I am in San Francisco h of course you know it's the uh it's it's the hive mind of the generative AI Universe um obvious so um so it's awesome to have you um can you where sorry did you say that you worked at Yelp I worked at Yelp yes so I actually uh helped them build their in-house experimentation platform uh that's awesome I I go ahead no I'm sorry I I I went I went to I went to high school with the the founder and CEO of Yelp um Jeremy Stan I mean which of course I know you know I know you know who he is yeah yeah yeah we're yeah we're but we're buddies from mean huge huge Yelp fan I'm I'm I'm really I feel like we're going Off Script right like I'm super interested that you built like their in-house experimentation uh like platform and and Frameworks because that seems like a real natural step to like this world of of AI right these sort of like non-deterministic you know AB testings like you know iterate fast and improve things I think I feel like that that was like a nice I feel like that almost like kind of projected you into the world you right now yeah that that's actually very true and I actually did not realize that until I talked to everybody and I'm like wow my experience you know at Yelp is actually very relevant because we actually building data pipelines you know to move all the customer data all the way to Data Warehouse so we could run experiments on them so super relevant and yeah for AI you know everyone needs to move a lot of unstructured data structured data you know so they can do a lot of knowledge-based uh uh analysis and uh insights for their customers so I think data movement is you know definitely very relevant so I've got um I I always do this on our on our live streams I like to ask our guests uh you know a secret secret fun question um it's it's never very hard it may be slightly revealing um but I want to ask you like what is your like hot delicious energizing beverage of choice like when you're when you're starting off your day or or and and and whatever it is like where's your favorite place to get it oh so I love Celsius I don't know if I don't I don't even know what that is is that is that hot and that said Celsius is like some sort of canned or like bottle thing hot actually since we're talking uh you know beginning of the day well I'm drinking coffee right now but usually I love celsus is kind of like Five Hour Energy or six Hour Energy except that it's really delicious and I got hooked to it you know I go to the Equinox here my gym so they actually sell it so my favorite place is actually you know before I actually workout get a count of Celsius and it actually has a lot of caffeine basically you know four times this cup okay okay so so this is I'm so glad that you shared this so by the way folks on the stream um feel free to share like uh your versions of of the answer to my question right like let let let let let us let everyone know like how you like to kick off your day I'm G to blow bindy's mind a little bit so I love coffee you know I live in Seattle Seattle has amazing coffee I love coffee um but I I drink decaffeinated coffee um I I know and I every friend or developer that I talk to when I tell them that I don't consume caffeine they kind of can't believe it they think that I've lost my mind or you know that I must be sort of doing I must be just you know fueled by sugar or something but yeah I got off caffeine a couple years ago um and uh yeah it kind of changed my life a little bit um and your body definitely there's definitely a detox period that your body goes through when you kind of get off the caffeine um but uh yeah it's a it's funny I tell people this and they kind of look at me like I'm an alien or I have a third arm um but it's uh anyway it's kind of it's kind of what we're doing um okay all right awesome so hopefully everyone out there has gotten a better better feel for who I am and who Bindy is um we're just super excited to be here to ner out with you about Rag and data inest and uh in in the spirit of that uh we're gonna we're gonna start off with a quick introduction to arabit so I'm gonna I'm gonna ask Bindy to assume that me uh and all of you uh know almost nothing about AR aite um so we're going to get like a nice solid grounding in what aot is um what it's useful for um and I'm going to let Bindy take it away and uh and and Bindy I'll just remind you that um I may I'm gonna represent the voice of the average developer um while you're talking um so I might ask some clarifying questions as you're going along with your introduction um so yeah so go ahead and take it away yeah definitely thank you Carter uh so I would love to tell everyone about you know airb you know what airb is what we do so airite is you know a four year-old company we started during the pandemic and we started as exclusively open source and now we have you know both managed offering and open source offering so what is airbit so airb is the data Movement platform so basically we help you do etls we help you move data from one place to another place right so say if you're e-commerce company right and you want to actually uh collect your data from Shopify from mix panel from Google analytics from stripe all the way to a data warehouse say like big query so you can do some analytics on top of it then using airb you can do that so airb has a concept of source and destination so in this case you know the mix panels the Google analytics uh the Shopify those will be the sources of data and then there is a destination which will be you know your database it could be something like even Google Sheets or air table something that holds tabular data so you know having talked about that let me talk a little bit about um let me show you uh you know kind of what are the different ways you can use air bite so the first off you know what we encourage you to use and it's super easy to use and get started is airb cloud airb cloud is fully managed uh you can try it for free for two weeks and it actually gives you a very quick way to create source and destinations and I'll show that shortly and it's a fully managed UI so you don't have to worry about scaling and we just take care of Hosting all your infrastructure all your uh all your sources and destinations and one thing I actually didn't mention is you know when you connect your source to a destination so say when you're connecting your mix panel to Big query destination you're creating a connection we call it a connection and what we help you do is we uh help you move data from your source to your destination on a regular basis and each one of those uh moving data piece is called a sync so we can help you do sync on any you know any uh kind of uh uh Cadence that you want it could be daily it could be weekly you know things like that so that's airb Cloud then we have what we call airite open source so like like I said airb started as a open source company all our stuff is actually open source you can go to GitHub and you can look at all our connectors you know you can look at how we've implemented mix panel Google analytics all of that so you you have the option of actually just um uh putting these uh in your local machine uh in Docker or you can just host them in kubernetes so that way you can run our sources and destinations yourself we also offer what we call as airb self manage Enterprise so you can imagine that a lot of big companies they want all the infrastructure to be hosted by them and in that case you know when they scale they still want the monitoring and you know the reliability and the support that comes you know is very important for a big company we actually offer that for them and third offering we have actually is powered by airb which is super interesting actually and we realize that it's becoming more relevant with the AI companies so what is powered by airite so say I'm a I'm a gen you know a company that's building some sort of knowledge-based product maybe I'm building uh a product where I offer chat Bots to my customers right so in that case I want them to be able to ingest their data right uh and I offer that by actually uh building my service on top of air bite so what is powered by airite is actually a wh label airite it gives you all the all the capabilities of airite in your application so think B2B to be uh so with that I'll quickly show you um how we can actually how easily you can create a source and a destination in airb I have a quick question um for people that don't don't know the jargon what does ETL stand for ex oh yes yes very good question it's extract load and transform so what air does it extract and the load pieces and transform is what you're seeing a lot of you know with with rag actually and with AI where actually do a lot of transformation before you store the data in the vector database so we don't do that directly but we give you means to do the transform as well but airite are primarily the solution for extracting and loading your data from one place to another yeah that was a very good question actually so now wor I'll keep I'll keep them coming but go ahead so what you're looking at is actually you know what air bite it's actually very simple your connections will probably look more more complex what you actually see is a bunch of sources that I have set up so remember I was talking about you can get your data from mix panel you can get it from Google analytics here I have set up some sources like GitHub so when I go into it it's super easy to set up a source actually I just you know give it a name I've given it my personal access token and I've given it a repo actually so you need to give it a source to read data from and on the right you kind of have the setup instructions super easy and I've set up a Shopify source as well just to you know show you and I just wanted to kind of show that we actually have a lot of sources we have close to I would say 250 plus sources so you can see you can use Asana you can use Azure big Cory and you know it's like it's a very long list so you can go ahead and you know pick whatever you like and we also tell you whether something is certified or community so if it's certified you get better support on those sources and then let's me show you some destinations so this is a very simple destination so destination is anywhere where you can store data so here I've chosen to use like Google Sheets super simple so you you set a destination same way as you would set a source here I've given it you know a spreadsheet link and I've authenticated it from before with my Google credentials and again on the right side you you kind of have all the instructions super easy uh so it's it's hard to go wrong with that and I have a quick question Bindy um like do what is the process uh of kind of creating new sources or new destinations I mean I know that I know that airite the core of it is open source is it as simple as submitting a PR like how to how should developers think about um getting airb to support a source or a destination that doesn't already support yeah so say if say if you want to build a destination you know for your company right uh an under maybe you're just building S3 bucket but you want to label it as your destination then we actually have something which is I'm just I just came to the the Builder tab so you can actually we give you a note code of building your destinations and your sources and we actually have uh if you want to build it the more so what we have what we have is we call a connector development toolkit and using that we ask you to conform to some spec and it's super easy to actually build your own destinations uh or sources and if you to join our slack channnel we actually have slack channels dedicated to kind of helping you do that awesome thank you and yeah back to the destinations uh here I have Google Sheets and I just wanted to kind of show you what else we have to offer here we have astrab and then you know a bunch of others like yeah duck TB Google fir stor so I would say we have close to 80 destinations destinations where you can move data into so now that I've shown you the sources I've shown the destination I want to show you what a connection looks like so I go to my connections Tab and here you see in an interest of time I've already set up a connection from GitHub to Google Sheets let's see what that looks like so here you're able to actually really easy see you know when the next sync will happen what are the enabled streams so this is actually interesting so the way we know what to sync is you tell us what to sync right so say everyone knows GitHub say you want to sync the issues from GitHub and the request and the users from GitHub like you see here then you kind of specify it to us and we have that schema from before actually we show you list of all the things you can pick and you're able to like pick what's interesting to you I'll so that makes sense I mean so like yeah so that I mean the destination defines what you know what what exist what the schema looks like right like if I'm using Google Sheets like I don't have to guess like it's like you all know what the scheme is but then I have the power to select like or I'm sorry in this case GitHub I have this I have the the power to select the parts that I want and the parts that I don't want exactly uh I'll show you a little bit more so job history you saw sync succeeded so this job I've actually said to run daily you can run it however frequently you want and we do incremental sync so we won't try to sing the same records twice unless you want us to do a full refresh which is also an option and talking about schema now you can see that we know about all the tables in GitHub you know assignes branches all of those right so when I was setting up the connection I actually chose three of them for myself but you can choose as many as you want and say if I want to actually choose more then I'll have to set up a new connection because this has already been set but since you have your source and destination set you can easily set up a new connection uh so yeah so that was you know all about the the connection uh super easy to set up and one actually uh like I mentioned earlier aide cloud is you know super easy to get started we really recommend if you want to get air bu to try you can start with the cloud and one more thing I also wanted to share with you is oh actually before that sorry about that so this is the Google sheet that I'm actually writing data into right yeah awesome this this oh yeah oh and you put it you put it in different like I guess airite was smart and it like put the different things in different tabs yeah so airb knows how to do that um so every uh so say if you're actually uh loading data into uh bigquery or Astro be then airb would actually know how to set up those tables in the in those destinations nice and one more thing something we recently launched I really wanted to share with everyone so I kind of went over all the offerings you know the cloud the the self- serve and powered by air bite and the most recent product that we have launched is we call it Pi air bite so this is actually inspired by a lot of feedback we got from people in terms of you know being able to get started with air bite even quicker than using airb Cloud so what p airb is is that it packages all of Aires uh sources in a python Library so what that does is uh it gives you a really easy way to actually uh you know set up sources in your code so just kind of give you how easy it is all you have to do is do a pip install air bite and setting up a source in this case you know we're setting Source Faker but you can set a source GitHub really EAS easily all you do is set a source set up a config so you know if you're setting GitHub then it' be something like just giving your access token and then you're able to actually uh check source. check checks that the source is already set up the credentials are working and you select all streams and then you're able to just do a source read so basically whatever you saw in the Google Sheets that I showed you you're able to get that just with you know five lines of code uh so this is something that you know we uh we still in beta uh we launched it in public beta a month ago and so if you're wondering if you know airb is for you what are the capabilities you don't want to commit to Cloud you can actually go ahead and use the pite give it a try real quick this is super awesome I mean my um my read on this is like hey airite had I forget how many sources you said you had but it was a lot right it was like maybe hundreds um so my my sort of read on this is like hey python developers like if you just want like the easiest way to get access to like hundreds of different data sources with kind of like a single API right you know you don't have to learn like for 250 different apis like we'll sort of you can just learn the airite API more or less um and then you can just you can you can pull all those you know from all those data sources like right in your python code yes yes and we actually see a lot of people use it for actually their llm applications right so they would just use pyite pull some data do some trans informations use Lang chain or llama index and then write Downstream to a vector destination uh so Vector database this yeah this is super cool cool uh I think that is all I had yeah awesome wow Round of Applause for Bindy that was uh that was incredibly informative um awesome to see uh so okay so now now we're sort of into I hope everybody is grounded in what airbit is um one of the things that's fun about doing these live streams is that we're inviting different awesome people uh to join us um but you know a lot of you may already be familiar with data stacks and asro DB because you've tuned in before but you know every every episode we've got like a new awesome person to introduce representing like a product that you might not be familiar with so I hope we're all grounded one thing um I didn't take care of earlier and I'm so sorry a little bit of housekeeping um we would love to answer all of your questions um so uh I there is a you look if you're in crowdcast many much much apologies to folks on uh you know Twitter Twitter or LinkedIn but if you're here with us in crowdcast there is a Q&A widget on the right of the screen it's a box that has a question mark in it um if there are questions that you want me or bendy to answer um please ask your questions using that feature um another uh cool fun aspect of the feature is that you all can like treat it like Hacker News or Reddit and like vote up vote up questions so if you see that someone's asked a question that you are like oh I also want to know the answer to that um you can go ahead and plus plus one uh on those questions and they'll bubble to the top so all right so let's keep the keep the train moving um so we feel great about airite it's amazing um let's use it to build this XK CD search engine um so now I am going to share my screen let's get the screen up um oh let me sorry let me let me hide this uh slide and good so that is going to go away and I'm going to go ahead and share my screen and I'm going to share I'm gonna share the whole screen I I trust you folks you're not gonna make fun of what's in my dock right um okay so all right so I've shared my screen um okay so first of all as I mentioned before uh if you've never heard of XKCD maybe the best thing coming out of this live stream for you is simply an introduction to some of the funniest stuff on the internet um I don't know how long XKCD has been being published I mean it's got to be well over a decade at this point but go to xkcd.com it's a web comic that is like built built by and built for uh Geeks and programmers um I think that you'll love it so all right so what do we need to do so if we want to create an intelligent search engine that can query you know decades worth of XKCD Comics like what are what are the tools that we need um well the first tool that we're going to talk about uh is data stacks and specifically um our Vector database called astb uh all you need to do a lot like airite um developers can sign up for ASB completely for free you just click on that trif free button uh you can you know you can sign up with GitHub or Google or just give us your uh your name and your email address and it is absolutely completely free to use uh for for developers um with a very very few limitations um so really really easy to get started with um once you uh sign up for Astro the next thing um I'd like to talk about and you know Bindy just reviewed this was was air bite right so in bindy's example he was showing us uh a sort of a she was telling us a story about uh synchronizing uh data from GitHub and pulling it into Google Sheets so great um what do we want to do well in our case we want to pull data from XKCD so Bindy mentioned that there are you know hundreds of sources uh among all of these amazing sources is the xkcd Source you can go ahead and search for XKCD you see it right here and it is probably the easiest Source in the world to configure because there's no authentication there's no API Keys it's just an open API uh so all you need to do is come here and click setup source so awesome so that's really easy for us to do uh the next thing we need to do is set up a destination so in our case we're going to set up astrab so what does it take to set up astrab well um you're going to give the destination to name um I want to spend some time talking about uh this section right here so first of all um like all destinations and sources you have documentation in this right pane that help uh help you understand like what your options are and and what's happening um but I'm going to give you the talk track so astb is a database that supports storing Vector data um so what that means in this case the data that we're getting from XKCD is going to be information about all of the comics uh which is going to include text Data such as the title of the comic uh and some some some alt some sort of description Fields as well um this processing uh section is what we need to do to actually process the text so when you're building in generative AI uh generally what you need to if you have large chunks of text that you're processing one of the first things you need to do is break that uh text up into chunks um so in this case uh so I'm going to go ahead and go back to a preconfigured destination um so I can I can describe this in more detail so in this case for the demo we've decided that we're going to break up the text that we're getting from the comic book into uh by into sort of chunks that are 512 characters long um and I'll I'll talk a little bit more about why that's necessary um as Bindy also mentioned um we uh you know we're we're able because because of what we're connecting to we're able to we're able to understand what fields are available to us so in this case uh the the API that we're accessing has certain fields that it outputs so we're going to store store the title the image and the alt text in our asdb database I'll show that to you in just a second um the second thing that's really important is we need to we need to tell uh airite what What fields do we want to use to actually create the embedding um so an embedding is uh basically the vector it's the it's the array of numbers or the vector that you get back from the llm um I'll I'll describe that in I'll describe it in the next section but we have to tell airite hey like what text fields are we using to create this embedding uh and then we can kind of ignore the text splitter this uh because we have uh because we've told it to to to chunk based on the size this is something we can ignore um so the second thing that we need to think about is oh what what service are we going to use to create the embedding um remember uh the the raw text that we're getting from the API we need to turn it into a vector embedding in this case aaby supports uh a bunch of different embedding models um and so in this case we're going to use open AI uh and we're going to uh and in order for that to work we're going to have to populate our API key for open AI which I've already done uh finally we get down to indexing so this is this is just a fantastic uh way of visualizing the different steps that your data goes through before it gets persistent Ed so finally we get to indexing this is where the uh the individual documents and the vectors that are calculated are going to be stored in ASB so the first thing it asks for is an application token um I'm going to go ahead and switch over to uh my astb so this is this is this is the the database that I've created um which I've creatively called airite uh this is my database um and here in my database I have easy access to my credentials which include my API endpoint but also my application tokens creating new application tokens is as easy as just clicking this button and then boom I've got an application token so going back to airite uh I need to tell it my application token I need to tell it my astb API endpoint which once again was right here in the in the in the right uh I have to define something called a keyspace uh for the purposes of folks who are following our tutorials are playing with it just use the the the the string default keyspace and you'll be fine uh and we have to specify collection so going back to Astra um this database uh can consist of one or more things called collections collections you can kind of think of a collection as like a table right it's a it's a bundle of similar documents so I've gone ahead and created a collection called XKCD uh and that is specified here in fact actually um I'm going to take a step back um you can you can create collections using uh the web UI you can also create collections uh using using Code you can you can use our API to create collections airite is really smart um airite will actually create this collection for me um without me doing any work so when you're going through this yourself you just give the collection a name and airite will actually create it for you so awesome so uh so we've talked about the source we've talked about the destination uh and then as Bindy mentioned now all that's left is to create this connection so this is our connection uh between XKCD and astb and I won't um I won't belabor uh sort of the demo right um you saw Bindy walk through the ability to kind of check check in on the job history check out check out like what's in the schema um this is just a fantastic place to sort of monitor this live connection that you have and of course if you need to you can resync your data uh so what I want to do now is uh actually dive into the code and show you all like what you can do after the data has been synced to after DB so I'm going to go ahead and move over to uh Visual Studio code uh I hope I've made hey Bindy is this is this text big enough can you can you see this yes yes it's was pretty good yes yeah thanks I made it as big as I could without being kind of like a comical so uh so this uh so actually I'll I'll go back to my browser very quickly um we wrote up a an awesome blog post on uh exactly everything I'm showing you right now uh in this live stream we'll share the link out later so um so don't don't worry if you're not scribbling down notes we're going to share links to the blog post and all of this code later um this is a this is a python code notebook um so I want to show you exactly what it takes um to build this rag EXP experience uh using python um for folks who don't know what rag is that just stands for um retrieval augmented generation and I'll hopefully I'll explain hopefully it'll make it'll be clear what that means after we go through this so the first thing I need to do is just pip install my uh dependencies um which include uh rag stack AI uh that's just a really convenient library that we built here at data saxs that makes it easy to to sort of uh Wrangle things um with astb and then and use Lang chain and a couple other dependencies so I've gone ahead and installed that um now uh we need to uh we need to import uh various libraries into our uh into our application and we need to load some values from the environment which I'm going to go ahead and do so um remember uh those I showed you uh those um in order to connect to Astro DB uh you have to have a bunch of secret connect secret credentials um I have stored those credentials in a EnV file so this load. end function um pulls those values into this code notebook um all right uh and and now we're going to go ahead and start initializing these variables inside our python notebook we're going to get the application token we're going to get the API endpoint um we're going to set the keyspace name and the collection name to the values um the exact same values that I set when I was configuring air air bite um we're also going to grab our open AI key and I'll explain I'll explain why we need to do that when we get there so in in here uh we're going to go ahead and initialize um this open AI embedding model and here we're going to uh connect to astb and we're going to initialize our collection so awesome so so so good so far so now we need to uh we need to Define our query so I'm going to go ahead uh this the code notebook will let you uh enter a value up here um I'm just going to stick with the default which is Kepler um this uh this is this is sort of the this this the the query part of our search engine um so now the way that rag works for folks that are not familiar um we have in fact I I want to show this to you very quickly so when we ingested all this data into astrab um it was remember we we vectorized in fact I'll show this to you in airite very briefly remember remember that we vectorized uh the title and ALT fields from the API so we took those string values concatenated them and we turn them and we and we used open AI embedding model to create these vectors so if I just look at one of them uh right here this is this is this title is called new study the alt sorry about that the alt is this text right under here uh when the results are published no one will be sure whether to report on them again uh and then this really really long uh array of values right here this is our Vector um so going back to the code notebook and and going back to the code notebook we now have to we now need to take the query that we just entered which was the word Kepler and we actually have to turn it into a vector um so uh no I don't want to do a survey so this is also so the qu the text Kepler got converted into this super long array of values and let's see if I can copy this because this is actually like a really fun demo um I apologize for how long this Vector of numbers is in fact maybe this is not worth it so I'm gonna see if there's a an easier way for me to copy this okay I can um but anyway uh this this Vector now represents uh the input that we're going to use to query astrab so now down here um using using the collection that we've initialized we're going to use uh we're going to find the closest Vector to uh to the the closest document that matches the input Vector that we're providing and we're going to pull out these three fields from our database now going back to Astra in addition to the vector uh attribute we have the title the image and the alt so going back to my code notebook I'm going to go ahead and run this and boom we uh we almost immediately get a result from astb and then I'm going to SC scroll down just a little bit more and we're going to display the result from uh from astb Vector search boom awesome so uh if all of you could uh if I could hear you I'm sure you're clapping and sharing with a like tremendous abandon um so this is this is pretty amazing um there are if I go back to astb there are like well over a thousand records in here um and the the Spectre search was able to find the exact one that we wanted um we can we can keep doing this right so I happened to search for uh you know for a web comic so the title of this web comic was Kepler I searched for Kepler like maybe that's cheating right like let's do a fuzzier search so let's go ahead and rerun this and say um I don't know like uh Bears and Lions um so there's kind of a I'm hoping that there isn't actually a web comic that's called Bears and Lions so we've gone ahead and set our query um let's go ahead and vectorize that query so there we go Bears and Lions has now been turned into a different Vector uh and then instead of finding one um Let's find let's find a bunch right like let's let's find all the documents um that potentially uh let's find the the the five documents um that most closely match Bears and Lions um let's see uh sorry me move this to the end limit equals five awesome so and let let's do that cool all right so the first one we found this is nice so like I entered Bears and Lions the first one I got back was uh a comic called cougars which I'm going to open up and I'll make it a little bit bigger uh so so I guess cougars is pretty similar to Bears and Lions uh let's see what the let's see what the next one was um sorry I'm gonna scroll over to the right all right the next one oh here we go so in in embedded in this comic is actually the word bear um and then there we go uh and then Greek for for bear I think or laat Latin for bear is ursus um okay so this is great so this this is exactly what we wanted to do right we wanted to use Vector search to perform a fuzzy query uh across uh you know thousands and thousands of documents and come back with the ones that matched uh match the closest so all right so I'm going to go ahead and hop hop out of here uh and go back to go back to the stream and stop sharing my screen so just give me one second to find find that button all right I'm back everybody um I missed you really it's really weird to be staring at all these web pages and not seeing bindy's face um so yeah so hopefully awesome yeah look I've actually never seen this so I've been at airb for two months right so I've never seen the whole process end to endend as in you know uh actually putting it into the vector database and seeing the collections in there and being able to search on it so that was actually really cool for me to see I'm so glad and I'm s and for folks on the on the stream I'm sorry that I wasn't able to um to like quickly copy that whole Vector value um in astb like in the data Explorer um you can paste vectors in in the UI and you can actually do a realtime search um against that vector and and for like when you're testing and trying to debug uh it's just a great A great experience um as you're trying to kind of see whether because look when you're building in generative AI um things don't always work that easily sometimes you have to swap different models in and out of your application or in and out of a um in order to fine-tune the results that you're getting right um so uh so that's just a really useful tool um to kind of quickly iterate and like see like if the results if you're happy with the results so um all right so uh I I'm going to I'm going to pull up uh our our awesome agenda because we are we're starting to to wind down um but we are totally going to get to your questions so I'm going to now turn my eye of zoron um to the Q&A uh and we're going to start to to run through these things and get your get your questions answered so so bnie the first one is for you um what uh does airite open source require running a database as well yeah so when you run airide open source it creates a a Docker container for you and it actually installs a postgress instance um for you to work with and so and same uh when you do it on production using kubernetes kubernetes will do that for you so there's a database involved in open source okay awesome uh let's see going to the next one um Daryl uh this is a long one let's see suppose I'm building a rag application what are some of the ways to improve the rag I'm thinking of using something like key phrase extraction and embedding only these into the vector store to decrease processing time uh is this a viable option so this is a pretty pretty informed form Med or pretty uh a pretty detailed question I'd say um I'd say the the quickest uh we should we should dig into this a little bit right so the the first question is I'm thinking of using something like key phrase extraction em and embedding only these into the vector stord to decrease processing time so what I'm hearing you say is like uh can I decrease the total amount of data that I'm uh that I'm ingesting or that I'm or that I'm sort of computing embedding score in order to decrease a processing time I mean that is certainly true right like when you're on the inest uh in the inest process uh you know depending on the source uh the source that you're getting data from um you know it's up to you like how much of that data you want to to to sort of compute embeddings for um and once again like aite offers a bunch of different options uh for what you can use to compute embeddings I mean the more the more data you try to compute embeddings for um it's possible that it may increase the amount of time it takes to run that ingestion process um yeah I'm not sure I'm not sure if you if there's anything you want to add to that Bindy um like are there any I guess I think what Daryl's asking is like are there any strategies to kind of like streamline this process and only only calc only compute embeddings for the things that matter yeah so this is something that I went to a talk before um last week uh two weeks ago and I heard from some you know there's speaker from Lang chain and he was talking talking about how you can actually maybe embed the most important pieces uh put them in the vector database but kind of have a link to the documents you know so say if you're able to receive uh the key points you're able to get to the whole context for it so you don't actually have to embed the whole document kind of like a summary of it so you know where the data is and then you can refer to the actual document so that builds yeah yeah and yeah I don't have too much more to add there I mean I think like when it's funny you know I actually really love Daryl's question because you know he's specifically really focused on the ingestion part which is which is makes sense because we've got Bindy and and airite here right um a lot of times when I hear about optimizing rag um it's usually on the the latter the postingestion part it's kind of like hey like how do I optimize like the actual results that people get when they interact with these things um uh and and some sometimes that can uh a lot of that has to a lot of that usually invol prompt engineering um but I think I think darl's question was pretty squarely like on sort of on doing inest and like doing it more more efficiently um okay oh and I should have I should have clicked on that but I didn't sorry about that darl um oh this is this is a good one this is like straightforward right um can I have one source and multiple destinations on the same connection straight straight up product question no no we can't so um you can definitely use the same source with multiple Destin ation so say I want to push data from mix panel to Big Korean Google Sheets I can do that and you can also use multiple sources with the same destination but not on the same connection you have to make different connections that's a totally yeah I but I think I think it makes sense I mean like I think it seems like it seems like so long as you can use the same source with multiple destinations it should it feels like it should achieve the same result right um so I mean because I think I mean ultimately like I I think what prash is asking is like look like if I set up a single source and then you know new data flows into the source like like I want it to you know I want it to make I want it to go to two different places so so it sounds like if you create two connections but they share a source then I think that would that would sort of work right yeah it would resolve that because if you already have a destination setup that is doing incremental loading but if you set up another destination that will make sure to sync all the data from day one yeah okay all right awesome um let's uh let's keep going um does aaby support document permission uh ACL out of the box no no I think I think I don't think so because that is a bit very complicated for us to kind of implement and so we leave it to to our customers to do that yeah makes sense and actually uh I think this next question might might help with that a little bit um wait where did it go um um well the let's see I was thinking like maybe Pi Pi airite you know could sort of be helpful because it's like hey look like that's a you know an application Level concern you know like you know use pi airite and sort of like apply like a layer of security like on top of what you get and I don't know but here um are there similar packages Pi aabby for other languages which hey but and and Bindy like I am a fullstack JavaScript developer so I'm very jealous by what I'm seeing with P aites so do you have any good news for for me uh you know a p is still in beta in Python so we don't have any plans for other languages yet but if we see enough demand for it then we'll probably definitely consider no JS okay well me me and Kevin um well well I'm asking for JavaScript I Kevin I wish I wish you I wish you had told us what you wanted because bindy's right here and she if it had been Ruby perhaps that would have tipped the scales but anyway I'm I'm kidding um I think uh airb has a has a slack is is your is the airb slack kind of open to the public is it open for folks to join yes yes and if anyone has trouble finding it just uh email me B the air. and then I can I can send you the link yeah okay awesome um all right let's keep let's keep going um are there recommended open source models for rag o that's a fantastic question um I I actually like you know I don't have like a definitive singular answer for you like my go to Resource is hugging face like when I when I when I'm trying to get my hands on an open source model um as opposed to a you know hosted service like open AI like I go to hugging face and I kind of poke around and I see see what see what they have I don't I don't know I don't know if you have any better recommendations there Bindy I know I don't actually not for this one now yeah um yeah check out hugging face um one thing I'll say is that there are I mean there are quite literally like I mean there are just dozens or hundreds of these things um from small companies and big ones right like B like meta has uh some an open source model called llama 2 like there are there are a ton of them um and I'll actually tell everyone on the stream like there's no such thing as like good versus bad really like they're just they're different they're tuned different they perform differently under different circumstances I think part of being a developer in the space is getting really good at swapping these things in and out and experimenting with them um so yeah definitely check out hugging face as a place to start um let's see oh man we just keep getting more good questions can we extract the data from GitHub to Google sheet using py right um not at the moment so Pi airb was built with you know data practitioners uh python developers and AI developers in mind so it gives you access to all of airite sources but it kind of leaves it up to you and how we interpret that data once you load it so uh for higher bite we actually have a concept of caches and right now we support duck DB big query um postgress uh Snowflake and mother duck so uh there's something that we're working on is how you can build more caches and more destinations and kind of move from one destination to another destination we don't have that yet cool awesome yeah it's in it's in it's in beta folks um it sounds like it's something they're really excited about and they're moving fast on um all right astb manages the size of the embedding Vector for different models um I I I think I think what's being asked here is like why did I why did I use the value of 512 um for the the size size of the vector um the uh well in any case um I don't I I don't want to go back to my screen um this is but this is incredibly important information for folks so when you're storing vectors in a vector database no matter what Vector database it is you need to define the dimensionality of the vectors that you're storing like in advance um like you can't store differ sized vectors um like in the same collection uh the the actual value um the answer to the question is like oh how many dimensions do I need to store that is that's based on the model that you use so when in airite when we selected open AI um what wasn't completely explicit was which of the open AI models is actually being used in that case it's uh I don't know the exact name of it but it's like the text Ada O2 model and that model um generates vectors of a certain dimensionality um so that is that is what we have to that is what we have to Define I feel like the the the the 512 value though was not the dimension of the vector though it was the size of the chunks so that's um so just to be clear with folks on the call like there's sort of two different numerical values you need to care about one is the size of the chunks um when you're uh when you're ingesting Text data and putting it into a vector database like you in the in the in the comic example it's that's that's actually not the best example try to imagine that you're ingesting like documents like really long documents you're not going to want to take entire document and turn it into a single Vector you're going to want to break it up into chunks um and then turn those chunks into vectors and this 512 was telling airite hey like how big do I want my chunks to be um as I break apart this text value the other thing is the dimensionality um in the airb interface we didn't have to define or or set the configure the dimensionality because when you select the model you're using it's it's baked into it so that's that's not something that you have to do via the airite interface if you create collections um using the UI and astb yeah um you know when you create that collection you'll have to tell us like what the dimensions are because we because the the database just doesn't know in advance um all right we have we've gone a well over time um this was just so fun I love these live streams so much Bindy it was so awesome having you and learning more about airite um I want to let everyone know uh that we're going to send an email out after this live stream uh with links to everything that we talked about so links to airite links to Astra links to this blog post links to the code notebook so don't worry we're going to get you all the resources that you need um uh definitely check out arite um definitely join their slack um if you have like certain things that you're you're asking about or want um or you sort of want to get connected to the folks and uh just thanks for joining the call Bindy thank you so much for spending some time with me uh and uh we look forward to seeing all of you on the next stream so uh bye folks bye bendy bye thank you",
