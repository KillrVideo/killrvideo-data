[Music] okay and we are live hello everyone and welcome to today's workshop just a quick sound check uh please can i ask you to give me a thumbs up if you can hear me well let's see let's and the same with me if people can hear me out there uh out there too that'd be that'd be really great yeah so good morning nitesh uh okay can i take it you can hear us let's see i don't see any so i see some thumbs up i think we can start uh sound check for aeron as well i take it as a yes so let's start okay yes that's that's good okay hi everyone welcome welcome to today's uh workshop that's actually week three and uh the summer series focused about learning and using cassandra to build your own applications which is the topic of today so maybe we are seeing your slides everyone so i would give it to you all right yeah well well welcome to uh to being able to uh you know you know to learn about um you know building out applications in in java and python and cassandra um this this is actually gonna be kind of a first where uh we're gonna try and help everyone through with uh with more than one language at a time here so um the the exercises can be attempted in either java or python once we get to that point um so so yeah um you know you've got uh we've got stefano on the on the python side and um you know i'll be i'll be running the the java side so hopefully things will go really smoothly and uh you know we'll uh we'll see how this all works out so you all get to be a part of trying something new today so there we go it's very interactive let's see okay so uh all right well stefano maybe you should introduce yourself so i'm stefano i'm stefan actually but everyone calls me stefano i live in italy i'm a developer advocate data stacks particularly interested in distributed systems and of course apache cassandra which is my favorite database ever i usually wrote in python and a bit of javascript and i used to be a physicist please these are my contacts and feel free to join me to reach me on my social networks now did i did i see that that you have a phd in theoretical physics that's true that's pretty seriously cool yeah we should start calling you dr stefano right please no that's that's okay [Laughter] all right well anyway i'm i'm aaron um i live in minnesota so in the united states but um you know i'm also a developer advocate i also do try to focus on like the um uh database reliability engineering side of things as well you know um but um you know i'm also a uh you know bit of an author i've written a couple of books on distributed databases um seven nosql databases in a week was one i worked on as well as um mastering apache cassandra 3.x um s i've spent um you know a few years as an engineering lead in um you know the the real world um and uh i spent about five years as the uh nosql engineering lead for for target um you know working on like large scale distributed systems um mainly cassandra and i also spend a bit of time on stack overflow um you know if you asked a question on um about cassandra and stack overflow odds are that i've probably helped you out um so yeah so yeah that's uh that's a little bit about me great so of course you know in addition to you know stefano and i there's a whole team of people um behind us here at uh at data stacks and uh you know developer relations you know helping us build all this content out and bring everything forward um so hey just thank you to everyone and you know you'll notice that some of them are probably online in the chat and on discord um so so yeah in other words it's more than just stefano and i yeah it's a pretty big effort to try to deliver you the best experience the best workshop so um yeah so maybe we can okay i'm very strange okay that's all good all right okay so yeah here's our agenda you know right now we're doing just a quick introduction you know we'll talk a little bit about uh microservices and um and why cassandra is a good fit for building out with microservices we'll focus a little bit more on you know like the rest api access or aspect i should say of microservices um and then we'll we'll build up towards uh towards our sensor iot application as well as a a rest api um along with that uh along with that application and from there we'll we'll kind of go into the the quiz and the homework and maybe what's next so here we go cool okay um will you [Music] just go over this slide quickly because of course your friends are waiting to do a bit of interactive quiz or questions right right yeah sorry staphon i wasn't sure if you wanted to take this one but yeah sure okay so um that's real quick practical advice to what to do with us today so first you are watching us live on youtube unless you're watching us record it because the the same uh you can watch us also later record it at the same link but basically we are going live we are live on youtube right now so um and that's one thing in case anything goes wrong with youtube which very rarely might happen uh we will give you a link to reach richards on twitch which is our fallback channel that's one thing but of course we want to we want this experience to be as interactive as possible so besides the lots of hands-on you will do later running code and doing stuff with us uh we you you can also ask us questions and that's something you can do on the on the youtube chat here on the side of your of the stream and also on discord on discord maybe i can have our friendly nightbot give you the link to join us on discord if you want that should come out in the youtube chat right now yes there it is um i personally today have been locked out of discord for some reason but i have to retrieve my password and try again so maybe you will not see me today in this card but tomorrow you will but i'm sure there are a few other uh faults from yeah discord was being tricky with me today too i had i also had to relog in so maybe there's maybe there's something bigger going on yeah but i think they unrolled some password policy change right today i don't know exactly but the most important thing for interactivity is that there will be a quiz at the end of today's workshop and you will be given a chance to win some swag and this quiz we will do with mendy.com you will see later but this mentee we will use menti also to ask you about a couple of questions before we start just to get to know you better the kind of audience we have yes so that's it and uh but that's not the end of the story because um next slide please yep there you go because uh so what what are the tools we are going to use today a good thing is that the whole workshop will never leave your browser basically so you will do everything with your browser namely we will use a database which is uh astradb we will tell you more about that later and it's you it's a database of the service so you can use it as a web service uh easily you can log in you can register create your database and start using it within two minutes or so after creating it and that's all for free and doesn't require anything else than a web browser not only that but we will use git pod gitpod is a very cool ide basically running on top of a remote machine a container that is created for you somewhere in the cloud somewhere else and you will just access it through the browser you will see it it's just an ide built after vs code basically and again nothing to install and of course the main material comes from github because we prepared a repository with everything all the instructions to also work on on today's material in a standalone way but of course today we will go through it together and there you will find code instructions and also the slide deck we are using today so um that's not the end of the story because in the next slide you will see there is something for you also to do okay now this is um so we have uh an academy which is uh okay that the academy is a full online learning website that will teach you everything you need to know about apache cassandra and surrounding technologies you will find links later uh elsewhere we have also data stacks slash dev website with a bunch of interactive courses and other useful learning material and github i mentioned that already and maybe in the next slide there should be an important point because we also uh aaron can you jump to next slide please oh sure there you go because once you once we with that we are done today with the practice and everything you will give you will be able to gain a badge of attendance a verified badge of attendance but that's not just something you get because you were here today you have to show that you did some work so we have a little homework for you that you will be able to do after staying with us today and then once you do the homework there is a google form you go there you submit your homework and we will grade it in a few days and you will you will be uh receiving your uh verified badge and with this this badge you will be able to brag about and feel better than anyone else basically it is kind of cool to see everyone um you know kind of post those and show those on linkedin so yeah yeah i want to add that if you are the collector type we have maybe 20 something badges for different courses for different workshops and there are a few folks who really are collecting them all and that's cool so because we run a lot of workshops and [Music] maybe i can ask nightbot to workshops is that right remember so we have a whole uh agenda workshops and that we run usually every week or so so if you're interested you can learn a lot about several technologies not not only cassandra but a bit of everything of course cassandra is the main focus and today is the third week of a three week episode series focused about cassandra apache cassandra so learning how it works learning how to write the proper data model with it for the first two weeks and today it's the time to write a small application using them yeah so all right so well also um you know as a part of um you know going through mentee we'll uh we'll give out some swag as well um to the winners so we'll we'll have a um you know a little bit of a quiz at the end where we'll um you know have some questions about um you know the material that we covered and you know if you're in the top three i think you uh should get a swag package so yes yeah that's right top three so now i will switch to my screen because it's time to start playing with mentee so excellent i will just ask you two questions i think too just to warm up and to have you log in to to have you connect to mendy so there should be yes so you please open a new tab or even better maybe from your phone you should go to mendy.com and enter the code you see here or maybe the code that you also see here so i'll make these yes so [Music] you can use the qr code you can use the code you see on screen or in the youtube chat so go to menti.com enter this code and then okay so i see people are starting to join that's very good uh these these are just questions to find out exactly who you are no just to know uh the kind of audience we have and maybe to try and adapt a bit the content to your preferences of course please keep this connection to maintain open because at the end of the workshop there will be the real quiz and those will be timed questions uh you have to answer fast and correct and if you are among the fastest and the correct test you will be winning some nice swag so i see uh maybe we wait until a couple of more people join let's see yeah how many do we have in right now i think we have half of our uh audience is in so okay maybe we can start all right okay so um okay so these are just questions to get to know you a bit and first question did you attend a previous episode or the two previous episodes of this series cassandra fundamentals data modeling which is the second or maybe you are just new to this series i see that i see an even split more or less so okay yeah very much uneven split that's interesting okay so well if you attended the previous one then you probably know what cassandra is you know how to work with it on the cql console you probably know a bit about how to properly do the data modeling part which is very delicate and a very important part when you design your application but i see for many people out there this is their first encounter with cassandra so uh please aaron let us try to make it as easy as possible for everyone no oh yeah no problem these episodes are more or less standalone and we will guide everyone uh quickly through the whole business of creating the the astrodb account and everything so don't worry it's not not a problem okay of course if this is your first then in today's repository you will find links to the previous episodes which you might find interesting uh and probably they will help you clear out everything in your in your mind okay so what is your language your preferred language for today uh as aaron said we are offering basically the same set of exercises both in java and python um we will try to be a bit of a quantum instructor so to speak let's exactly see how how much time we will have to do that to do the quantum part i see python beats java two to one yeah very much python folks here wow that's good yeah yeah okay ignore one bot well rox i'm sure you you know both so that's not a big note hi rocks by the way so you see there is raj in the chat who is going to help us maybe at some point very good okay so um more python than java and a fair share of new newcomers today okay thank you uh i can switch back to the slides aaron if that's okay for you and please keep these connections mainly open for later okay uh i think you can take all right here well hey um we're gonna spend oh sorry you good stefano yeah yeah sure oh all right we're gonna spend a little bit of time um just briefly covering what was um what was the focus of the the previous two sessions um and the first one being an introduction to apache cassandra um so you know for those of you who haven't used it before apache cassandra is a distributed database um its distributed nature allows it to handle a lot of big data related tasks uh quite easily um it's uh it's really good with um you know both read and write performance um although that that does tend to um you know bear in a little bit with um how you build your data model as as stefano alluded to um it's linearly scalable as well so that um you know if you have a a six node cluster and you know you're getting uh 10 000 operations a second well if you double that to a 12 node cluster you should now get 20 000 operations a second that's really what that linearly linear scalability um means um it's highly available which means it's uh peer-to-peer there's no single point of failure um so you know you can you you can lose an entire node or maybe even a couple and still be able to serve all of your data so that's really the you know kind of the cool thing with um with cassandra there um right along with that is it some you know abilities around like healing and automation you know where if you have a node down and there's a lot of rights coming in you know you have one node that'll kind of take on that responsibility and save those rights up as hints for you know when that when that machine which failed comes back so there's there's a lot of um you know things built into the fact that i mean really when you look at large-scale hardware something's always in a state of failure and that's um that's what cassandra is designed to handle um and then probably my um my favorite feature of cassandra is it's is how it's geographically aware where you can build in um you know logical or physical data centers in a um you know out in cassandra and it'll know how to work with those and how to distribute your data um as well as how to serve data specifically to your customers in different regions you know the the whole idea there is that you know when you when you have a worldwide application and maybe you have users on a mobile app you know you don't want users on their phone in london making a data call all the way over to a data center in san francisco and then waiting for that to come all the way back um you want them to be served by data that's local to them uh so that's really where that that geographical distribution comes into play and then of course too you know cassandra is um you know platform agnostic you can run it in in any cloud that you want um and vendor independent as well it's it's an open source project you know there's no one one company that uh that controls it so um so yeah that's that's cassandra in a nutshell we're not going to be working a whole lot with with cassandra's you know internals or things like that today um but it's it's good to have an understanding of that that underlying data storage architecture before we uh before we get too deep yeah all right so um session number two was about uh was about data modeling specifically you know we've we've mentioned so far that the data model um is really really key to to getting optimal performance out of uh out of a cassandra database cluster um and really that that um approach to building a good data model you know it kind of starts with that whole you know conceptual data model or building an er diagram like um like can be done with a relational database as well um as well as you know understanding like your workflow patterns and how things are going to flow um you know with the application and how it's going to work and really what that does is it lends itself to that second point here of applying a query first approach and that's ultimately how that that logical data model gets built um and then as we we start to look at that model and start to put it through put it through its paces and use it uh we realize that um you know there are optimizations that can be made that really result in refining that down into the physical model um and you know there are some simple some simple principles to uh to make that work just that you know remember that your data is um whether for sheboygan that's funny rags you know you know quick uh quick side note about sheboygan wisconsin is it's actually supposed to be the best freshwater surfing area in the united states um i'm not i'm not a surfer but uh you know i i have friends friends who did but um yeah there's a uh there's a beach on the on the south side of sheboygan where we're all the waves from lake michigan really come in pretty good and it's quite popular with surfers actually so i i digress [Laughter] anyway [Laughter] so yeah so data is both replicated and partitioned i mean we'll we'll get into a little more about about what that means as well um but essentially you know when you take that that query first modeling approach just remember that you want to store together what you want to achieve we want to retrieve together that's that's the main way to think about it and um as well as when you think about writing your data you know as how it's going to be queried you want to make sure that that those partitions aren't growing unbound um and that they're not going to get too big or that the same ones aren't going to get queried too often because that's going to lead to like hot spots in the cluster so it's really about thinking coming up with a like a data query and distribution strategy at the kind of at the same time one can cannot understate the importance of this part no for sure for sure um the good news is sorry the good news is that today uh the data model has been already done for you so even if you are new to the series today you will then be able to catch up later and just stay with us and look at the development part the application writing part so that's good and and i see in the chat um katie fox says she's supposed to do a polar bear plunge in lake michigan on new year's day um i've done that i was with a group that uh that did that every year in milwaukee and we used to go um yeah on january first go uh jump in lake michigan yeah that was uh that was a riot anyway so here's what here's what stefano and i are going to be um going to be talking about today um is application development uh with cassandra as the the back end or is the data tier um specifically we're going to focus on like what's what's shown here is like the back end or the the application tier um so we'll be taking you through writing you know java and python code that that uses the cassandra drivers um to pull data back from uh you know cassandra or in this case astrodb which is um you know datastax's uh cassandra as a service um database which of course you know if you haven't used it before you can totally use it for free so there are there are no worries around that all right and and of course you know as uh you know we've kind of been been highlighting this whole way through um you get to take your pick on whichever language you want to do the exercises in uh we've actually written out um you know code for this workshop in both um and uh and yeah once we once we get out to get pod for the the exercises portion you'll get to choose java or python or you can go back and do both um or if you're really fast you can do both at the same time you know i'm not that fast but uh you know maybe stefano is but yeah you could especially because the api will run on the two different local ports so they will not interfere with each other so you technically can keep them running at once well that's a great point yeah just all right it's for fun of course [Laughter] all right so yeah we've talked about the badge but um you know if you complete today's workshop and the homework that uh that comes with it you'll be able to to get have this badge sent to you and uh be able to you know do some do some bragging out on linkedin hey i got my you know apis and microservices badge from uh datastax developers so that's what uh that's what we're um you know shooting for today all right so hey we've done a whole bunch of introduction let's uh let's go on to um talking about microservices and uh maybe why it they work so well with with cassandra so one thing to remember uh when you're working with microservices is kind of the history and kind of how we got to this point um you know if you if you look back in like the 90s and earlier we really had you know like monolithic application systems you know um mainframes had been in use for for decades even at that point um and really it was you know the the ui the services layer the data layer they're all combined into um you know sometimes into one machine um and you know we kind of progressed through the years you know i remember too the um you know the earlier 2000s were very very like um client-server multi-tiered architecture approach um you know where you have your front and your back end your data layer you know the the mid early 2000s like 2005 really kind of saw that that service oriented architecture approach start to take shape um you know raise your hand out there if you've ever worked with with soap um yeah that was um for the time it was good but uh it was just one of those things where just there are parts of my brain that are damaged from doing so much xml but i i i digress but anyway today you know um you know we have the the microservices approach um which really offers more isolation in terms of the different layers and you know kind of how they interact with each other all right so again um you know for microservices specifically you know we're looking at uh martin fowler's book of building building microservices oh wait a minute that's sam newman's book well anyway i digress [Laughter] but remember the the whole idea is that the uh the services are you know modeled around the domain um it's it's a culture of automation i mean you really do um want to try to get away from you know a lot of um a lot of like manual steps you know especially when you might have a service layer that has you know um dozens of services on it you know working with working with and running devops on all of them can be quite tedious um so it's so yeah it's important to consider that that automation aspect um but but the idea is is that um you know to keep these individual services like as independent as possible and isolated from the other services as much as possible too um and it's really about um you know kind of how i went back to how uh cassandra is really designed you know to support environments where there are where there are hardware failures um and that's really that's really what what microservices kind of addresses as well is that um you know you might have pieces of the of the stack that that can fail but that shouldn't take down the entire service layer just because of one simple failure like that so that is that really is the uh the point that we're that we're driving at here all right so of course you know taking a micro service um architecture approach does have its advantages um you know you've got the definite uh reduced cost in terms of like you know scaling and design um reduced risk again you know i mentioned that um that whole uh resistance to failure aspect of um of the you know that type of design um increase in release speed because the cool thing about this is that you can actually release like individual parts of the service layer instead of having you know to to release like do like a monolithic service release um so it really does kind of help you be more agile on your feet in terms of being able to deploy changes and of course it helps um helps to enable visibility as well um you know where you have you know new opportunities out there for um you know security and monitoring um and everything that comes along with um observability in that sense as well um now the disadvantage though is that you know a micro services approach can be a little on the um on the complex side you know where you know we mentioned you know security visibility as a plus well security does get a little more complex because now you do have multiple endpoints where you you do kind of have to worry about uh about these things um oh we lost my audio for a bit really um stefano can you hear me okay yes i can okay oh well that's i didn't see anything weird but yeah i just saw a note from yeah should feel good okay cool thank you greg hi greg [Music] okay cool um excellent oh katie heard me too outstanding outstanding all right maybe it's just rags i don't know um you know it's important to um to note too that that taking a micro services approach um does involve like a cultural change as well you know it's it's um it's one of those things that you really do have to have everyone on your team on board with um to be successful with so that's uh that's important to note too and a bigger bigger run footprint as well um you know especially when you start getting into like the um like the serverless uh microservices approach um those of you who work in infrastructure know that you know the serverless is kind of a misnomer it still does run on a server um it still does run on many servers it's just you know how many and where they are has been kind of abstracted away from uh from the developer um so so yeah if you're working on the infrasight that uh that can lead to some challenges all right so we've talked about how microservices should be you know isolated um and they shouldn't share anything and you know really that means that you should have a database for each service um so it comes down to the question of do you do that does anyone do that and if not why um hey stefano i think this is this is a really great uh this is a really great point to make you know definitely you know highlights the the differences between you know what theory is and what what reality is you know what i mean yeah deploying a whole different data infrastructure database a different database for each service and sometimes too much it's something that not not all companies can can afford unless they have an infinite operations team behind so you you find compromises right right for sure for sure um and you know sometimes too in in terms of um in terms of cassandra you know you could even go the route of um giving each service its own key space i mean that does offer you know a certain amount of um of isolation as well when you um when you do things that way um you know i can tell you though from practical experience you know working at um when i was at target that is what we did you know when we had a team who was building out a new application or a new service layer they really did get their own cassandra cluster um but again that's because you know you look at target corporation they're they're gigantic and um they really do have the resources that can support that like uh you know dedicated you know no sql team you know dedicated folks on like the service service level um at the storage level um you know even out at the cloud level too um so it can be uh yeah yeah it really does just depend on you know how many resources you have available and i mean that's that's for sure that's for sure yeah but of course as you can also consider a compromise such as sharing the same database infrastructure between services but each service going to separate a completely separate cell in this database or key space in our case for example but in that case if you still want to keep the illusion of complete the the actual setup of complete the couple the coupling then you need a database that is not much relying on relations and triggers and not a relational database in other words so that's i think many of our attendees are starting to see where we are going aaron i think we've made the point all right um so real quick you know getting back to um one of the the core principles of cassandra um and specifically any database which is non-relational um you know how when you you work with a relational database you like oracle or postgres uh mysql mariadv etc um there's this concept of asset of um of having all of your your transactions be you know atomic and consistent and isolated and durable um in the the no sequel distributed non-relational world um that's not always read never possible so um you know there's a uh there's a different approach which um you know non-relational distributed databases tend to take and that um you know we we have this concept of of base instead of acid you know uh where it's like you know think things are basically available um with soft state eventual consistency um and and really what that means is that um you know when when you build any large-scale distributed system there are compromises to be made and one of those compromises is in um ensuring um strong consistency in place of um or sorry sacrificing strong consistency for performance and for availability um for always being able to give a result set instead of an error message um that's really what uh what what base is about um so yeah that's uh and that again that kind of lends itself you know um to um you know when you look at cap theorem you know where you have consistency um high availability and partition tolerance well cassandra ends up being more of an ap system which really does allow for like you know item potent type of uh operations and uh you know can definitely can definitely keep thing keep things going in the sense of um you know again when you have those failures um you'll always get a response back or you'll always be able to perform a write so that that's really the the whole idea behind it all right you know so continuing down that path you know the idea is that um you know our our data layer is like like loosely coupled um you know where we have data that that's replicated on multiple nodes uh we have load balancing that happens but that actually happens at the driver's side um the the cassandra drivers themselves actually have like what's called a load balancing policy um where it figures out um query routing on the client side so it kind of knows which nodes ahead of time it has to talk to um it also does things like um you know health checks on the driver's side um and i already did mention a little bit about that uh that hinted handoff aspect of cassandra database as well too where if there's a node down that's responsible for a certain like range or partition of data and you have a write that happens um it makes sure that that data doesn't get lost even though the node that it's supposed to host it is down so essentially it creates it as hints on on other nodes and that's how um you know things get um things eventually get reconciled once it once it comes back up um but again you know we want to make sure that um that we're going with that shared nothing idea um you know on like a per key space level or per table level um even for for profile with um you know like your your role based access controls um so so yeah you'll have um oh shelly asks a good question how does it know which node to hit well actually what it does is when you build your table and we'll show this in a little bit but um it's um it takes the partition key and actually hashes that into a a token and each node is responsible for a range of tokens so based on that token that hash token value the driver knows which node has to be contacted for the data so that's a really great question so not only is the driver aware of which node has the data you need but even if it even if you hit any other node that would internally be able to coordinate the query within the cluster and get your data back that's right that's a double layer of insurance for you all right i kind of jumped to the uh the the first hands-on slide a little too early there that's great that's okay but um i think it's good time to move to the first part of the practice which is creating or resuming your database so let me start by giving you a link in in the chat okay so here is the first quantum split of today because we we have seen at least one third of you are new to cassandra new to astrodb so um we will assume you don't even have any astra db instance yet ready to use later so the rest of you have already created it in the previous weeks so i will try to show you both how you will do from here so first if you are new to astra you should go to the link i posted and register for it and that's just uh you can sign in with git github or google or username password and it's a very short signup process completely free nothing nothing asked just sign in and once you get in you will be able to create your database for to you to start using it in a couple of minutes everyone else that is those of you who already created your database in the previous weeks stay with me because now i'm going to show my screen for yes so this is the sign actually this is the sign in page of astrodb which is a version of basically it is a database offered as a service in the cloud and it's built on cassandra but it's let's say cassandra minus all of the operations and maintenance and management burden so let me login of course i already do have an account i should go okay so whether you uh already do have an account and logged in or you just signed up i'm going a bit slow or uh whoever wants to sign up now this is your dashboard when you are logged in so there are many things that can happen here stay with me first let's say you created your database last week to play with data modeling then probably your database which is going to be called workshops unless you did something strange your database would show up as this little brown dot like my dsdb here and you will see it is hibernated you see here maybe i think you can see or maybe i can switch to my uh fancy damn screen with ourselves made a bit smaller to leave room for you know interesting stuff let's say so your database might be hibernated and you will also get this kind of notice then if you click to if you click this button resume database or maybe you can also click it here by click so you go to the dashboard for your database and you can resume database if you click here in a couple of minutes your database will be re hydrated resumed and ready to be used that's something of course that only happens from for the free tier because it's a free tier anyway the other option is that your database is green already which means active as it is the case sorry as is the case here for my other database like this one here my company you see active databases too my company is active that means it's ready to be used from right now but if you just arrived and you just created your astra account then what you have to do is to create a database and that you can do maybe i'll show it again very quickly that you can do with this button create database or even this create serverless database here so if you go to create a database and this is only for of course for those who haven't created the database in previous weeks you can create it by just calling it workshops by giving the key space name of sensor data if i'm not mistaken but i'm going to check because it's a good excuse to show you the readme in the repo where all these instructions are listed in particular we are in the prerequisites of course so you need the database you need to have follow the previous weeks let's say you need a crea to have created your raster b instance this is the button to go and create it in case you haven't database name workshops and key space sensor data i don't mention that but a key space is more than just a grouping of tables for but for us today it is a logical group where we store all the all tables related tables together let's say for the whole set of tables needed by an application for example okay so database name key space name then select the provider and region i suggest to stick with google cloud because in the free tier that's the one most okay oh yeah sorry stefano i think i got ahead of you a little bit there yes i yes sure because i'm showing your screen i wasn't sure if that was intentional or not but yeah i did my best to follow along with you you did great thank you yes um okay so uh are you going to continue then and i thank you for that or oh no that's cool that's cool okay so um so do i switch to mine again well at this point you can continue creating the database because you did which is i'm grateful to you indeed because i messed up with creating the database so okay that's all right oh hey mine's active now actually while uh aaron created his database in the meantime he gets this nice token information which is hidden but actually can be copied and i suggest so in in any case i'm going to create mine as well so region stick with google cloud and stay with any region that is available no with without the lock icon the padlock icon okay so maybe i switch to mine so i can then go on yeah yeah that's that's a good idea so we are back to my screen and i'm creating my database as well looks like yes so this has is being created and while it is provisioned as aaron was showing you see there is on the on the right i see this pending token generated and in the meantime here i can see my token now you wonder what is a token of course this is a very important piece of information because it will later be used as connection credentials because this database is in the cloud and of course to be able to connect to it you need some authentication methods and this is the token you see the token is made by three parts in particular the first two are client id and client secret i'm going to copy it to my reliable notepad here uh for let's say in real life you will probably save it to somewhere safe but i'm just keeping it here and in the meantime the database is going to be finalized okay so [Music] either because you already had the database and maybe you had to wake it up or because you created the database let's say you all have your database there waiting for you active go to database here and you have your token your credentials ready to be used here or somewhere you downloaded the csv or maybe a json okay just in case you already have a workshop database but you don't have a key space called sensor data don't forget there is this add key space button here on the right so you can add the key space sensor data and then you call save and that would be then created in a matter of seconds okay so let's head back to the repo and maybe let's give everyone a little time to make sure everyone is up and running with uh ready with a database and the token information can you give me a thumbs up in the chat if you are if you have an active database and the token information please yeah and i hope eunice made it through okay she uh she indicated that um um it was asking her to pay so i i asked her to double check that she was picking gcp i'm pretty sure gcp should um yeah still getting stuck on database created i have to pay yeah really for the free tier gcp has a bunch of regions where you can just create the database and go ahead yeah that's a good point it might be dependent on the region i'm sure that belgium in europe for example is can be accessed immediately no questions asked yes so i see a question how to get the token and that's also something i would like to show so let me go back to astra db again let's say you created your database last week or one minute ago and for some reason you don't have the token no problem you can create a new token and to do that the best way is you go to your main astra dashboard like this you see your database is listed here active databases now it's three for you probably it's going to be one but no problem you see these workshops this is the one we just created you go to the far right and there is this nice dot button which contains generate a token then if you click to generate a token we can create manually let's say a token because every time you create a new database it comes with a specific token made for you ready to be used but in any case you lost it or whatever you or you need a token with different permissions you can generate a token like this and to do that for today we need to select the token with the powers of database administrator here you see database admin choose this role here and generate the token and that's it so to anyone who hasn't token yet this is the way to go you start from the database and generate token to it um now the token is displayed in a different way you see client id client secret and token proper just uh if you click on this um notepad icon you can copy it and just for completeness i will do that of course you can also download as a file here as a csv in this case but that's not something i need today but anyway this is let's say let's call it second token i know so client id client secret and token proper let's say anyway i will use the first one no big difference okay so this is how you get the token in all cases the github ripple link uh yes that should come in oh yeah sorry rux i didn't see you you put it already okay so um and by this point if you have your database and your token ready to use uh we are done with the prerequisite part we just need to start the ide i was uh breaking i think we need to secure bundle too yes right okay so first let's get the secure bundle good point yeah okay uh that's because that will be shown later but in order to for sorry let me let me go back to my main astra dashboard for the drivers to connect to your database you not only you don't only need a user and password which is basically secret id and token id and token secret but you also need something called the secure bundle which is a small zip file containing routing information and certificates to make it easier to just reach the right whatever inside the astrodb and uh go through the the proper proxy system and reach exactly your database and to do that i'll go to my workshops database here so now i am in the dashboard of my workshops database you can click to this connect tab here below workshops so there are a few tabs and now i'm going to the connect tab here which contains a bunch of possible explanations and instructions to connect to the database in several very many ways now we go to connect using a driver here and you can choose any language for example python if you click to this python you will see a big blue button download bundle here and you can download the bundle that's about the 12 kilobyte file which i just downloaded and i can keep it there for later now this is a zip file but if you don't need to open it you just keep it as a zip file and then you we will use it later as it is it's a task for the drivers to open and look what's inside okay so let me show that again because that's very important how to get the bundle the zip file because we will need it in a second uh go to your database workshops click on it here then locate this connect tab here because we are going to connect so it makes sense in particular there is this listing on the left connect using a driver is our target and you choose any language here node whatever then finally there is a blue download bundle button here and if you click on it you will be able to connect to download this bundle okay and that's the the whole thing now there's a question about golang which i leave to aaron in the chat maybe yeah you know that's i saw that too um we are actually working on a uh on a go sdk but um we we don't have an official one for um you know it's available through astr right now um i can tell you there is a go cql driver out there which is um community maintained but it works really really well and uh oh verage s and chat you know which language are we following for this session um you can actually pick either java or python um either one we have exercises for both oh yep yeah stefano you saw that one you beat me to it okay so it's important that we at this point all of you have a database a token and this file the zip file the bundle ready to use because now you are all going to create your own id your own service to to start running the code and that's going to happen in in the in a container offered to you by gitpod to do that please head to uh head to the readme which i post again because it's never too much please open the readme on github here and locate this step one there is you see there is this big button open in git put now i suggest you to right click and open in new tab or whatever just to keep the readme also available so if you open this link in new tab something magic happens so probably you have to um authenticate with github let me show you what i have to do so you have to authorize uh gitpod to access your github profile that's just a way to login and now what's happening and that's happening for all of you a container is started somewhere in the cloud on top of it which is basically a linux box ready for you to use and on top of it an online ide is started and this is it you see now uh what i have in front of me and maybe i can try making it a bit bigger what i have in front of me and you should probably also have is an ide in the browser not only that but the repository has been cloned for you you see there is the full repository here and there will be code that we are going to inspect and we are going to run how is this id structure on the left we have file browser you see this vertical box here on the top we have um file editor which is also useful for previewing but i'm going to close as much as i can so this will be my file editor and the bottom part is in this case oh there is a debug console which i want to make collapsed i have two separate consoles one says ready to rock and one says ready to curl this is just our choice and that's because when we will be later running a shell sorry an api we are going to also send some requests to it but for the moment let me make the curl shell very small and let me focus on the main console here so you see it's a linux box and you can run commands as usual okay so um the next step is we have to give the secrets to this machine because later we are going to connect to to cassandra to astral db from here so let me go and locate the bundle i just downloaded uh that should be here so i'm busy doing the same trying to find mine yeah that's tricky you have to open whatever your file browser in your local machine is you pick this bundle the zip file that you just downloaded and look i'm just dropping it here on the left and that's it so ignore the fact that git pod editor is trying to open the zip don't worry but the point is that here my file has been uploaded to this remote editor it's remote id you see secure connect workshop zip that's one thing uh as instructed by the readme that's not the end of it because we also have to provide the secrets the token information and to do that you see oh sorry you see that there is a dot m file here which is basically a template to create my my actual dot m okay so this is all explained here now we have to copy this template into an actual time file let me do that here and then it's a command that i can run in this console cpm sample into the file the temp and then we ask the editor to open it and there we there we go now uh we have four things four variables defined here the first two are client id and client secret the ones found in the token so these are going to work as credentials to authenticate with the database with your own astra db so this will be different from you for you of course so you put client id and client secret here and here and that's it then astrodb secure bundle path that's probably good already as it is unless you give you gave the database a funny name but just for to check you might just want to run this ls command and see if the output matches so that's a great idea um because that specific problem has has bit me at least twice while i've been testing this yeah maybe with another database or whatever certain things yeah so that should be correct but just in case you can make sure but anyway this should be the absolute path to your bundle file and then the key space you probably have nothing to do because unless you went creative with name in your key state so this is now my time file and that's so good now an important step is simply to source it so source dot end okay now the environment variables have been injected and the application any application later will be able to pick them up and use them to connect the database right now i'm sure every one of you who went through the previous workshops the one about data modeling in particular they already have everything tables data in the tables everything for the example we are going to use today but let's say well some of you are new and maybe some of you messed up or you played with different columns or whatever so i'll show you how you reset your database and your tables to have the right setup to start running the applications so one thing is we can quickly jump to the sql console here so i'm again to the in the astra dashboard for my database workshops i can jump to the sql console which is one of the tabs and that's a very handy tool because it's a again in the browser but it's a console using the sql language that makes it possible to just run commands onto the database using the cql cassandra query language so again all instructions should be here and it's very simple actually first i have to use sensor data then i have to test tables well in my case what tables are there i just created the full the whole database so this is empty but let's say you have some tables that you want to delete you should do a drop table table name whatever of course in my case that won't work but that's how you reset everything if you want to get aligned and do the and work with the the correct structure let's say now uh of course today is not about cql too much it's not about modeling the data so all we ask you is if you want to just reset your database click on this initialize sql that's a big file with a bunch of sql instructions you can blindly copy everything of this file and simply paste it here and watch the show magically a lot of things happen actually uh well i'm going to i'm going to quickly show you what happens uh we have tables now and tables contain there we go yeah everything so this is just in case you know a rescue button to align to get everyone aligned and get ready to do today's exercises so let me go back to the readme repo okay we are done with the setup so database created secrets and bundle ready to use then we open gitpod because that's a useful playground to run stuff that's going to be our id and file for the secrets to be later picked up by the application and file for the secrets and then everything goes to um everything goes sourced ready to be used as an environment variables and just for the sake of it we have gone to the cql console we have reset everything deleted dropped all tables in case they were funny or whatever if you feel like doing that and then just by running this giant script into the cql console you get the right table with the right shape and everything is populated so ready to go with the next steps okay in the i think i can stop here and jump back to you aaron for uh the part that comes if that's okay yeah yeah i think that's good um you know i know that uh that someone was asking if we could go over the cql console steps again um but uh but really the the simple part there is that um you know if you're on your database and you click on the um on the connect tab or sorry the cql tab it'll take you to that that cql shell interface um and then i posted a link to that initialize cql file um oh fiji got it working excellent um if you if you open up that file like like stefano did that gives you um the table structure and the the inserts for the data to um to get everything in your key space uh you know on the on the right so of course we are not going into the details of why and how you create the tables like they are this is this would be bringing us too far for because today we want to see code running uh that is the topic subject of previous week so you are strongly encouraged to just stay with us and later go and have a look at week two to have a better idea of how you do what you do and why otherwise we will not finish today on time i think uh that's that's a good point stefano yeah yeah we uh maybe we'll speed up just a little bit here [Laughter] all right i don't want to go too fast i don't want to lose anyone but uh but let's let's shift gears back to um you know the rest the rest api because we are going to um build out a rest api today that is that is that is the goal all right so you know when we're talking about um apis and um you know and building them into a service layer there are several that uh out there that you can use you know one is um grpc which is google's remote procedure call um that actually is gaining some popularity there's more and more folks using it today um you can actually use that with um with cassandra as well um but yeah basically it's um there's a little bit to set up in terms of like you know the protobuf files and whatever um but um it is very very high performing so um grpc is is something to um you know to consider on the other hand if um you're more concerned with um you know like a convenient way to access an abstract a number of different data sources uh graphql is is another very popular way to um you know to pull your data back um and and basically you know graphql is is it's just simple the like the steps here are basically just like you describe your data and you say you just ask it to give it to give you what you need and it um it comes back and the cool thing is that it's not very it's not overly verbose and that you can have like precise payloads um so graphql is actually pretty cool um and then of course you know we're talking about rest which is what we're going to um to work on today um and essentially you know restful services are ones that are you know are are built out with their their urls in a certain pattern and there are different um different like base commands that um you know are operations that that are with each endpoint like you know doing a get or a post or a put and also listed here are like patch and delete although those are you know not um you know not some of the more common ones but but that's okay and essentially what you're doing is you know it's it's um you know a more like um i almost want to say like an idiomatic way of of uh working with a uh you know like um you know working with your data and um you know hitting specific endpoints and parameterizing you know your data in terms of um you know what you're giving it and what you're getting back um so rest is is what we're going to go with today now there are some some positives for rest of course um and that um you know you're you're kind of you're you're decoupling that client and server you know so you're getting your your schema on on a read you're not really concerned with um you know hard schema requirements there's also you know the the life cycle of a um of a rest api you know that if that if you update it and um you already have you know like tenants or clients or customers out there that are expecting that endpoint to behave and be structured in a certain way you can just create a new version of it and um have your newer tenants actually hit that version number two or version three or whatever it is you you happen to be on um there's a lot of tooling out there for uh for rest as well oh shelly no we're not gonna use stargate today uh but stargate is pretty seriously cool that um yeah that that is that is our our way to um one of the ways we have to um yeah interface with uh with astra but oh that's a great question though stargate is awesome yeah anyway so the thing about rest though is that um you know the um the payloads do get a little verbose um there's no um like natural discoverability you know that's something you have to kind of build in if you're using like um like open api to generate a swagger spec um it it can be tough with like command like functions um doesn't lend itself easily to that but um you know on the flip side of that it's a crud superstar so if you're working with a database and you're doing you know a lot of those create read update delete type of operations uh rust is really really good for that as you'll as i hope you'll see um you know as as uh you know well as the you know like like oltp based you know mutation operations as well um it's good for you know public web apis um and it really lends itself toward the um toward the microservice principle of like having a focused business scope for uh for what you're trying to do making it easy to build that in so all right rest is not going away anytime soon let's say to sum it up so now that we've talked a little about rest let's go into our sensor application that we're going to build um so again you know i kind of mentioned that um you know before that this is what it looks like when you're when you're conceptualizing building out a um an application on top of cassandra or astrodb you know where you have your front end you have your back end you have your database layer um today our ui um is going to be the command line but uh but that's okay because we're really going to build out a lot of cool things into the uh into the back end and the in the application tier for sure um uh so so yeah you know again as we've mentioned you'll you'll get to you'll get to choose your own adventure here so to speak you'll get to pick hey i want to go down the java path or hey it looks like most most of you are going to want to go down the python path um so that's how how we're going to structure this going forward all right but um as far as our drivers go um you know we we actually have a lot out there and and yes i know it's been brought to our attention that yeah we don't have we don't have an official go driver but um like i said the go cql driver is out there in the community and it's it's pretty good i've used it quite a bit but um you know likewise though you know we at data stacks we offer drivers for cassandra for you know c c plus plus c sharp ruby um there's a there's a odbc one there's no node.js one and of course you know python and java um you know and and you know like i said too plenty of like um of um like community driven drivers as well like i know there's one out there for rust as well if um you know you're one of the people who's uh you know trying to uh do more thrust you know there's definitely a driver out there for that as well um but again you know the drivers really what they do is they just help you provide that that basic connectivity um you know some basic functionality around um like health checks helping you authorize and authenticate um helping you reconnect when you need to um and you also get things like um you know building out uh building up your your cql statements you know if you want you can use like a query builder or orm you know many of these drivers do offer that um yeah and oh and of course they also they also offer um things like paging like if you're pulling back a really really big data set it'll um it'll try to do it a quote unquote page at a time so as not to not to overwhelm the cluster all right so depending on what language you're using you know i know that we're also showing um you know dependency managers like uh like like um you know nuget and npm here for javascript and c sharp um but uh with what we've built today you know you'll be using you know maven on the java side for uh you know pulling down the uh the java driver um as well as uh pip on the python side for uh for accomplishing the same thing now the thing is is that um you know when you when you build out your connection um oh look at that vj got it to connect already outstanding yes he won [Laughter] that's great oh not vj viraj barrage that's right my bad my bad um anyway but uh you know as far as far as the slide goes you know when you're connecting to a cluster um if it's apache cassandra you really only need the ip of one node and your driver will do discovery on on the rest um yeah i i know git pod is an ide it's super cool i i yeah i agree it's it's awesome yeah anyway um but you know like like um like the slide says it's a good idea to offer a few um endpoints just to have that resilience in case that one node you want to connect to happens to be down but um but yeah really you only need one contact point or one ip and it'll find the rest of the cluster yeah that's because in cassandra all nodes constantly speak to each other and keep each other updated on the health status and who's there thanks to a gossip mechanism so you don't need to give more than a handful of ips for the machines and the rest is self-discovered that's cool yep that's right that's right all right so um as far as connecting goes um i know that we've had some questions around um oh hey are we are we connecting here and i remember i responded to someone in the chat saying oh no we're just we're just getting the um the environment ready but this is actually how you would um connect up in um in all four of these languages and i i you know even though we're only working with um java and python today i love the fact that we're showing how to do this in four different languages here because it allows you to see um just how similar it is in all four of these um it really it really is the a very very similar approach um the methods and um you know kind of um you know in some cases here the the fluent way to to build these things out is is very very similar across all but um you know we're basically you're just you're giving it an end point you're telling it what key space you want um your local data center name and then your credentials and that's it that's it all right um so now with astra it's a little bit different um the cool thing is that um that secure bundle that stefano had you download uh will go ahead and take care of things like um you know the the endpoint that you're going to connect on as well as the ssl certificates to connect to your specific um aster cluster so that's um that's definitely all a part of that and then he also mentioned too about um how the client id is the username and how the client secret is the password um and that's really how um you know you're going to talk to um use those to talk to astra today based on on those entries that are in that that dot env file all right um so again here's that um that's that connection code uh from an asterisk standpoint where you know you're seeing that the the path to the secure bundle is specified um and then also you know passing along like um that key space name and then you know the username and password which are really that that client id and secret i i see more and more enthusiasm by virage for gitpod who self-discovers open ports by the way there is an interesting question about how are we parallelizing the queries i think that means with the drivers well today we are going to see a basic usage but these drivers have synchronous asynchronous reactive ways to use and they also some extent they can be internally handling parallelization if i'm not mistaken so plus you can write your own layer to parallelize queries depending on your data model and whether it pays off or not of course right right um you know this slide brings up a good point about um you know how you handle the connection out to your cluster um and this goes for both um aster and cassandra and that you want that um you know you want that connection object or that session object um to be created once and then use for the entire life of the application and then destroy it at the end when you're done um so that's uh that that's actually very very important um you know if you're depending on which language you're using you know you'll want to create that session object as like a um as like a singleton um again making sure it only gets created just once um and it's it's not something that it's not like you um have a connection and you're you know opening it running a query and then killing it and disposing of it and then doing that process all over again you'll want that connection to stay up for the life of the application so that's that's important to note okay um so now we're gonna get a little bit into um the cql queries here um you'll see up here i've got uh some code in both uh python and java that essentially takes a cql select and uh is going is trying to pull data back from that um that sensors by network table for a specific network um and you'll notice we're doing this and we're kind of building the um the strings together here um and this is just um you know a quick way you can use that session.execute in both cases um to go ahead and um and put together like a like just a quick query to uh to go ahead and run um and for one of our examples today we actually are going to um are going to do this um but the real way that that ah shelly that's a great question yes network is the primary key you should ask for which table so ah sorry in in the in the slide in the slide yeah yeah that sensor is by network yes um anyway i was just going to say we're looking at the python example here but really in instead of um doing like a string builder for your um your cql queries you really should use prepared statements and um you know there are there are some advantages that that go with doing that for sure um [Music] one thing that um oh and of course here's the you know kind of the same approach but um you know doing that with java as well and and the main difference between python and java here um and yes session should be a singleton anyway um the main difference i i just wanted to point out between python and java is just that you know there's that extra step of um creating a bound statement here that um to bind the variables to the prepared statement before you execute it although there are ways to shorten this up too so like i said there's advantages to to using prepared statements um essentially you're saving cassandra from having to parse your query every single time so it's like you parse once and it gets stored in the um prepared statement cache and you can run it many times essentially what that does is it saves multiple network trips back and forth for like you know metadata around um you know the query and the result set and some other types of things these prepared statements will allow you to do like client-side type validation you know to make sure that your parameters which are integers are getting sent as integers and your parameters that are sent you're getting sent as um like strings are getting actually getting sent as strings and the cool thing too is that you know statements that bind specifically on partition keys can actually compute their own routing which is important to um you know running things in a high performance manner in that um you know your driver will know exactly which which node to uh send the query to all right with that we are on uh hands-on part number two here great so i'll jump to my screen and this time i'll try to monitor yes there we go okay so part two this is where we run code so get ready um okay so um i see there are a few questions i think on the java side of handling sessions which i will just leave to aaron maybe in the chat yeah yeah okay so let's let's see what is on the on the readme because you are now at the bottom of the readme if you are following with me and then you have to choose your path either python or java now i will start with python because that's what looks like to be the majority of uh attendees of you so i will start with python and i will try to explain uh the important parts of what's going on in light of what aaron just showed of the drivers but even you java folks pay attention because most of the concepts are the same and the code is almost a one-to-one line-by-line translation that's exactly as aaron remarked when looking at the session creation the code the usage is very similar especially as long as we write as we run the very first simple exercises so let me go to the python part of the of the readme and we will start by running small application standalone command line applications first you remember last thing we did was to source the m file now i hope you can see maybe i can try to make it a bit bigger but too much then it scrambles up the interface so we'll see okay so first thing cd python what is here in the python directory of the repo there are a bunch of python files but there is also a requirement files so if you run pip install minus r requirements which is uh standard practice in type for python folks this is just needed to install well let's look at the file why not this is needed to install very important cassandra driver in its latest version and also a bunch of other things that we will need later to run the api because to run the api ta-da we will use fast api but at the moment the only thing we are using is cassandra driver okay so we have the requirements we have installed the dependencies and we can just theoretically run things but before doing that i want to quickly show since you are fresh of what aaron said we i want to quickly show the most important file in this python directory which is db connection this is a utility module that just offers the function get session this gets session takes care of reading the environment variables using them you see using them in the cluster creation part which just follows what aaron showed in the slides and from the cluster so it creates a cluster from the cassandra drivers from the cluster it creates a session which is a cluster connected and specifying also the key space and then just returns it so these uh get session will be used elsewhere in the code to just have a session ready open and speak into your astra db or your cassandra in other cases now the trick what aaron said is you should not just keep creating sessions here and there because they they are heavy objects they consume resources and creating a session involves an initial negotiation that means a bit of time so that's why we have a rudimental rudimentary form of a singleton here so i have a global cache and the first time get session is created this is actually created and the next time we will just return a cached session so we ensure that there will be only one session for the whole duration of the whole process which is the good thing to do and then we also register a shutdown hook here to make sure to cleanly close the resource that's more or less everything in db connection and by the way this db connection will be used by the standalone command line scripts and the api alike because that's the same thing okay so much uh for showing you how db session works and let's use it and the very first exercise will be running this x00 connectivity uh let's first run it because why not then we look at what how it is done python x00 connectivity okay so it worked you see okay to run it you just python name of the script and what does this do this just let's look at the code now this is just getting the session running a simple cql query from uh there's a system table containing uh names such as the name of the cluster and the data center and so on indeed this is what we are reading with a select from the system local special table and so rows is a result set which is the kind of the data type returned by running session.execute as aaron was showing in the slides so we just give a string containing a valid cql command we call session execute and then uh with the one method you can just select the first row returned by this query which is the only one that should be the only one we are interested interested in now so if this exists then we just access the various columns of this row by the standard member name syntax and this is what we are you are seeing printed right so connected to cluster cndb at data center blah blah blah now it's interesting that you see the session is created and closed as uh instructed in the db connection singleton kind of implementation that will be clearer when the api runs but if you got to see this message then your connection works you are speaking to your database and you are getting data back with a simple query that's great isn't it okay yes it is yes it is okay is anyone has anyone been able to run the same up to seeing this result can you give me some thumbs up if you managed to see these output or something similar maybe with a different data center probably because i'm in europe is anyone okay yes same thing with java yes yes yes i'm very happy okay so it works and then you are you have been using the data sex driver to speak to cassandra that's great or to ask rdb more properly file not found that's strange [Music] that's strange maybe something with the bundle because that looks like a temporary directory the drivers unzips the bundle to i don't know what do you think yeah that's a huh okay yeah that sounds like a bundle unzip thing because there's a point where the bundle creates temporary directory and maybe some weird permission issue with your git but for some reason might be the trick or no i i think i know what might have been maybe your bundle is an is a incomplete zip file for for some reason you might want to try re-downloading the bundle and re-uploading it to the same location on git pod especially if it's less than 12 kilobytes then it might mean that the bundle is somehow incomplete for some reason maybe you downloaded it partially or whatever that might be but otherwise we will come to that later maybe you can reach on this code okay so let me move to the next exercise so this is uh this is an exercise still a python script standalone but again i'm tempted to first run it and i will do it so python x01 query q3 so this is running q3 query which is the one to get all sensors in a given network and you see this is actually what happens it will open the session run a query and print the results one by one so it gets back three lines because of the data we have populated the tables with and it will just print all details of this uh of these three rows now i didn't spend time showing you the data modeling example uh all of these scripts are based on we well very quickly it is a network of sensors collecting temperature measurements and this link is in the in the in in the github repo um of course this was subject of the data modeling but the important thing is that there are queries in particular q3 is tell me all sensors in a given network and as you as a shell remarked you need the network name as a partition key to get the sensor in that particular network so let's try giving it another so python no no volcano net okay no net should be one of the networks that exist and this has two sensors great so it all works now the code the code does something not so different from the previous one it gets the session it decides what is the network to use and then you see it is just running session execute and then a big string with a sql query look here there is a placeholder and then the second argument to execute is tuple with just this one argument matching the the placeholder here and then if you iterate over rows you are able to read its columns its fields sensor latitude longitude including characteristics which if you look at the data model is a column of type map from text to text so it's a it's a dictionary instead you can browse it as a dictionary and inspect every individual property like accuracy high sensitivity medium this is all contained into here characteristics and this happens row by row but you know what this is not the ideal way to run such a statement because you just heard about prepared statements this is not every time this is executed this is parsed again and a bunch of metadata about types and schema have to be exchanged back and forth to the database that's why we have x1b which does the same but in a prepare statement way so just to compare first let me run it but don't expect any different outcome b q three no zero one b sorry zero one b okay same output but done the right way so you see this is a q3 statement is a prepare statement again session prepare will get a statement with the question mark for the placeholder that's just there ready to be executed as many times as you want indeed this is one of those times session execute a pass this prepare statement and then just the the value of the placeholder so i'm binding the network name to this question mark and this is executed faster and it can be executed multiple times with minimal overhead the rest is the same as the basic execution so that's it for uh that's it for the standalone scripts um do we have time to do the javaheim raid um i don't think so yeah okay so uh yeah if anyone has questions on java feel free to you know drop them in the chat and i'll help you out or um you know send them along in the put them in discord as well too and we can just to show if you go to the java path it's really the same there is a different way to well you have to build compile and run and you should be getting the very same results yeah and the code is very similar except all three scripts are packed into a single main class for simplicity and it's just a matter of providing a different uh command line parameter to choose what action to take yeah that's right yes so maybe i'll suspend here and give it back to you for the last part before we come back to running the actual api yeah this should be pretty quick actually so there you go all right so um now let's take a look at our our sensor application and um and give it the ability to uh to serve out queries in a restful manner or serve out restful endpoints i should say so um essentially the way that we're we're going to accomplish that um as far as you know like which language goes um you know obviously we're using the um oh uh there's no shutdown connection i i thought there was um it should be in like um oh it's in like what like the finalize method i think i'd i'd have to i'd have to look but uh anyway but but there there should be a shutdown in there um anyway i digress um if you're um you know running running the java side will be um using uh spring boot uh mvc here um as well as the uh as well as the drivers on the back end oh and it looks like nitesh got his uh his bundle figured out so that's good that's good to hear right and then um you know as well on um for python on the back end what we're going to use is fast api um as well as the uh the python driver to uh to kind of build kind of build all this out here all right so you know the places to kind of see how we how we handle a lot of this um you know if you you look at the the python code you know you'll you'll notice that um stefano has everything laid out in that api.pi um and then the the db connection pi is where you know the connection to aster happens and then likewise um i have the um sensor network spring app in java defined as the um as the spring boot controller and then it uses the cassandra connection class and actually i think i have a um um an astra connection that also like extends out that cassandra connection object as well um but and essentially it sits on top of the driver java drivers and uh and performs the uh performs the same thing um i think the next slide here oh yeah okay so we we have our sensor api and really we're just gonna have two simple endpoints where we want to retrieve sensor data by network or where we want to retrieve specific measurements for a sensor by date and the way that we've architected this is um the first one of retrieving sensor data by network is going to be a simple get of just doing a get on sensors by network and then passing along that network as a parameter for the for the next one though measurements by sensor date uh we're using it as a post and as you can see underneath here you know we have the um the sensor id and the date passed along as uh as as um like the like the body payload essentially um and of course that brings up the question you know if when you when you have folks who work with um you know rest apis a lot you know you'll you'll it'll bring up this discussion of what's the restful way to do it um you know and why would why would getting data be a post well basically we wanted to be able to show how to go ahead and pull data back by sending that body payload along um so that's that's really the idea behind this um and you know as we discussed this stefano brought up a great point of like well what if you have like like multiple parameters for your query and you know that that url could get a little long so sometimes being able to send that as a uh a body payload um can be advantageous which would rule out uh doing a get because right has no exactly well accepted notion of body so that's a bit of a trick and this is not strain off the path of restfulness because restful is a broad specification it doesn't mean get to get data necessarily but this is not necessary even though exactly this point itself is a bit controversial there are various levels of acceptance of the rest specifications so there's a bit of philosophy going on here but let's go back to earth and run some code yeah it's a funny discussion you hear in now you hear it now and then uh what is the restful way it is not restful this is anyway okay um so all these will be clearer as i'm showing you the code doing that so uh can i jump yes yep okay i i think you can take it over for our last hands-on here get ready third part of the hands-on now we are going to run the api uh in the meantime i found out how to make the more room for the code so by collapsing the file editor that's great because now i'm going to need both consoles here one is in the python and it's in the previous one and now the first thing to do is very simple we are i was in the java so let me jump back to the python pathway and in particular to the sensor api part so how do you start um a fast api application that's that's the way so we have also installed uv cord which is uh basically um proxy layer implementing the so-called asgi specification for the modern asynchronous way of handling uh python web applications i will just run it sorry ubicorn api colon app should do the trick and then that's it so uh the api is running on port 8000 and as someone was very happy to see earlier notice that gitbot is immediately picking that up and showing you what what do you want to do with this part now in this case we don't want to do much because we're going to just issue a couple of requests but gitpod is very friendly to us in this case okay so let's say the api is running let me first run a query so i'm going to use curl of course you might want to do whatever you prefer you might want to do postman whatever i like curl so i'm just going to do a get to the endpoint sensors by network and the second part of the query of the url is the network name volcano net in this case and then i just use jq for fancier formatting so let me run these in the second console while the api is running and if you if you pay attention try to see how long it takes this time go okay so it took say half a second or so and you see on the right side console i get my nice results nicely packaged at a as a json so there are two different um sensors in the volcano net network with these and that properties all nice or good and that's it now if you look at on the left uh you notice that the session has been created a statement has been prepared a statement q3 and then that's it so now let me run this again the same get you see that was very much quicker and that's mostly because the the session is reused but also the statement is reused so even the prepare statement was cached on the first time and just reused again and this can be used as many times as you want with minimal overhead that's one of the main advantages of prepared statements besides the schema checking and everything oh that's a great experiment yeah yeah that's it takes a bit to to create the session in particular it's mostly the session okay so uh so in this case of a get you see the last part of the url was the parameter that the function corresponding to the endpoint would have to take and use let's do the other endpoint that is implemented measurement by sensor date this is as aaron said this is a post indeed we are passing a payload which is sensor sensor ready date a string so again this is something that i'm going to just take and paste here on the right okay so i get my results you see there are a few um a few measurements corresponding to sensor s1001 very good and in this case you see the session has been reused but the statement q4 has been has been prepared now because it's it was a new statement so if i do it again the statement q4 the prepare statement was in the cache already and so on so you get how it works now let's have a look at the api code a couple of minutes okay so uh well i we made it so that api is a single module which is not very dramatic but it would complicate things too much in the real in a real application you probably would have only this api code part in this module and the rest uh placed into several sub modules helpers and so on but that's of course not the goal for today uh let's start with the with the fast api part uh this is this is the core of the fast api code and well every endpoint is routed to a function a python function and you see how the parameter network is declared in the routing through this decorator this network is the same as this network which is the argument to the python function getsensor in this way this is all done for us of course and when this function gets executed upon a request the value of network will be whatever volcano knight forest net whatever and the rest is really nothing new so i have a i have a prepare statement for q3 and i use that to session execute as you know already and then i just repackage the results in a way that is ready to be returned uh bye bye to to to the requester something very similar happens for the post but in this case instead of having so how do the parameters the payload of the post get parsed that's something very cool of fast api in my opinion because you just have to define a pedentic data class which is here this base model this is uh this extends a pidentic based model you just define the shape of the payload you want so this sensor data stream query is going to be the data type for these params and if things match then everything will work automatically and you will be able to just access the body fields like param sensor params date and so on um the other cool thing oh let me just do one thing just to to to make the api get annoyed let me pass a wrong field name sensor x oh unprocessable entity and i get back a self-explanatory error message that's very cool and that's all done for us you don't have to write a single line of code to get that now back to us every one of these endpoints will need the db session right and that's also where fast api shines in my opinion because it has a sophisticated dependency system so you see fast api offers the depends object which can be just a parameter in your endpoint functions and with this syntax we will just have session available in any one of the endpoints ready to be used and this getdb session is basically the one you saw in the db connection except it is just wrapped to be a generator instead of just a straight function and that's it well uh that was a quick tour through fast api i i have to say i love this framework and i think it's the best out there at the moment so well maybe something very similar uh happens in the java case thanks to the magic of spring booth and the spring data cassandra in particular so maybe i can just show very quickly here is okay so the astra connect part yeah let's look at the screen mostly so after defining a bunch of data classes basically which represent input and output data types the the most the the most important part is the spring root application itself which is a class that is made into a rs controller and a spring boot application with the proper annotations and again that's something very similar to what you saw in the python case so there are annotations to attach methods to endpoints again network becomes network in the with this path variable annotation and something similar happens to parse to have the the request body for a post automatically parsed into an object that offers its members with get getters and set well getters in particular that's not much different and also the way prepare statements are cached and used and also the session is mostly similar except this is a class so it can leverage having members so these are just easier to handle but the gist is the same in the case of the java api oh that was quick and yeah i think we got somehow to the end almost on time yeah just about just about so there's something that is missing in this in today's workshop let's see if some of you can remind us what it is maybe there is a quiz to be played who knows okay let's go to the quiz let's see uh okay so if you can spare this last five minutes you might be winning so let's let me go back to the quiz and uh i'll give you the code again so thank you everyone for having enjoyed that and now it's time for the quiz so please join us if you haven't already to participate in quiz the the you need to open at browser tab or your phone and point it to either this uh qr code or go to menti.com and use the number you see on screen or in the chat six three five four three three six five um just uh just a remark in case so don't look at youtube for the questions because now timing is important you have to be fast and youtube has a few seconds of delay so don't look at youtube but look at your other tab or your phone for the questions because you want to be fast in answering uh yeah that's a question that we get now and then and oh yeah [Music] yeah yeah it's very much tricky okay so uh i think we can start with the quiz maybe i can try putting some music there you tell me if it's too loud with music okay so quiz time there are a few questions about what we saw today and i hope you will be able to give the right answer and fast enough to win your prizes so first question please gather all together here let's start with question number one ready remember not to look at youtube okay answer fast if you want to get more points and win okay so rest apis are based on the http methods and standard or they are a remote implementation of procedure call they offer great discoverability or they are required after a long workshop a bit of rest finally so pick your answer what will be and there we go yes first is true are based on the http methods and standard also called verbs right and loose specifications let's see the leaderboard okay so many answered correctly and looks like nitesh was the fastest but there are there is still some way to go and i'll move to next question number two answer fast to get more points microservices are a method to ensure tight coupling or they are only implemented through apis they are a way to isolate domains and workloads and reduce coupling or they are services for a micro company let's see like a one-man company uses microservices probably they are a way to isolate domains and workloads and reduce coupling sure they are not to ensure tight coupling well done let's see right right i love the micro company answer that's awesome okay so uh nitesh still keeps the top position manoj and josef follow dude okay there are still maybe five questions to go and let's see which is a true statement about apache cassandra ah that's nice is not highly available or is it great for table joins and all up queries it allows for geographic distribution on it runs only on aws so this is this was subject for a previous week but we went through it fair enough and it is correct most of you were correct patchy cassandra allows the database to be spread geographically over several locations a single database and for sure it doesn't run only on aws it is actually you can run also on a raspberry at least you used to maybe yeah that's right on a raspberry pi okay so kevin was the fastest but nitesh keeps the position and let's see how it goes question number four answer fast what were the frameworks used today in the hand zone micronode and jungle or maybe quarkus and flask or spring and fast api or maybe coffee chainsaw and screwdriver coffee chainsaw screwdriver yeah that one sounds fun yeah i wonder if chainsaw is something you drink that would make okay so spring and fast api that was it all right all right all right everyone was paying attention on that one so we were mostly on fast api but we also mentioned spring and looks like ah kuzak jumps to first position joseph and nitesh follow but still everything can happen so well done everyone answer fast for question about acid do acid requirements fit microservice architecture not really distributed isolated architecture is better fit for base or yes microservices perfectly support acid or yes it's if support acid configuration is explicitly enabled no microservices are alkaline do you say alkaline or alkaline i i think alkaline sounds right okay ah that was hard not really so acid is too strong uh requirement on how the various parts of the database have to speak to each other so to speak i mean it's more complex than that but that's just so the answer is not really and let's see what happens to the leaderboard after things seems that that was a big overhaul but nitesh jumps back kusa and joseph first second and third i don't know you're pretty really serious yes yeah it's a tight race okay which is not an advantage of cql prepared statements avoid extra trips for result set metadata or prevent cql injections or validate bind variable types on the client side or partition key based statements compute their own cluster routing so one is not an advantage all the other i think we talked about all of these except one yes well done so six of you got it right so there's nothing about sql injection protection in repair state yeah that's actually a benefit of using prepared statements in the relational world but yeah cql doesn't allow that anyway and so oh surprise laura jumps too fast wow that's really a handful of points so oh this is something okay it is sorry it is a handful of points so let's see what happens with the last question be concentrated and answer fast to connect to astrodb what is needed by the drivers one ip address from the cluster all ip addresses from the cluster or maybe secure bundle and token credentials or a bunch of phone numbers to connect to astra db mind that let's see what the answer is times up secure bundle and token credentials yeah the first would be more or less correct if we were speaking cassandra but this is a strategy and there's a special layer to introduce the proper routing and credentials and secrets for authentication so finally surprisingly laura wins followed by joseph and nitesh so very important before we leave good job that's awesome before we leave this screen laura joseph and nitesh please grab a screenshot of your winning screen and store it because later you will be asked to upload it to claim your price because you won a price a bit of data sucks swag uh i'm not closing this screen yet so you have time to take your screenshot but in the in a little time i will jump i will make it into a screen for a feedback of any kind from you so take your screenshot and in the meantime aaron i will go back to your life for the conclusion all right you know i just have to um give a quick shout out to karine my wife who um i can tell by her text messages has stayed on through the entire workshop and i i have to i'm just i'm so impressed with her for that so honey i love you if you're out there so anyway thank you for staying with us so yeah i have the screen up for the the swag winners you know make sure that um you know you take a screenshot of mendy and then fill out the form right right savannah they have to fill out the form that's here is that the form is now visible in the in the video and also on the youtube chat so there's a form to fill we just ask you for address and a screenshot of your winning screen of course and then we will reach you with uh how to get your your price yep get us get a swag package so there you go yeah all right so hey homework um you know if you um you do the um the exclamation point homework in uh in the chat it should give you a link to go to the homework form which is really just uh you know a couple of like theory questions um and additionally you know our homework is to have you um you know enrich the api by adding a new endpoint for um for uh for question one you know of of like of like get all get all networks so um yeah yeah so follow the instructions on that and submit in the form and you should get your badge all right um hey just in general if you're working with cassandra um or astra and you you want to get help on something um here these are just some resources that that we have available um you know we have our own discord server that we've obviously talked about quite a bit um today we are locked out but that's just so that's okay i was just going to say stack overflow if you have like a um a development based cassandra question is is really good especially in the cassandra tag um dba stack exchange which is really you know stack overflow for databases essentially um that cassandra tag is more for if you're running your own cluster and you're having a problem with like you know a node that won't start or you know something else that's that's goofy um in terms of uh like actually running your cluster that's where those questions go um but yeah don't be afraid to um follow those follow those tags on both of those sites it really does help the community out um yeah and of course you know we we talked a lot about discord but uh you know this is this is a quick shot of it we have a work workshop chat um channel in there as well as many others you know for um you know getting help specifically with like cassandra or astro development or um even even some of our like um uh pulsar and like other streaming services you can get help out there as well um so yeah oh and of course you know don't forget uh astroday san francisco is coming up um at the end of august august 24th um so yeah we'll be having uh some talks out there and um you know as an in-person event so uh so yeah if you're out in the bay area definitely check this out yeah i i live on the other side of the world but i've been told it's a very nice location so if you are in the region give it a thought especially if you are uh eager to go back to in-person events that's a cozy uh friendly small event to get you started for sure so for sure going to be fun and it's all about astra all right otherwise hey if if you haven't uh please um you know like this video and subscribe on our youtube channel um that way you'll get notifications of um you know like like other videos coming up and uh yeah i think this is uh this is really about it stefano yeah i would say so and uh yeah what is left to say thank you guys for being with us i hope it's been fun and of course you've learned a lot don't forget to subscribe and come back next time because we are going we have a lot of workshops for you so from my side i thank you and wish you a good evening morning afternoon
