    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems hi there welcome to another episode of the distributed data show I'm Amanda a Technical Evangelist this is David and we have Adrian he's on as well Adrian Collider and they we're all part of the tech evangelist team here at data sacks and today we're gonna be continuing the discussion around multi-cloud totally continuing so we have quite a few topics we want to talked about today so let's get let's get started so really we want to talk about today around our reference application that we have here which is killer video and if you haven't checked it out then you need to come out awesome yeah it's awesome I mean I didn't write any of it at all totally awesome yeah he wrote it on it's okay so you take it some time you gone you've checked it out now you're back to the video so let's kind of talk about it a little bit so you've been doing some like we've been all been doing a little bit of research work and a little bit of work around this with multi-cloud for this application so let's kind of have a couple of questions around there so kind of why do you need multi-cloud set up for an application like this like around killer video okay so if we look at what killer video is right you know at space it is it's a reference application that as our team were evangelizing Achatz so part of our job is to go out there and find ways to not only help teach and learn and things like that to the developer community and find ways to make people kind of awesome with all of our stuff right so we built you know over over the course of so many years we built a set of reference apps which which are killer video that essentially helped us kind of explore all the various kind of like technical things unit you might need to know well code looks like the full stack everything right so that's why killer video itself exists and we are now as you mentioned we are now like researching into this this whole multi-cloud thing and it just made sense that we take killer video when we move it there as well because from a developer advocate standpoint if if if we're gonna be able to help people kind of you know see what kind of considerations you need to take in a play you know what does this really mean for the code for the application what's it mean for the cluster all that kind of deal we need to go here right we need to do this essentially what it comes down to we also just put on the the Hat of the startup or the company that's had the super successful surge and users all of a sudden thinking from the perspective of like okay this is their app the killer video is their application and thought well okay they're having a surge of users in Europe and southeastern United States and down in California and all this stuff and currently we only have it in one or two points of presence in one cloud provider and we want to get it out to other places so we thought like how do we scale this how do we start to break this out to multiple clouds how do we increase the availability of it and make sure it stays secure and and all the aspects that would come up with that I think the best way to learn about something is doing it yep and so this is exactly what our purpose was to actually get in there get our hands dirty and get learning about it yeah absolutely yeah there's all sorts of little details all sorts of little details you can think about all you want but you won't know until you do it yep exactly so what kind of architecture do we have around for our multi cloud set up for the four killer video yeah okay so there's there's a couple different areas with this there's the the the application standpoint right and then there is the cluster standpoint right so for us the main the main change from the standpoint is the cluster right so killer video as it is today we already have a presence on the cloud right you know we've we've got a cluster up there that supports this but now now as we're moving into multi cloud we actually have to deploy a cluster that is represented on multiple clouds right right so we now have a set up with a single cluster multiple data centers each data center represents one of the cloud vendors or one of the one of the main ones so we've got one Azure we have one in GCP and then we have another in AWS right so yeah the big three the big guy right and and so that I mean in a very very basic very basic architecture standpoint that's the main change there so the cluster now is distributed on three day data centers on each of the the big cloud providers now from the killer video from the application standpoint or even before that from the data model standpoint now what I'm just about to say really depends on what you're doing with your app but for our purposes and what we're doing I needed to replicate across all of my DC's this isn't much different than what you would do if you wanted to replicate across DC's otherwise right you know so so we did have to change we had some we made some changes at least at the data model with our key space creation okay that simply enough we just set the replication settings so they will replicate across each one of those DC's right no big deal right so it's just a simple one-line change it's what you're saying yeah Wow yeah yeah yes simple yeah that part is easy yeah that part's easy I was just gonna say there's other changes though get work yeah yes yes I was I was totally getting there yeah so we talked about deploying the cluster level yeah right and that what was that challenging on that level whoa okay the different instances in the different cloud providers right no and I'm glad you I'm glad you said that because I totally glossed over that part honestly there in order to deploy in each of the clouds and to spin up instances and stuff like that you you generally have to know something about those individual providers now you can kind of mitigate that if you use something in I I don't mean this is like a plug but one tools like right scale right right scale is one way that you could use as a management platform on top of the providers to do this but you know it it takes some of that of the individual components that you need to do it takes it away and kind of yes but you still have to know how to use right scale you know you still have to know that right I can't get away from it honestly it does simplify but otherwise yes you would have to have enough knowledge in each one of the cloud providers right to be able to spin just generic instances here's where it gets kind of neat though is that like once you have the instances and and once you figure out like you want you know what the yes searches yeah once you know the resources you need how much how much RAM do I need what kind of disk do I need and things like that you can get comparable instances and the other ones pretty easily that's not that big of a deal but once you've kind of figured out how to spin up some instant instances at a very rudimentary level then the cluster deployment part is actually pretty easy okay and the reason why is now I'm speaking from the standpoint of using data sex Enterprise and such in it you know it's kind of tool that comes with an OP Center and lifecycle manager lifecycle managers like I I call it like the uber script thing because instead of having to go down to like individual instances and actually worry about right installing it I can actually just provision my whole cluster with lifecycle manager right and so that allows me to do it in a pretty seamless way so once I have access to those like SSH access I've got the right potentials on my instances I can kind of push I just push the instances with the nodes that I need however so that part see actually that makes that part easy once you've gotten to there so yes there might work to get to get to the level where you understand what you need to do in the instances okay right okay however you do that but once you've gone there great now Adrian was kind of alluding to this a minute ago where one of the big differences with doing this compared to what I'm gonna use the AWS example we currently have stuff deployed with the pre multi-cloud killer video in in AWS on that cloud now my application my application and my database my distributed database are actually separated for security reasons okay right so I have two V pcs at the BBC here for my application on the V PC here for my for my cluster and then we have a pairing connection between them there's Bastion servers are all sorts of things that lock that that click cluster down so I can't just walk into those nodes I can't you know I don't have access to actually that on my own cluster which is fine right right that's don't like that's the wrong purpose yeah yeah well here's the thing is what happens now I'm going a double us to GCP or ATS I can I do V PC pairing between them and then how do I get access to those right so all these questions start coming up and so what we chose to do and there are multiple ways you can go about this but what we chose to do is publicly expose the NotI peas now I realized that some listening right now might be like whoa what did you just say just to throw the copy it out there even though we did this it's not particularly a best practice or even yeah we're just going right this is just we you know we're doing some research here proof of concept type stuff yeah to make sure that we're actually communicating between the clouds seeing with the the Internet connectivity is between these points stuff like this because it definitely opens up all sorts of concerns especially if you're gonna you know do static IPS or even dynamic dynamic IP assignment you're opening up a bunch of IPs to denial service attacks all sorts of possibilities so even even though we've secured some of the communication between these points you know there's all these other issues now think about and a lot of a lot of big companies if they are gonna go multi-cloud they'll dive in with something like similar to how Amazon uses Direct Connect to connect between regions you can go third-party or even use some of the capabilities of the cloud providers themselves to connect to another cloud provider and set a dedicated VPN or something like that and effectively keep your database solution in a DMZ that's not connected to via the Internet so only your application and its VPC or virtual network or whatever the cloud provider would call it would be actually connecting to the database so there's there's a lot of solutions and a lot of ways but just this this caveat is that we didn't do it that way we connected via IP to IP from cloud to cloud right right and into that as well so from the killer video standpoint right I mean that's that's really all on the cluster and but the video standpoint one of the big changes we had to put in there is we now have a requirement for encryption right so if we're gonna expose these yeah we're gonna expose these nodes publicly right the minimum at least the minimum has to ensure that we're actually talking older encrypted channels so previously yes we had authentication worked in the killer video but we didn't have encryption we didn't have SSL or anything like that so we then had to go through in the killer video codebase and we had to add in that capability to talk through the the DSCC queue all drivers over and you know encrypted to the notes right so that that tickle I mean think about it that wasn't that much work okay it's not a ton of lines of code at all but if you're coming at it this is where it gets a little interesting if you're coming at it from a standpoint of not if you haven't done this before right and then you're trying to figure out what's a key store what's at rest or what's a CA cert file you know which on the driver they were actually a couple choices you could use you could use use the the native Java capabilities or use Neddie with open SSL like would you use using the open SSL one with Nettie okay and the reason why it was actually in our own driver docks it had a little line there and it just said it uses that any open SSL one this may improve performance I'm like okay I just yeah I was like okay that's that's yeah so so I mean and the cool thing is between the two implementations it was a couple lines difference so I want to I want to make sure that are not totally glossing over that because you know like I said if you're coming in a brand new there can be an initial hurdle yeah just because of the amount of information and knowing what to use now in our cluster the cluster was set up to use a CA sir okay so funny enough since we provision with LCM and everything like that it gives you that and I can just download it and then now I've got the certain that I need right and then I could I could add that into the application and stuff so so that made it from that standpoint that was pretty easy but there's all day on that one topic alone right you can do all sorts of different combinations of how you're handling encryption and such so we kind of took the simplest path just to get there right yeah and so in so pretty much what that meant is in the core of killer video and then some of the more ancillary micro services that we had anything that actually connected to the cluster and needed to do things on the cluster we they add in the capability to do that over and encrypted and encrypt the channel I see you know what one thing to add to that to that specific thing to that we did and you know I added the caveat that said this is not particularly what we're saying you should do it's one of the capabilities that you'd want to have even if you're going cloud the cloud and you have another solution going on like VPN connection from here to there or whatever like if you win multi cloud and let's say you're using AWS and somebody else in AWS has a bunch of these you know these security certifications the other cloud provider may not that could be a problem so you you don't even know once you leave a certain point like is your what's your encryption level on this stuff like is is it being secured via the VPN like what's what's on the other end what's happening there so you still even within the cloud once you make your connections even if it's VPN to VPN on the other end or something you probably still want to secure your database communication in cloud the cloud implementations at the application level also and this and this continues onward to I mean of course there's how to store data the right way how to hash things the right way etc etc a lot of different things that really need to come in to to account and this is definitely one of them you know make sure that your point-to-point communication for your app is secure in addition to whatever other methods you're using to actually secure the overall pipe I think honestly what we're saying is security is at every level yes I mean that's that's exactly what we're saying each level you have to be thinking about security and what you're gonna do with that and so I kind of wanted to go off of that which is so we talked about kind of the application interacting with the database and the security that we had to consider with the encryption there but what about kind of more of the the cluster level the database between different providers what kind of security considerations do we need to think about there right well in one part we've already touched on right is already the note to know decryption right that a matter of fact I just to be clear if it wasn't or that the the encryption that we are talking about from the application to the DC driver to the cluster that that connectivity there that is in our case anyway it's the same that is the same certification everything as it is from node to node okay right so that made that part of it pretty easy I think from from that standpoint so as far as though I mean so yes you already have no denote encryption that is just part of that is part of the capability that already exists there now Adrian you would touch on earlier I mean it's not what we're doing but you had touched on earlier about some other some other potential paths like whether you're talking VPNs or are some other things there thank
