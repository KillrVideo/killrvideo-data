    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data stacks Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed system welcome everyone to distribute data show I'm Patrick fat I'm live here in the studio in San Francisco with me today is Jeff carpenter and on the line all the way from Denver Colorado we have Luke Tillman hey Luke hello fellow humans and as a guest today we have Deva Gilardi who's also a host but we're just gonna pretend like you're a guest today today's a guest today's guest II he's got that very good yeah you know and so David this is gonna this is going to be a little question-and-answer I think just a set up you know you you came here today two stacks as somewhat new to this what we what we build Cassandra Davis ex Enterprise and I would I think is be really helpful to share your experience as someone who's brand new to this for people who also are new to this because that's a pretty common problem or hear people say how do I get started exactly so before we dive into the Cassandra data sacks Enterprise learning experience David why don't you set the stage for us and tell us a little about your background okay yeah so let's see so I've got over 20 years experience and IT programming and databases at one time in the past the certified Oracle DBA but that was a long time ago and I'll really count that anymore have time in my sequel Postgres Microsoft sequel server a lot of OLAP stuff let's see from the programming standpoint my core is Java but I'm pretty much coated in all the major languages even some odd ones and like lingo and you know shell scripting Perl JavaScript bailing goes off there's all of our whole dessert thing we can do lingo is actually underrated but I'm not going to go there now because I'm going to totally do a different thing that we're doing now there are no we ship no drivers for lingo even ahead and then from the from the IP perspective you know I actually in beginning of my career I was working on operations and monitoring a large enterprise system thing you know the infrastructure on that an order of hundreds of thousands of server and network devices that could a deal I've always had lots of operations and DevOps kind of work I eventually turned into you know a lot of AWS cloud kind of stuff and son of a whole set of different infrastructure and you know application systems not going to deal on the cloud that's real experience then you are out hope you're real engineer a real one yes you're not just a fancy hat guy I like to think you know yeah but you like the Hat you like the Hat those are important yeah no it's great I know you have one with a beard is include someday we'll we'll include that in in the show but today it's disturb it much the beard one is really cool so you you came I mean obviously have a wealth of experience behind this but did you have any experience with Cassandra or data sex Enterprise and any of the technologies inside of it I mean there's a lot of different technologies of course you could have experience with some bits and pieces where was your experience yeah so coming into data fact um the only thing that I probably had some experience with from from previous from a previous company and some work there would have been solar right so that obviously now as far as DC you know powers the the search component but other net I mean I had a ton of relational database experience but when it came to that Cassandra spark graph any of that stuff totally new right so I came into it a pretty pretty new if you will as far as the the data stack stack goes so you mentioned relational databases but what about any other kind of distributed databases or maybe even distributed systems so you know like people argue these days everybody building distributed systems because all web apps are distributed but yeah distributed databases distribute systems that kind of experience yeah you know it's funny you just the way you did because um as you're asking me that question so what comes mind is you know from the distributed database standpoint I mean in all actuality no now-now I definitely remember does not account we remember that sure yeah yeah that's one of them I'm not going to help that friends don't my friend chard and that's not a tribute database sorry I'm just gonna play play that make sure everyone knows that I'm a little opinionated on this but on that card out there right now none really starting I didn't know yeah yeah just keep it yourself yeah we had a lot of infrastructure that would say had situations where we had master/slave kind of architecture where slaves were you know replicas that were spread geographically you know in multiple zones and I can be able that's not really a distributed database kind of thing from the application standpoint again especially dealing with the cloud you know I've built a lot of applications that were designed from the ground up to again be distributed in the sense right that you had instances that were spread across multiple regions and that kind of deal and load bound properly with that kind of but that's not I don't think that's a distributed you're probably asking about Luke so I would say that's probably know that I didn't other than doing stuff like i said with them geographic distribution and such i didn't really have any experience with distributed true distributed systems okay so david we've established that you know you had a little background with distributed systems but not really with distributed databases so you're faced with this task this is now your job being good at apache cassandra and davis ax enterprises so how did you go about doing this where did you jump in to where you just like you downloaded it and you just started doing stuff or training or how did you get going with it well part of its kind of started with a prodding from patrick funny enough because before i even started he had me already looking into the DSA that the data sex academy courses right to actually get in some of that material but generally my philosophy on this kind of thing like shiny object kind of guy I love getting new knowledge new things so I will usually jump in to say you know like reading materials and whatever wherever stuff like that but at the same time I got to get my hands on the keyboard that just has to happen in order for me to make a connection and really put it all together so it was you know I went through pretty much all of the DSA material all the courses and at the same time I actually ordered a set of raspberry PI's I blog post on this by the way that shameless fluxions like but some solid move with the raspberry PI's with thank you that was actually a you know so I ordered a set of raspberry PI's and actually set up my own cluster started you know and since I have an Operations background and I really like like he likes and that kind of deal I you know got an OP Center with that then eventually moved into LCM the lifecycle manager that kind of work on auto deploying all of my nodes and but I did those together right and what was interesting too is that the academy adhere the courses they provided like I'm so glad I went through them because well one they're really nice they're they're really quite I mean they have good production value they actually get quite deep right and and in particular the the vm's are provided with big exercises and such like that they ask like hard questions they don't just give you the answers to like you've device to learn which is great so that gave me a base level of understanding and then there were so many new tidbits that came out of those that when I was doing my own cluster for real if I had not done that I would have made a ton of ton of mistakes right I still made mistakes but it would sell anyways through the combination of both really so the answer question I did both of courses and then I set up my own cluster you know with the raspberry PI's and eventually evolved that into my ec2 instances and things alright so that was a pretty high bar if you think about like the resource constraints of a Raspberry Pi I mean was there were there any configuration parameters and the cassandra tamil file that you didn't have to touch res that I if a is a constraint here oh yeah like I actually loved doing it on the PI's I think the pies are awesome it was it was nice because you know I could do they're not terribly expensive I can get them up running but you're absolutely right talk about like low commodity stuff yeah I need to tweak a lot of stuff to get it to just barely run I would not recommend it for production it's secure if you're watching this you're like oh yeah I'm did it do Raspberry Pi no don't do that that's due for training and learning and that kind of deal but no it was that was part of the challenge not only that the OS that's being used you know like it offered some challenges in what type of insulation how to get things set up amount of memory I can allocate all sorts of things the speed of the disks which are really just you know like yeah that's just on there so it's they're great for learning and matter of fact in some ways you could even argue that it was better to do it on those because it gave me an idea of what the lowest bar could be for actually trying to run the stuff and it forced me to get into some configuration parameters and stuff that if I had beat your machines I probably wouldn't even had to know about so you know I have a long history with raspberry PI's and destroying them I think they're fantastic but yeah I did get a little grief from the Raspberry Pi community okay I have you earned that yeah a little bit but it did show that that they do work in the worst possible way so and in along those lines one of the things that I ended up doing which was really quite information on this going about this way once I had my cluster set up right and I was you know essentially telling out all my old miner logs in a kind of deal I would purposely rip out you know the ethernet cable from the Raspberry Pi or two or something like that and see what my cluster did we've really kinda neat actually to watch again coming from the experience I did with relational databases and dealing again with like master slave architectures that can the deal you just do that kind of thing it was really neat that was one of those wild moans I have of Cassandra in general watching this thing I gank one of those out and then watching it just kind of repair itself and get everything going again it was from resiliency standpoint that was really neat to go through so what the raspberry pi's it was easy to do because I could just rip a cable out that was yeah that's a lot of cheaper than hitting it with an axe - yeah the less might get fun so I mean that so the Raspberry Pi experience for you is I think really good you might have up the the level of hard on this I mean they just gave you a lot to work with but in general how is the learning curve I mean because there's a lot to learn already it's a huge topic yeah yeah so let's say so from the learning curve standpoint I really kind of teaching level I see there's the easy the easy part up here which is okay so I came into this with pretty much no knowledge of any of the data section of price stuff except for like I said a little bit of solar in that kind of deal so I was able to go in and download DSC get it running and the example I want to use with this is I'm saying about a previous company where we implemented solar right in order to do that with our app with a relational database and we didn't know what we had to learn solar we had to deploy it we had to write the code in our app connector to actually talk to the thing so we could get data over to it we have the right to peace that does all the polling that you know got the data through it on a you know pretty often basis and that kind of deal so we had to know a lot about what was going on with solar before we could even get going right so where are the moments I had when I when I pulled down BSE and I was I was working with this stuff is to enable solar with a command line switch like I was like oh that's awesome right and then yeah of course you have to UM of course you have to you know you have to enable search index things like there's a little bit configuration but the amount of configuration I had to do to get that running with search was totally different from what I had to do at a previous company where I actually had to implement and deploy solar so from that standpoint from let's running by that easy part right if I want to just skim the top of things between search craft you know analytics and Cassandra you could download the stuff and kind of get going right without knowing it's too deep you gotta know something set but now that that's where it goes from easy and now we'll go deep because the second you even get into like in Cassandra even something which seems simple like replication factor in consistency levels right you can totally do that wrong and I have agreeance doing that wrong and that in itself right depending on the size your cluster how many nodes you have what you're trying to do that net so can can take some thought there's some complexity there graph is another great example to me I love graph it's just so powerful to meet everything but that's when they get complex really fast so again you can skim the surface and you can have the easy kind of learning curve but then the second you start digging in it gets pretty deep fast for pretty much all of them so for lack of a better word David I want to talk about I want to talk about baggage for a second though so I kind of mentioned you know at a previous I mean you just talked about having previous experience with solder and I think you know for most of us out there you know we unless we just came out of school and and you know haven't had any work experience yet or training or something like that a lot of us have prior experience like you and I with relational databases I'm curious what was you know kind of what was that like like you know bringing the baggage of you know relational day to day issue experience with you you know what like was it helpful was it hurtful like you know what um you know kind of on balance kind of how well is that coming from relational database yeah yeah that's a good question so one of the if it's funny you ask this because what are the ones that I still struggle with today right it's coming from decades in the relational database world and designing tables schemas all that kind of deal right is it's pounded into you from day one third normalized form right and generally you stay away from replicating data around all your different tables and that kind of deal you know you try to you try to cut down on that as much as you actually can use joins and such to kind of handle that but in the in the distributive database for old Cassandra that kind of deal it is totally common and depending on you know the needs of your application like questions you're trying to answer they have multiple tables sitting right next to each other some of them with the same data across them right because it all be normalized so that is something that that I still sometimes feel like I'm doing it wrong like I must be doing this wrong because I've just been doing it a certain way with relational databases for forever so yeah so that was definitely I guess that would be on the to answer your kind of your the way you posed that that kind of the hurt right that's part of the ones that I still struggle with and making sure I have that correct now in rounds knocking syndrome but you allow to get over that no I'm okay with you Oracle I really am thank you thank you for giving me a great database I love you yeah that's not called syndrome oh yeah maybe maybe I am sinner yeah and you know but from the from the help standpoint you know I guess there there are a couple things there one if you are if you come from the relational world at all right you're familiar with SQL and the transition to see - well was there was no transition I mean it was absolutely seamless and it's just like it I mean you've got flex payments you've got altars I mean maybe you know let's have a phenomenal command but like you've got the same semblance and the same style that you you would have been used to doing things before I mean there's some syntactic differences maybe if you're using spark or whatever you know you get to something a little bit different but generally it's felt just like what I was used to so there was really no transition from that so if you get that experience that's great one of the other cards now is gonna sound this might sound a little obvious I'm at the end of the day like coming from a relational database background and coming in then to you know the Cassandra base it's also a database the same concepts you know all the same ideas and stuff transfer over right it's a different approach yes absolutely but it's still database at the end of the day so that was something I actually think that experience with the relational world again kind of came right over and understanding kind of what's going on right with with Cassandra so yeah I'd say that was kind of those really some of the helpful parts there cool so what I did is I think that we're going to collectively now proclaim you no longer a noob yeah all right good lower gonna happen I think we just declared it we just declared it to be so you know to be that anymore yeah so okay as a as a former noob with Cassandra and DSC you're now standing on the other side of this divide wow I feel so different here and your your advice let's say I'm a new developer and I am yeah I am now in the position that you were in just a short time ago what is your advice to me what am i key takeaways on how to get started wrap it up yeah okay well so for the first thing I mean honestly it's going to go back a little bit to don't say oh you're talking about don't say lingo it's not lean oh well okay man all right okay all right just making sure I okay I was going to do open I use kind of Jing mode ya know I going back to one of the things we kind of talked about the beginning I I'm one of the people just my general philosophy like I said I I got to get my hands on the keyboard but I'm also going to look at whatever materials there that the Davis X Academy stuff but if you're starting out new the courses I mean even if you're not for some advanced stuff in there but they're really well done really good production values get into and they're free that was one of the things I kept doing if I was I didn't know they were free at the time though when I first started I kept saying to myself my god I would totally pay for things like like I wish I had this previously and then I found it later they were free and I was like that's kind of awesome but the amount of time I spent on them the especially the ends with the exercises get into those they will give you so many so much good information starting out right but at the same time you've got to get your hands on the keyboard whether it's raspberry pies or send up some ec2 instance or some create your own cluster like do that you know because I went to BSA live as well and in there yeah you go through this whole thing where you actually have a multi node cluster and stuff but it's all in the same instance the second I started working with separate individual servers with their own IPs and different networks in that kind of deal it it changed my level of understanding because there's more that you have to take into account so get your hands on the keyboard you know get some get some past pies or get some eASIC you ences and go take a look at the courses and do both honestly and I think that will probably give you all the intimate you need to get going and kind of point in the directions to to move on your own Wow alright some pretty solid advice yeah I'm I'm pretty happy about that I think now now I'm just going to point everyone to this video and say how do you get started I got a video for you okay excellent all right well thanks a lot David for being our guest this time around you can be host next time okay you graduated I graduated this awesome I'm so good yeah and take you
