would help if I turn myself off a mute while I'm introducing everybody there we go and hello everybody Welcome to week three of our a January learning boot camp series app development with Apache Cassandra all right so before we get started if you can all hear me and see me give a thumbs up let us know that you can hear us and see us matter of fact rags and Cedric if you want to say hello that way we can get some thumbs up yeah so that's the third week so week three and you get four or three speakers makes sense right that's that's does that mean next week we're gonna have four speakers did you just set that up thanks Cedric nice job nice job exactly yeah yeah but again good morning good afternoon or good evening wherever you are I just like saying that and uh you know glad to be here wonderful and I see vladislav says all nice and wesy with thumbs up havav Scotty s Maran sounds like they can hear us all right wonderful all right step number one right right exactly so we can hear you and see you wonderful okay so um welcome again everybody and separate from the three of us who are um on today as usual we have a whole set of our other Advocates and part of the team that are on the chats right so if you have your questions this is meant to be an interactive session uh so if you have questions no matter what they are feel free to ask them in the YouTube chat in the Discord chat uh wherever we are and we'll do our best to get to them now to just start with who we are um I'm David Jones schery uh I'm a senior developer Advocate uh I've got a bunch of years coding in various languages I've you know a bunch yeah B bunches bunches of years um you know I've I've been uh certified in Oracle before I'm certified in Cassandra today I do lots of training and teaching and such like that and I love learning with everybody um so uh hopefully one of these days we'll actually see some of you in a live event like as an inperson live event that would be really cool uh next on the docket here is Cedric Lon Cedric tell us about you yeah happy to be here with you so I'm leading the developer advocacy team at datastax I've done a lot of uh Java Cassandra and I'm doing a lot of API as well and you know lately I had a chance to build the Astra SDK so S software development kit that's everything you need to wrap the apis around Astra you know the tool that we have used for the past two weeks and we will keep using uh um in the in this boot camp awesome and then over to Mr Rags hey there Rags all right who are you who are you you perfect David you took the easy option there because uh you know a lot of people around the world have a tough time pronouncing my name so I did take I just why did you call me out jeez come onas but I go by Rags easiest way to remember me is Rags not to riches um one of one of the criticisms we have gotten from the past two weeks and not quite criticism but you know you you not been able to do hands on right I am a mechanical engineer I like to see things move and the closest you can come to seeing things move is uh you know is uh code right so we're going to do a lot of code today um you know quite a bit and and actually what I would urge you uh is kind of diing a little deeper U go beyond what you know we're going to show in this Workshop today uh but I myself I've worked on distributed systems I mainly work on the uh on the middleware where you know things are working as long as things are working fine nobody even going to notice me right uh but you know the moment things are broken then you know we are responsible right so uh I I am a big champion of what I call as the inner loop and I'm you know I'm with distributor systems uh kubernetes and all that things have gotten a lot easier I come from a cloud Foundry background very easy to push applications um and so on so so that's kind of what I'm championing as well so that's a little bit short introduction of myself absolutely and you know for the Hands-On portion I hope you all received the breadboards in your uh in the mail there for my that's a dou joke for anybody who knows what I'm talking about there anyway so looking at looking at the uh that was a terrible joke honestly I'm just going to call it out right there no I like the breadboard joke I really like it so so looking at the agenda what we're going to cover for today so if you've been with us before like hi Casey we we saw Casey online earlier um you know we usually and and we're going to do it here go through little housekeeping just kind of set you up for the tools uh that we're going to use today the things to expect um then we're going to Branch out a little bit into a to-do application very simple crud application to use to kind of just show you the basics of how you can set up um a back end with a patch of Cassandra in various languages so we're going to explore things in Java JavaScript and python today um then we will look at then well how do I connect my app to Cassandra right what does it take to do that uh and then we'll follow up with executing some basic crud statements now the key thing about this is this is going to form the basis um of some of what you're going to do in the homework right so a lot of what we're going to do today with you um is going to be showing right you can follow along and things like that and and kind of explaining you know how do you do the basic crud operations but the homework is actually going to have you do something a little bit on your own and then following up that last section is going to be our swag quiz as usual um the homework for you and what is coming up in the next week okay so this is week three of our four-week boot camp Series in learning January um and guess what if you weren't with us in the previous weeks no big deal right uh the whole goal of this four-week um this four-week boot camp is to prepare you and get you set up to be able to take your Apache Cassandra development uh certification uh but again if you haven't been with us in the previous weeks you can just go to the repo the the one repo that we're going to share today has all all the information all the homework and everything and again it's designed to give you all the materials and everything uh that you need for certification so this week um is focusing on the backend pieces where in the previous weeks we gave you uh you know intro to Cassandra Cassandra fundamentals what is it all about how does it work then we moved into Data modeling and now we're going to take that knowledge and we're going to apply it uh to some of the backend uh pieces and how do you start coding with Apache Cassandra and then week four uh will be taking that one step further and building API and microservices as well for Patrick Sandra I know Cedric is leading that one and Cedric is totally like an API person so if you want to I am I am Get Ready Get Ready all right so now the cool thing about these is each one of the sessions that we do you can earn yourself a nice badge right um and you can brag about them you can put them on LinkedIn and such and we actually have quite a few now and I know that there are some folks out there that like to like like Pokemon right they like to get them all um so what do you need to do to get the batch well the first thing you need to do is attend one of our streams you're attending one right now uh we also have one tomorrow that is a little better for a folks in a m and APAC TimeWise but just attend one of the live stream events right um and during the events uh we'll do that on YouTube and twitch twitch we kind of use as a backup uh we can we can handle questions both in the YouTube chat but then also in Discord notice that link up at the top uh right of the page here this Discord we'll drop that nightbot should be dropping Discord at some point in the chat here soon um one of the things to point out about Discord is Discord is great from a persistent standpoint YouTube while we're doing the stream will be answering your questions and stuff but then the second the stream ends so does the YouTube chat so if you've got followup questions about your homework or if you want to connect to our 20,000 strong Community or something like that you really want to go to Discord right and sign up for the Discord server on the bottom there again if you've been with this you'll be familiar with this but if not uh we use ment.com that is where we're going to ask you some questions and then we're going to do our swag quiz later uh so you're going to want to pull that up here very soon okay so first thing attend one of the streams then complete the labs we're going to rags is going to go through those with you today um so that's part of your homework um the labs are going to use a combination of set of tools uh one of those is going to be Astro DB uh which which is uh data stacks's database as a as a serverless database as a service I love Service as a service that's always funny to say but it's our serverless system buil built on a Patrick Cassandra so uh this allows you to launch a fully-fledged aache Cassandra cluster uh in just a couple minutes right as compared to having to completely roll your own what's cool is all the stuff we use is going to be free right uh so you don't have to worry about kind of any pay walls or anything like that today we will also use G pod so if if you're not familiar with Git pod it's essentially it's a vs code IDE uh it is offered by GitHub so it's actually linked into the GitHub repository so the very place that we're going to follow Rags through the exercises you'll be able to spin up a cloud-based IDE it'll be preconfigured for you and everything so we really recommend taking that path um and then GitHub as well is where the repository uh is for us to do to work I mean even though it's it's a GitHub uh you know you can use it with you know like gitlab as well if you want um so you know it's it's a pretty independent um you know ID in the cloud s to say and and David uh while while you're talking should we let the audience into the secret that we were talking about uh like the boot camp Warriors or something you know if you do all the homework uh um should we should we let him in let them in on the secret if you want I mean you're you're telling them about it now you might as well tell them might as well right yeah so so the idea is you know if you complete all the workshops do the homework and all that we are we are discussing uh the fact that you know you take the time to do all this um you know to at least uh have a moniker something like a boot camp Warrior or something you know we haven't quite figured it out you know we welcome suggestions as well um so so the idea is that you know you are able to start from scratch but at the end of week four you're able to show a completely working app um you know that's that that's the goal and we want to reward you for that cool awesome yeah so we'll see more to come on that one um so then complete the labs that we're going to do today then we're going to give you some more Learning Materials uh I believe this week part of what you're going to be assigned in datax Academy is ds220 data modeling um to work through some of the items there again this is getting you on the path to certification right so if you've been with us so far and you've been doing the homework you would have already gone through all of ds201 which is Cassandra fundamentals and now we'll be going into ds220 which is data modeling and both of those are needed for your certification uh and then with that the tools there academy. data.com again all the stuff by the way all these resources they're given to you in the repo like we're not just going to leave you to kind of figure that out on your own um so we'll give you all the resources and everything that you need all right finally then uh we will give you a form and the homework it's going to have some questions our weekly test right kind of shows us that um you've been paying attention or you've learned some things things and like I said there will be a little extra piece there in the homework for you to write a little code of your own and if you do all those things then you can get your badge for the week um now this week is this cool one over here this build a Cassandra back end uh so far we've had the introduction to Cassandra and data modeling next week I like that badge by the way this one looks really neat the build apis in microservices one um and what's really even another level of cool right is if you get all four of these there's like a super badge you get like a super super badge you can get for doing all four all right so rag it's a golden badge yeah it is a golden badge it is a golden badge so uh if you want to be like Charlie and you know get your golden badge and end up with willly Wonka then there you go that's how you do it alrighty so how one other question that we got I was just about to ask about questions yeah yeah so so you know the question we get is when can I submit my homework is it due next week you know we realize that you're all busy professionals so so even though um you know we insist on the homeworks um you know we are a little bit relaxed on that so so don't take too long but but you know uh I think you will have time until February you know to maybe at least a little into February to complete that on that Rags so um not been announced yet but you know we really want you to be certified on castra so the target is really that you will have all the materials after four weeks uh then we will give you some time to to review uh and mid-February we will do like U training the certification you know are you ready for the certification like a dry run exam live like today for you uh so uh yeah get you know having the homeworks done by mid-February would be great to be ready y all righty so everybody you may have noticed on the screen I just flashed up a QR code and a code so join us here at ment.com or you can just scan the QR code with your phone as well um and let's see how many folks do we have with us today all right so we should probably be able to get at least 80 what do you think 80 in there um join us join us on m.com so what we're going to do here is we're going to ask you a couple questions just to kind of you know find out where you're from uh get a couple pieces of information for the work that we're going to do today later on though today we're going to use menty for your swag quiz right so we want to encourage every everybody to join us there let's see how are we doing okay I got 40 in let's get some more folks on I'll put the QR code back up and the code will be always written at the very top of the screen yes so even if even when David switch to the other screen the code is always at the top so open a new tab m.com under this code and keep this new tab open to the very end of the workshop because at the end we will play a game together that's right and we'll have fun music all right I think I think we can go ahead and while people are getting in we'll just start asking some questions so the first one here where are you from I think this is one of my most fun Parts I love this part you know we we have a lot of times people answer in the chat and and such and we before we had this map but this is just so cool um it it shows really how connected we all are even though we're across the globe um and it's always wonderful to see people from different parts of the world where it's like 11:00 p.m. or something so thank you for joining us when it's that late for you we have some from Alaska I that's oh yeah we do check that out that is very cool now either someone's from one of the Caribbean islands or in the ocean so if you're on a yacht please invite us to your yacht exactly lots of folks from India look at all the folks from Africa this is wonderful oh wow it's still amazing to see all dark popping up right never get tired oh we have one from New Zealand yeah I see that that's to see how we can be distributed that's just great yeah oh I see we've got one down in h South America as well oh now who is that way up North we I see some folks up in like Scandinavia and everything but that's like way up North that's amazing so Elena responded she's not on but is in Cuba I think Cuba I'm I'm in Florida by the way so hello we're neighbors all right well thank you everybody for filling that part out that's always fun to see and first question which of the previous sessions in this January boot camp series have you attended always curious to see oh we some I just got here just got here that's what we were expecting a lot yeah by the way if you just got here as I I think rag was saying earlier no big deal um if you're like oh my God there's all this homework do it at your own pace it's not not a concern at all okay so we have oh look we have a good like a third of the people from both previous weeks wonderful this is an interesting this is more or less what we expected did we or did we expect more of the I just got here I'm not quite sure we you know there's always new folks I'm actually happy to see so many folks coming from the previous ones as well okay all right thank you welcome back those 39 people yes welcome back and the 15 and 11 from week one and week two sure all right thank you everybody next question have you finished all of your boot camp homework this is the time for us to shame you totally shaming you I'm totally oh wow we've got some yeses honestly it's it's a lot of stuff I wasn't it's not easy I wasn't I wasn't entirely sure we were going to get many yeses yet so that's wonder wow there's a lot of yeses wow you're all on top of it yes there is homework for those wait there's homework yes there's homework um again it's up to you if you want to do it you you choose what you want to put in from this standpoint again the goal for us other than information Shar and information sharing not Shar and and learning together and stuff like that is to get you the information you need to get your Apache Cassandra certification right um and while folks a quick anecdote right like you know from a career standpoint back in the day when I had my when I got my Oracle certification this is a long time ago now that one thing got my foot in the door at more places just because right right um it's no different with a pat of Cassandra and Cassandra admins and Cassandra operators are actually some of the highest paid like they're there's some wonderfully paying jobs for that so it's it is it is a lucrative business to get into so if you have any interest in getting your certification whether you want to be an admin or you're a core developer and you want to know how to work with Apache Cassandra it's worth it right it's absolutely worth it okay and I see I good I see a lot of people created the database and some use some to use tables so we'll we'll get you going with all that today as well and then last one for the questions what language driver are you planning to use for this Rook shop you can choose more than one by the way you don't have to do one but it's up to you we'd like to always get a a feel this is my third cup of coffee today is it too much you think I've too much yeah how much is too much yeah this is about what we expected right most people are going to try python um you know quite a few in Java this this helps uh for the undecided that's kind of I'm I'm just curious what that means right you know um they're going to decide by the end of the workshop hopefully it's okay you know the cool thing about it and I give mad props to um rags and Stefano and and Chris and team um the repos that we're going to go through the exercises it's been set up this is actually quite cool when you spin up that giod IDE it's going to set up all three of them for you at once and you can choose any of them and it's seamless um so so hopefully that will be uh really cool for everybody so if you're undecided it it really doesn't matter yeah and and in fact you know when I do the demo I'll mix and match them if I can uh so going from one language to the other so so really doesn't matter you know so I'm sure you can decide by the end of the workshop absolutely okay so with that um how are we doing then on questions is there anything else that we need to uh take into consideration from that standpoint before I move on I think the only question that came up was can I get a badge even if I did not attend the previous Workshop unfortunately no right oh oh you can you can get the yeah as long as you do the homework you're good you know yeah okay okay yeah if you do the homework and submit it this session could be done it's stand alone you won't get stuck if you did not attend the first two session we will skip the data get the swag yeah right we will skip the the the data model piece but uh you you won't stuck would do the exercises with us absolutely we we strongly encourage you to do that right yes exactly all right so with that let's go ahead and get into the to-do app we're just going to look you know just set some context do a little bit demo and stuff like that some some pretty easy stuff um so if you've not used a to-do app before you you probably have but um you know what's actually really cool about the to-do app here is that uh there is both the to-do MVC project and the to-do backend project which provide you with just about any language you can think of from the front end implementation and also the backend implementation and the to-do app itself the whole framework was built so you could explore a language and have you know basic operations those crud operations create read update and delete the the core of anything for any application when working with the database that you need right so the to do MVC in backend show you how to implement something very very simple in both the front end and the back end and then tie it back into the database so that's why we're using this example here today so the basic to- do app is kind of what you see here I'm going to show you a demo here in a second um but you know I've got individual to-dos that I can add in I can check their you know status and such like that um you know so it's a pretty simple model the key thing where I want to tie it into is what's going on up here so notice these field names so if you were with this last week uh with the data modeling you would have built this out now don't worry about that you're going to you're going to end up building this out again today um we'll have it as part of the exercises but just to power this little to-do app right you need things like a user ID why because what happens if I have multiple users in my system I don't want to just Mash all of their to-dos together right so I need to differentiate on that I have an item ID that will be representative of each to-do item um the title of the to-do item whether it's completed a buo in there right is it completed true or false and then the order what order I want them in so part of what I need to do in the back end is I need to implement this data model or or data model that supports these fields uh in this functionality to then power our Tod app and with that let's go ahead and pop over I've got a little bit of just a real simple simple demo this is actually something really cool by the way um if you notice where I'm at I'm at to-do back end.com um this is part of to-do MVC and to-do back end if you go there like I said it provides all these languages you can just like hook it up and and do things so the first thing what do we want to do what what to-dos do we have today um conquer the Galaxy okay let's do that right um what else you guys are you guys hungry um you know do we need to eat more uh Foods right eat more Foods what else needs to be done what do you think Cedric Rags anything uh no I norin what was that speed up to get speed up to be on time speed up oh be on time I feel like yeah okay there we go let's speed up Beyond Time okay wonderful so notice though you know for one I can enter in the to-dos right now when I do that each of those items is actually being stored in the back end right that's being stored in the database in the table that's where it's persisting right and then these little checkbox if I say it's completed right all these little kind of operations and stuff um and things all of that is being stored in the back end and that's what we are going to do today all right now in order to do this right if you remember from last week and if you weren't here don't worry I we'll explain anyway but from last week um through the data modeling piece one of the core principles when you're data modeling for something like Cassandra is a is a bit different um in the way that you might do it from a relational database we using things like normal forms third normal forms and such in the relational sense you know you're going to start with a set of data and then you were going to model that data based off of normal forms but Cassandra uses a denormalized data model right now by the way if you're like what are you talking about I would suggest you go back to last week this is a refresher right so the material last week will cover this in detail and such like that but generally speaking it's a denormalized data model but the key thing I want you to take away right here is this in Cassandra you start both with your application workflows and your conceptual data dat models you don't even need to know the data at this point right these two enough matter of fact the workflow the application workflows you can literally napkin out a basic ux of your app and generate your data model in Cassandra this way um and if you go through the the you know like the the previous uh week uh and the data modeling stuff you'll see how to do that um but you use both conceptual data model and your application workflows you use that to then generate what's going to be first your logical data model down after you know you optimize and stuff to your your physical data model and the next slide I'm going to show you some examples of this and again if you uh you know if you weren't here with us last week no big deal um you can do that but it's it's a pretty simple flow right and at the end of the day you want something that looks like this right I want a table on my backend database that's going to support the requirements I have for the app now if you take a look at the left hand side these fields should look familiar these are the ones that we were talking about um in the to-do app itself uh notice that user ID here uh has this K that just means partition key right this is so I'm going to Partition by my user ID right and that way uh for any particular set of to-do items for user I can just make one read I'm going to get all those to-do items back also you might notice this C this is a clustering column so in Cassandra that means how I'm going to either set uniqueness or ordering um now something interesting about our item id field here is a Time U ID so The UU ID is a unique identifier and then there's a time stamp this is a nice little object so it combines both what this means though is I can time order data right so not only uh for this par particular table can I get all the too items for an individual user I will automatically get them sorted by time order um and then the rest of the fields things like completed I mentioned it was was a Boolean you know all the types of like Fields you could imagine that you might see in a relational database you'll you'll also see here as well then once I have this is by the way this is my um my physical data model here this is be the output of this right this is going to be where I'm going to eventually output then I can just translate that right into a cig table statement right so you'll notice I've got my cig table here's my table name here are the fields here are the types that coincides exactly with what's going on here the difference though is this primary key well I said user ID is my partition key so I'm going to say okay primary key here's my user ID in the PRS that I'm saying I'm partitioning by user ID and then comma everything after it's a clustering column and I said okay I have an item id here and I'm going to order by time right so I'm saying I want the to-do items table with these fields partitioned by user ID then ordered by Item ID and then result of that if you take a look down here at the bottom you can see in this query right where once I've implemented it I've inserted some data we're going to do this today by the way um then I'm going to look at all of the to-do items by user John and here they are they're going to be in time order and you can see the individual to-do items all right so that's essentially kind of a refresher of some of the stuff we did from last week now what we want to do is move it over to Mr Rags uh to bring you through uh get the database set up if you haven't done that ready and get our initial Astra instance uh going perfect um you guys can hear me just want to make sure yes we can hear you we can hear you yeah so so now is is the time if you miss the first two weeks uh you know you need a database to to do the end zone later so we will just take five uh to 10 minutes just to for everyone to have the database to be able to do the exercises yeah yeah so that's great and and my screen is being shared as well just to make sure um all right don't do anything bad don't do anything bad your screen no worries so so first let me let me make sure um you know for those of you who've already been to um um you know the two um weeks before um you know you probably have already created a database uh you probably already created the key space and all that so let me talk about that first so you're going to go back to the AST um you know dashboard right and and basically it's as dat stx.com or you can click on the link that's provided um you know in the YouTube if you go down you can you can see the AST link uh there are number of ways of getting here if you if you've already done this you probably know this right uh but if you look at your dashboard okay you will see that you know some of these might be in standby mode you now you see here these are in standby mode my only thing running right now is my workshops right so if you have already created this workshop's database what I suggest you do is you know just click on it and make sure that it goes active right um you know if you're active give us a thumbs up uh that that it's good to go right um and and you know if you want to take it one step further you can click on the database itself uh and make sure that this Todo keyspace exists okay um so all of this is in the U you know is in the instruction so so if you want to connect to your database you you want to make sure that this keyspace toos is active right so give us a thumbs up if you if you have done with that but for those of you who may have missed the first two weeks no sweat right again go back to the um you know to the GitHub repository okay um and go into week two data modeling or week one intro uh you know you can kind of look for it right and and basically the only thing you need to know is the database name and the keyspace name okay so this one is a little different chat SRA don't use that but use the todos okay and and and this will basically talk about I I believe the week two data modeling should cover that okay you'll see here the database name is workshop and the keyspace name is toos so how do I get there right so essentially again you're going to click on that Astro link right and and go there and then you're going to do this create database it might ask you you know why why am I going to be using my Astra and all that um and then you just click on the create database okay and put in the values for database name okay which is workshops okay and introduce again just follow the read me right you know I'm not going to do that because um you know I've already done this okay and and really you can you can pick a particular region okay I just picked the one that's you know closest uh to where I am so in this particular case I'm in North America so I pick North America and then I put this South Carolina I think we're consolidating regions a little bit now for those of you who might have used this before um you might be wondering you know why why are there not enough regions uh but if you want more regions more choices and all that uh you can definitely um you know uh either uh do a live chat and ask for it to be enabled uh or what you can do is you can put in your credit card um you know uh but the cool thing about you know using the free tier is that you get $25 every month and you can do some you can run some significant production workloads um you know not recommended but you know because you're doing it only in one region and all that right uh but but you know you can still um you know do fairly significant things without even putting your credit card all that you need is your email uh and and you're good to go um is there anything else I missed David or Cedric uh no reading the the the question and some some glitch here and there uh but you know yeah I think you are doing great all right so so at the at the end you know when you when you're going to get back here basically what you're going to see is you're going to be in a dashboard and you should see that you know workshops is up and running right it it basically is in active mode so if you want to start that you know go ahead and start that uh because the next um in the next exercise what we're going to do is we're going to download the credentials and start using it in git part um but but if you want to you know keep this active and every now and then you may want to get back here because what it does it times out uh so you may want to you know kind of keep an eye on it if you if you don't um you know if you want to um not get back to it and start it restart it again or relog in and all that okay so pretty much it uh with that you know should we proceed yeah let's do it I saw a set of thumbs up that came in and we could do that so Cedric then we'll go ahead and pop it back on over to Cedric for the next section sure and yeah look at that I'm big on screen yeah see I'm I'm fair about this okay I didn't just make make me in that in that spot there okay right so it will take a few minutes for the database to initiate or um get out of e Nation so this is uh you know enough time for us to let let's dig into coding okay so um let's pretend the database is ready today is all about building a back end so coding so what I will show you now is uh explain you all the principle what you should do at the application Level to connect to the database and then each time I will show you the sample code in the three languages JavaScript Java python even C okay and after explaining one on two principles we will go to Endzone and you will uh do the the the exercises with the language of your choice one of the three here okay so this session work with you know all the profiles javascri back end or front end JavaScript or Java everybody would be happy okay so let's get running uh next slide please all right so that's the big architecture diagram let's say the first two week we focused on the database tier okay the the the lane on the right we do have the database running today is all about the back end we will build something that will rely on the library called the driver to connect to gandra so first first disclosure F first things to know is to connect to um the database you need a driver the driver is a library that will uncode all the binary communication between your code and the database so you will see it expose what we call an API not rest API but napi in the sense of exposing some interfaces for you to use the database okay let's move on so the drivers can do a lot for you and if you know uh you are on the data STX developer YouTube channel if data STX is well known in the candra community is to provide all the drivers in multiple languages so here you see all the all the all the languages and all the features that you can find in this Library okay so not only you will connect and execute some queries pass the result and do some object mapping sure but you you do have way more like else check connection pulling reconnection retry load balancing else check everything is part of the driver so for some reason if one of the node goes down at the database level the driver will uh load balance for you on another node and you don't even notice so that's really really uh reliable and you know you have nothing to do at your end The failover will happen uh for you we won't cover all of those today don't don't worry we will do the create read update delete operations okay okay let's get running all right so I told you you need a single Library the driver here four ways to import the drivers B based on the language you are using so Java you can use Maven Gradle here I put the maven extract of pom.xml if you are using uh JavaScript and the node stack this is the npm uh command that we'll use if you are using this is the PIP command pip or pip three it's Python 3 and if using S up you the library are also available on nugget so single Library this is how to download it and make it available in your project all right with that library now available let's see what we can do so Cedric good question about connection pooling um you know what do you mean by connection pooling are you getting there or do you want to uh I I can talk quickly about it so uh uh the driver will maintain an active communication with every single now every single uh node okay uh and so you need to have a um a pool of active connection and if you know one connection goes down you need to have a pool available to open a new connection that's done at the driver level also when you do have a query to execute against uh your database uh you will pick one of the uh available thread in the pool to execute your query so a pulling at the for the connection and the pulling for the queries uh to execute yeah I think I think it's obvious but but you know one of the most expensive operations of database access is the connection right so you definitely want to do the connection pooling so that you know um uh you can you can optimize on that and and rather than you do it you let the platform for you that's right yeah and something to point out this is going to be uh I'm I'm purposely pointing out something for the homework and and such is think of all the capability that Cedric was talking about what drag just pointed out right and that is then being capsulated in your session object we'll talk more about that I don't want to take too much of sedc Thunder but something to uh keep in mind for some upcoming questions uh that's really important it's my foreshadowing that's my question foreshadowing okay uh speaking of connectivity connection so uh you we need to contact your database so you need to provide a IP address and a port so the port is uh on U you know which socket your database is listening for your connection default on candra 9042 never mind this is what we called a contact Point IP port only one is necessary because as soon as a driver is able to contact one node this node will communicate the IP and the port of everyone so the token will be aware of the topology of the cluster and with these first connection is now able to do all the balance load balancing and L check that that I've just told you about still it's a good practice to have at least in your um Connection in your setting three node per data center defined for the contact points why oh this is because at the first uh connection during application initialization if for some reason this very contact point is not available the driver will fail over to another one and with that you're totally sure that the application will start okay so what what does the code look like when with this contact point so let let's look on the next slide okay so here you go so as you can see here we will initialize an object very important object called the session so SQL session in the Java and uh client it's it's called a client in um in node it's you know session in in Java and python uh and C and um a client in node nevertheless you see what you need the contact Point IP and Port the keyspace name so here we will use to-dos user passw okay of course you don't want to let your database open and something called the local data center so if you recall uh week one we explained that Cassandra could live on multiple data center across the world uh so here we just tell the drivers hey this is the the data center that I will work to I would like to work with to reduce the latency and what will happen the driver will fail over to the next data center only if the local one fail uh that's um really for latency and performance reason okay but here um we are using a cloud service so the the database you just created is Astra Astra DB it's a software as a service uh uh and uh we cannot open the port like that 9042 for everyone it's not the way it's the way work you the web work you cannot really open this port you need to work through HTTP so to do so at Astra level we have designed and defined some proxies and load balance answer with no single point of failure and you will need at the driver level to add a zip file it's called the secure connect bundle the this dip file will contain everything you need to open a two-way TLS tunnel between you and the server to be able to do uh all the the communication keep the uh session open remember this session is state full to do the lse check and not balancing so in the endzone you will see that we will not provide contact point with IP and Port we will provide the credential user password we will provide a cloud secure bundle and we will uh provide the key space okay in asra the username is your client ID when you generate token and your password is client secret when you generate a token okay so what does the code look like with asra so let's move all right so here you see the uh new code and we switch from contact points with IP and port to with Cloud secure bundle and we just we provide the zip each time so no need to take a screenshot or not we you will get some help in the in the different End Zone see so each time you see a cloud field or a cloud property that is populated with the secure doz file that would be really mean of us to make them copy the stuff off the screen yeah yeah go back in time and copy paste all right go to go to time stamp uh you know uh 12 uh you know 12:47 or 47 minutes you know you know that that's funny but you know I remember one time I I did that you know just the the command to enter not as something you can copy paste but just an image for people to realize exactly what the Comm was doing so anyway um so these connection or client you will initialize with all the parameter I I share you again is the stateful object so it will open underhood a lot of multiple TCP socket one for each node so it should be unique in your application okay you create what we call a single ton and uh these SQL session is available across your application that also need you need to clean stuff a lot of TCP uh socket are open you want to close them properly right so at the end when you want to shut down your application you need to also invoke s session. close to properly uh close all these sockets all these man open TCP connections to do so uh we are using the pattern called the shutdown hook so shutdown hook as the name stated when you trigger a shutdown the hook will notice that a shutdown is happening and will execute some code and depending on which language you are using uh it's um you know those are different in Java the most uh the most I now you do java. getet runtime. shutdown hook or you can also use some spring mechanism um um when you when you close the application all righty so with that you should have everything you need to connect to the database so now I think I will angang over to rags for rags to expl explain uh how you create the database so now is the real deal you will have uh your stuff connected to your database Perfect all right rag you ready you got your uh setup going yeah I do thank you um all right let's get started again where do I start you know you started the uh GitHub repository just make sure uh you know you are in the week three app development right uh number of ways to get there okay and then um we're going to start right um I hope by this time you have created the Todo key space um and and and good to go if anybody needs help uh you know please let us know and we'd be glad to help okay if you don't have that you know you pretty much can't do anything you know in today's Workshop so so please get help if you if you you need it but again it's pretty straightforward what what you're doing is you're setting up a database and you're setting up a key space I know I saw a couple of questions um about you know not every region being available uh you know just just go ahead and use the uh uh Google Cloud um because I like I said you know we're trying to consolidate regions and maybe there are some issues uh but I think uh you know Google Cloud should be fine and it should work okay and notice that you know these um um uh you know some of these images are actually uh animated gifts so you know it kind of walks you through pretty extensively of how to do this um and and we are about to jump in um to start our Workshop okay uh so with that there was one question that uh maybe we can take after after I finish up all right so what I'm I'm going to do is again go back to my um Astra uh console dashboard whatever you want to call it right and and then what I want to do is uh you know again just follow these steps that are given here right so go to um um generate token that's the first thing you're going to do first make sure that it's active up and running right uh and then I'm going to go into organization settings and I'm going to go to token management and pick the RO database administrator and click generate a token right you know pretty straightforward so let me see if my organization settings are somewhere here right so click on organization settings okay and then token management okay and then um you know select a role you know you're going to select database administrator and then generate a token you know pretty straightforward okay so if you click on on this you will you'll get a screen you know I'm not going to create one more um but you will see a screen which kind of looks like this right and and essentially it'll let you in to the client ID the client secret and the token as you can see here right um the best way to to um you know kind of use this in your program um is to download this as a CSV uh and and and keep it handy because we're going to do that you know almost immediately okay so we're going to use that almost immediately all right so so client ID client secret and token is what you're going to need and you're going to download it as a CSV uh to recap what you're going to do is you're going to go to organization settings token management pick the RO database administrator and generate the token and then what you're going to do is you're going to um um essentially download it as a CSV and keep it handy all right right uh you could you could keep the application tab around but you typically what happens is um you know after a while it times out and and you're just going to run into some issues okay so I have my um you know a token um saved you know basically as a CSV file all right all right oh hey uh re uh Casey's asking if we can just slow down just a little bit okay let them catch up as a matter of fact maybe we can get to the next stopping point get some thumbs up and make sure folks are caught up with us H it's not a bad idea yeah why why don't we wait here for a little bit before I launch G pod right yeah I think we we can we can wait yeah just for everyone to have the the token and the database and you know yeah let's yeah as soon as we are in G pod you know we could as well go fast so yeah exactly exactly yeah yeah so once you get your token once you've got your token ready to go give us a thumbs up right let us know that you've got I saw paval download the CSV and Marcus there we go leas I hope I said that right um leas I I'll admit from from where I am in my part of the world I I felt so ignorant when I saw um Le's name last week because to me that's lies but that's clearly not how you pronounce it and so I was um I was I was schooled on the name I thought that was really neat and let's see some thumbs up if you're able to so yes the the the user you should uh the role you should pick is either administrator database or or administrator organization oh it's Le thank you Le thank you yeah thank you go ahead and open my good pod um yeah I mean I don't yeah I don't see why we're getting a good solid amount of Thumbs Up I it seems like some folks are still coming in give it a give it a couple of minutes yeah just give it another minute maybe yeah yeah you know I expect also a lot of people already have their DB running maybe they they do have to create a new token you know maybe they don't remember the the old one from last week uh I don't think they used it last week no maybe not oh did they oh right yeah that's right we didn't need them yeah we weren't hooking up with applications yeah so I think it's all net new token creation right now exactly exactly so this is a new um new Step so to say and believe me and these are the toughest Parts you know once you get this go it's once you're get part it's like you know it's pretty straightforward yeah and Casey um uh you just funny enough Casey just asked can you reuse the same one yeah you totally can um so toally if you've been with us before and you've already created a database token you could just reuse it the the reason why we're having you go through the step again just in case is if you didn't download the CSV or something if you don't have those credentials handy then you can just create another one right you can create n number of tokens um that's not an issue so but if you do have it Casey then by all means reuse it all right so let me go ahead and launch G part so what I'm going to do at this point is I'm going to hover over here and essentially the best way is to open the link in a new tab or open the link in a new window you know whatever whatever suits your fancy or if you want to just copy the link and put it in a different browser there are a number of different ways of doing this because essentially what you're going to be doing is you're going to be using gitpod and you're going to be using this uh instructions in the git uh GitHub repository and usually it's it's nice to kind of keep them separate right so when you when you um open this link in new tab or open link in new window you it will take a little bit of time and you will see something like this okay so I have this in a different uh tab oh so Rex just so you know when you go to that other tab I don't know it looks like the top of your screen's a little cut off so I don't actually see multiple tabs yeah I just see you flip from one to the other oh okay okay um but no no worries yeah I mean yeah can you see it now all right yes yes now I can see it yeah okay so I'll leave it like that for a little bit okay so essentially what what you can do is you know you can click on this and if you say open link in new tab you're going to get a new tab if you open link in new window you're going to get the new window and so on so you know um pretty straightforward right and uh real quick RS W uh asks a really good question is it a token per database or a token per User it's a token per user so you could potentially with a single token use that across your databases right um one thing that we recommend though is if you have multiple applications is you create a token per application right that way from a logging perspective security perspective right if you ever need to revoke a token you're not revoking it for everything across the board you're you're revoking it for that one one applic but it is per user thank you for asking that and uh the secure connect bundle is per uh database correct um data center if your database do have multiple region you will have one secure bundle per region good point okay yeah but I kind of assume that it's per database and just you know just just to be safe right you know I just go yeah I mean yeah you are safe because we will work with the single region but you know Astra allow to create multiple regions so you can have the same database living in in you know region USA and region you know EMA and asra will do the replication in two ways for you yeah no this is great because you know even though I'm I'm doing this Workshop I'm learning as well um so this this fantastic uh the idea is to uplevel everybody's skill all right so let me proceed uh hopefully you have G part running leave it leave it running for a little a little bit uh and should we get some thumbs up before I proceed with the next step because you got to have Gart running so if you have G pod running please put a thumbs up in the chat y y y we'll give it a couple of time if you have if you're having difficulties please let us know we'd be happy to help um perfect Tupa cool it's coming yep they are coming it's coming through we love G pod it's it's amazing so you do have an ID in the cloud okay fine if you look here in the terminal you can do no GS uh python Java uh you can do doer as well and you have nothing to install that's just amazing you have all the extension from VOD or at least a right range of extension you know for us doing Labs that just amazing yeah no I mean I I can't talk enough about G pod and and you know let you in a secret we are going to have a data data stack Astra plugin which is not fully functional right now but but it's still going to be available for you you know if you want to play around with it play around and give us some feedback but what we have done is we have also integrated the SQL console here okay so if you do a select star from to-do items okay and I'm jumping ahead a little bit here I know but uh you will you will see that everything is in gitpod so you don't even need to leave git part which schol and and that's the reason why we kind of Rave about it yes so and for those who asking it's not exactly the same screen when you startup GB this is probably because Rags already open one of the source code yeah I think I think Rags is already in a a running G pod do rags do you have do you have a brand new one or just the running one yeah let me get rid of this uh I could definitely bring up another one what's the big deal I mean just just open the read me because now people just have the read me open so just okay so let me talk about G part yeah good good question uh good point so now you know uh getting familiar with gitpod is probably a good idea so take take some time um you know even if it's like five minutes two and a half minutes whatever uh you know the case may be um you will see you know like um you know what Cedric was saying uh there are three parts really that we'll be um kind of interacting with if you will um the left part is what is referred to as the file explorer you know that's the typical file explorer like you know we already mentioned this is Visual Studio code in the cloud right in in a browser um so the file explorer window is on the left you can always bring that up uh by clicking on the hamburger menu and saying file explorer and I'll show show that to you uh this is the editor window U so number one number two and number three is the terminal window or gitar terminal that's what we call it or gitar CLI whatever you want to call it um that window and and we'll primarily be shuing the commands um you know through window number three okay um window number two is for editing window number one is for kind of exploring uh what's in the um uh in in the repo right so as soon as you click on that particular link what it does is it clones the repository and and essentially what it does is it it provides you with a view to the repository you can do get pushes from right there obviously you can't do a git push into the repository that you're are cloning because you don't have permissions uh but if you want to you know kind of fork it yourself and then use git pod you can do that there are ways of doing that okay so if you want to get to the file explorer view you can just click on the hamburger and then say View and then Explorer and you can always get that back okay um at the top right of the window there is a plus sign which allows you to create multiple shells so again kind of familiarize yourself with it um sometimes you might see this um can I uh is it okay to um copy images to the clipboard you know just say hello and and you're good um yeah something to point out about that that little dialogue that'll happen the first time you try to paste something into G pod uh so if there's code or anything and it sometimes that dialogue is hard to see and it might you might not notice it wondering why can't I paste so if you cannot paste make sure you're looking for that little dialogue that Rags has shown you exactly uh we're not going to open any ports today so not not to worry about it but but you know next week we're going to open up ports and we'll we're going to go through that later uh we usually get this um you know question so we are trying I'm trying to preempt this uh is how can I set my preferences right so just go to gear. preferences after you're logged in and you can pick you know the different themes light dark system and so on okay all right so now comes the setup for the application are you guys ready yes oh all right and this is the part this is the cool part because Cedric already mentioned this um you know it doesn't matter what driver you're using uh because it's really based on the data center right so whether you're using nodejs um python or Java it doesn't matter uh we're going to use that uh in a second so how do I do that right again go back to the console okay and go back to the dashboard I'm just going to go back to the dashboard okay this is where my dashboard is right go to workshops okay and just hit the connect part right and then you will Connect using a driver you'll see that on the left left right or Connect using an API um um but here's the driver part okay and really you can pick any of these it doesn't matter because we know now that it's really based on the data center right so so you can pick python you can pick Java you can pick C you can pick C++ it doesn't really matter okay so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to click on the download bundle and basically click on the secure connect bundle okay and what it's going to do is it's going to download it um locally you can see here secureconnect workshops. zeep right um so it's downloaded locally there are a number of ways of putting it into gitar eventually we have to get it into git part right uh but the easiest way of doing this is probably this you know what what I'm going to show in in the next few steps okay so I'm going to exit the full screen mode okay and I'm going to go into my finder window okay so here's my finder window and you'll see here the secure connect workshops. zip right I'm going to go to my gitar tab okay go back to my founder window and all that I'm going to do is it take this and drop it here okay so just make sure that you're dropping it in the right directory okay uh and all of that you know they um you know is uh you walk through that um you just need to put it in the home directory and and you should be good okay so you'll see here you will see my secure connect workshops. zip is in the top level directory okay uh and and just to make sure that you you did it correctly um we have a way you know to to verify this just go to you know LS just do LS minus L of the um secure connect workshops okay and you should be able to see it okay can you show uh San's asking uh Rags if you can show how you got to the dashboard there in Astra just maybe go through that process real quick again sure okay so so you know you basically hit on dashboard okay or if you have already gone through the organizations you can just go back uh you know keep going back until you hit this dashboard right so hit the dashboard okay and then pick the database that you're interested in that you want the secure connect bundle for okay and then hit the connect and believe me this is the toughest part of the workshop after that things will be very straightforward right so hit connect right and essentially what you can do is you can click on the um bundle okay so so you have the zip file and once you have the zip file then what you can do is you can put it in get part okay and you can see here I have the secure connect Workshop starts it okay so if you go back here I believe it's here so I'm just going to cut and paste it you can see here um secure connect workshops. zip right and basically it's about 12K which tells you that you've you've correctly installed it okay and and something to point out everything that Rags is doing is in the readme right these steps are in the readme uh so if you ever need to you can always go back and reference that and you can see the steps there yeah exactly exactly right okay so let me go through uh a little bit more okay um now you're are going to get into you know the zip file is needed for all the workshops so I just put it in the home directory but there are certain things that we probably won't needed for the you know next week uh but but this is the right time to get into next I mean uh this week okay so to do that all that you're going to do is you're just going to say CD and week three right Apple again you know these were um instructions are right there okay and the first time around you will you will see your EnV file is not there okay uh it it'll look something like this you know env. sample where you have to put the Astra username name and the Astra password right this is from from the U you know the CSV file that we did just a moment ago right so basically what you're going to do is you're going to pick the username which is the client ID and the Astra password which is the client secret okay so let me see if I have it and I can show you really quickly if I have it so here's my my token here's my you know this is the CSV file that I have so take my client ID okay and then the client secret okay and and basically what you're going to do is you're going to paste it into the gitar terminal okay and let me go back into full screen mode here right and and you're going to paste it here okay the username and the password so maybe we should pause a little bit at this point you know so that everybody yes also yeah people really looking for this ZIP file yeah yeah yeah that's what I'm typing that one right there okay yeah and Rags if you wouldn't mind can you pop over to the readme real quick um because I noticed uh looking at Pav's comment um right where is right uh let's see oh wait let's see we want to go to the spot uh with the ls command where you're doing an LS against the bundle there you go okay thank you yeah you see that paval um where where it says expected output yeah don't copy that you just want to you just anything that says expected output that is what you should see just ignore them yeah yeah that's just the output you should see if you copy that that's not going to work in a in a prompt in a command yeah I know sometimes it's easy to you know just cut and paste but but you know if you if you see the expected output you know just ignore that right yeah the expected output is just so you can you can verify what you're seeing in your console that's not meant for you to copy yeah as a matter of fact I just realize Rags if you hover over the expected output did you do that as a code block because it'll have a copy widget in it and so I could yeah I wonder if people are thinking they have to copy it yeah yeah it's because it's a code block that's all it's not actually meant for you to copy exactly right yeah all right should we uh wait for some thumbs up uh for those of you who have been able to um get giod up and running uh and not only that be able to download the zip file into gitpod right um put it in gitpod uh and and make sure that's about 12K size uh or or is that you know I know it's going to take a while but but you know this is a very critical step I see fedo is good can we see a few more thumbs up okay can good gell is that how you pronounce it oh tyan has a a double thumbs up so maybe he's put the Astro username and password too in there maybe that's what it means all right so should I proceed I think we have few thumbs up right um yep all right we do so so then what you're going to do is you're going to open the EnV okay I'm not going to show all that because um you know um the instructions are pretty explicit uh you open the EnV copy the username and the password and then run this command called plug asttr creds okay and then do a g Def and I'm going to I'm going to show you the G diff part of it okay so essentially what you're going to do is you're going to copy the env. sample that we provided with the Astra username and password not provided right and then you're going to add the username and the password which is the client ID and the client secret from the spreadsheet right that you downloaded earlier and then run this command plug asro credits because what it's going to do is it's going to plug in the username and passwords to the different languages you know everything is going to be done for you right um and what I'm going to do show here is the output of all that I'm going to just do a get diff okay and you'll see here you know essentially you will see my you know username from username whatever the username password um on on the different you know this one is uh I believe the um nodejs driver and then the python driver all right yeah and just something to point out real quick you do not need to put your username and password in quotes right you can just copy them lit literally as they literally just like that yeah good point yeah yeah oh hurry um for the export piece so um that is coming out of the example section probably for one of the apis um rexs would you mind pulling up uh your your EnV file so they can see an example yeah right the export so what when you go to thei section and Astra uh instead of drivers it's actually giving you uh export commands that you could use in your terminal to set up uh variables to just use with apis you don't need to put the export so if you take a look at rag screen right there okay um oh you're doing you're setting up a script aren't you yeah I'm setting it up myself yeah ex my bad my bad okay so so if you do the open you know copy it just like that okay and if you do the open EnV it should have the username and the password okay and the username is your client ID and the password is is your client secret Cent secret yeah we not going to use the token the asro token sometimes we use the asro token you know depending on the use case uh but in this particular case we're not okay yeah uh and again you know if I if you if you want me to show one example of this let's see the ex6 connect to Astro Java right and what this is going to do is it's going to use uh a um database connection and if you go to database connection contion you know it automatically sets this up you know the connect bundle the username the password and all that okay you don't have to do anything all right all right let's see some thumbs up for those of you who are able to you know plug in one other thing I probably forgot to mention is if you go to um zshell the um zshell right then essentially it's going to take a little bit of time which is a good sign because what it's doing is it's connecting to SQL uh using the username and the password okay so um you know if you see something like this you know with a SQL sh that means you're good to go okay uh which means it set up the username and the password and all that uh and and you're good to go okay so you can do something like uh use toos right and uh you know select star from too items okay and uh drop I'm going to drop this I'm going to be brave right too too items all of this you know SQL um what did I do wrong I just do to-do items is it drop table okay drop yeah this this takes a little bit of time the drop table uh but but don't be too concerned about it okay oh U all right let me go back to this okay so it's it's probably already done sometimes you do get that uh uh timeout that I've seen so all right so can we get a thumbs up of when you guys are able to um you know uh kind of look at the SQL shell and uh um user ID user is a client ID um okay yeah I do see some thumbs up but you know I will say for the folks for the amount of folks that we have on and the amount of thumbs up I saw before I only we should probably wait a little bit for some more folks yeah yeah I agree okay there's I'm just going to keep saying your name CU I want to get into my [Laughter] brain see can Le win uh one of the swags some some week I remember so but but hopefully you're getting ready for for two days all right so we seeing some thumbs up if you're stuck please let us know because uh believe me this is the toughest part of the whole boot camp series as strange as it may seem wait for next week no just [Laughter] kidding yeah what's really cool about this process by the way I was you know when I was going through these myself I was I was impressed with how you did it Rags because when you run that one script it'll autop populate all three languages for you so you have examples in all of them right the cool thing to to RX the point once you once you get that ID the secret and your secur connect bundle that's it right that it'll handle all of the connectivity to your Astro cluster it does it over SSL it's secure all that um and the the joke I kind of like to make but it's actually real for especially for Java folks if you've ever had to code up SSL before it is such a pain you don't have to do any of that here it's literally all encapsulated in the secure connect bundle so you just need those three things right the client ID the client secret and your secure conect bundle across any of the languages and the rest of it is all completely being handled for you all right I see a lot more thumbs up coming in okay I think I think we're looking a little better all right so so let me proceed then all right um so where was I um I think we are ready to do c and Cassandra uh cred stands for create read update delete right so the the first thing you're going to do and this is probably going to be you know especially for those of you who are undecided you may have to pick one of these again it doesn't matter you know you can mix and match them but I think it's easier just to stick with one if you can okay uh and all of them work pretty much uh uniformly so the first thing you want to do is make sure that you set up the Astro username password and the secure connect zip uh and and now you're good to go so I'm just going to pick node just because I like it right uh I didn't want to do that yeah all right so let me pick node which is exercise 6 6f in JavaScript okay and now I'm good to go with node all right so all that I'm going to do is again follow the steps uh but what I would urge most of you to do is take a moment to understand um because you know there's a lot of code that that is there okay so essentially what I'm doing is I'm going to the JavaScript directory which is really what nodejs is right um and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a connection to the um Astra that we just created right so this is just a simple connection I'm just going to run this right uh we set up all the drivers for you automatically when you brought up gitpod uh I can I can you know we can we can talk about that but but really you know um I already looked at uh you if you want to make sure that your username and password is set up um maybe a good idea to to do this once okay just do a quick get diff and you'll see that you know the username and passwords have been changed and all that and and enabled and and and good to go you will do the same thing in in Java and uh uh python you know um so now the first thing we're to do do is establish connectivity right so how do I establish connectivity for each of the language a little bit different but essentially what you're going to do is you're going to just run the so it starts the exercise and basically it tells me that I am now connected to the Astra whatever that name is uh at whatever region this is and again go back going back to um you know where you created it you know you created it Us East one and and I'm connected um and and good to go okay so at this point I've really all that I've done is I've established the connection what I suggest you do is basically look at this JavaScript driver right and and you know essentially it it basically you know you know if you remember um we did a connection right so it requires the connection um so what you can do is you can take a look at the connection. JavaScript okay it has the username password and all that right and then what I do is I create the Cassandra provide the secure connect bundle the username the password and so on and on exit I want to make sure that I clean up everything and I'm good to go right so let's go back and look at this JavaScript and all that I do is execute the command uh select star from system. loal um and essentially what I'm doing is I'm picking up what cluster name it is and what data center it is you know pretty straightforward right um if you do the same thing in Java it it's more or less the same okay uh so I can I can show you the um you know the command for running it in Java okay and and why not right so if you go to Java little bit different but you know there is a little bit more setup with Java because you have to do a clean compile okay and then then you have to connect to it okay I've I've done all this so let me go into Java right so make sure first thing you need to do is make sure in Java subd directory right so let me do a clear okay and then what I can do is I can I can test this connect to Astra okay and hopefully keeping fingers crossed right it does the same thing right you know it locates the connect bundle uh connects to Astra connect with the key space and you're good to go okay so now since I'm in Java let me continue to do that right um let me go back to uh I can create a table right so if I go back to um my um yes yeah so R we do have a question somebody just closed the terminal quickly so maybe you can just show the hamburger to create a new terminal in git pod oh yeah okay so basically you can Klick on hamburger okay and View and just say terminal okay and you should be getting that again okay so same thing with Explorer with terminal you know you can do anything you want by the way real real quick um real quick Rags I think there are a couple folks that are stuck on the secure connect bundle I think from what I'm seeing in the messages they may have put the bundle in the incorrect place um it might be worth um yeah okay to that uh TF TF you don't want the secure connu bundle file to be inside the the language directory like python or JavaScript it actually should be at the root um of the project itself um which is the week three app development directory then it will be available to all of them right so as a matter of fact what step is that um that is at ah yeah it's step 5c step 5c make sure that you're performing the the CD the change directory week three app development once you're there um then that's where you can drag and drop your security connect bundle into that directory and I don't know if ragy wasn't looking at your screen no it is uh what I did here is you know if you think you dropped it in the in the wrong place uh what you can do is you can just do this find slw workplace minus name uh workshop. ZIP uh and and you will see here you know that I'm I'm in this right directory like in Workshop full stack apps with Cassandra okay uh if it's in a different subdirectory you'll have to just copy it from there okay just make sure um it goes in here or another way of working with this is you know if you look at connection. JS right um essentially what it does is it it uses this particular um path okay you can change that path as well so there are a number of ways of kind of dealing with it if you have dropped it into the wrong uh directory okay all right so should I proceed or what should we do I think we can help some of those folks in the chat there um okay yeah I think we yeah would because we need to move on time wise we can just help them in the chat okay perfect all right so so let me go back to my um SQL shell here okay and let me do a select star from to do I items uhhuh okay am I using to this let me make sure okay and if I do a select star from to-do items nothing is there which is actually good because we haven't created the table yet right so let's go back and create the table and again just refer to the instructions right so the first thing we're going to do is create the table right so um let's let's create the table by doing this you know and this is going to be probably um similar you know with python with nodejs something along these lines right you know just follow the instructions and my apologies I'm hitting the wrong one here okay and I'm just going to go ahead and create the table okay okay cool in Java right and just because I can I will go ahead and insert it in Python right okay and hopefully it should it should um oh it's not a good sign timed out okay so let me try again okay sometimes like I said I know I've seen this timeout very rarely uh okay thankfully that worked okay now I can go back here okay and now I should be able to see um the items that have been in uh or the table that has been created right there is nothing in there yet right it's just that the table has been created right now what I can go and do is again you know you can pick your own path you can do whatever you want okay but what I'm going to do is I'm going to insert todos using python okay so I'm going to go here python okay and they're all pretty much the same okay so here is the insert too spy right so I'm going to um and and again you don't need to do any of this you know the uh if you go back to python so if I go to python okay and you see the insert tables right um create table exactly the same way and then I insert the um toos okay so I'm going to go ahead and insert the toos okay let me bring this up okay and I can do insert too okay and let's see what happens here okay so basically I got a success right and if I go back to my and one of the nice things I like about you know the SQL shell is you can do the clear okay if I do a select star from too items what do you you guys think will happen you know you should be able to see the um items that are inserted that Mak sense and you can pick and choose um I think we established connectivity uh we started doing some exercises uh you know maybe jumped ahead a little bit uh but but you know um but at this point let's go back to the presentation um if if you guys are good with the secure connect bundle and and kind of familiar with Git pod uh and be able to navigate that U give us a thumbs up good cool yeah and you know um I would do a few slides and you know you can jump in the chat rags and see you know some some of the that people might get but yeah it's a lot related to secure Bund all righty all right so I do see I'm trying to send some folks over to the Discord by the way if you are having a hard time with a secure connect mle thing come to Discord give us a screenshot it should help us a lot um but in most cases if it's not finding that it it's just in the wrong place so like I said come over to Discord give us a screenshot and I'll try to help you out while Cedric is talking here yeah yeah exactly I think you know you you see the three of us plus Alex and and and Stefano weling in the in the chat so we we will make it we will make it okay all right so um now hopefully you were able to to connect to Kasandra Astra and create the table so see it was not required to be there week one and week two because with these two exercise we did we did it all for you so now let's put some data in this table so uh no surprise to uh communicate with the database you will need some queries okay in the database World any queries is called a statement okay and in the with the candra drivers any query you will execute will be under the hood converted into a statement and a statement it's just way more than just a string so and you can see that on the next slide and no David could you please move to the next slide yeah there you go sorry answering something I could share okay no problem uh okay okay so simply put a statement uh with have some metadata no just before yeah here we go uh so simple statement will have some some metadata so that's one one thing and also in a statement you do not want to write your queries as a single string like the first one select star from T1 what C1 equal 5 that's not great you do not want to put the values of the parameters in the queries why uh for all the what we call cql uh injection so somebody uh may want to instead of putting five insert some malicious code here uh that would be wrongly interpreted by your program and do some some weird stuff because you would know that this is how you implemented your queries what you want to do is to put some placeholder so C second line C1 equal interrogation mark okay and just below we have ADD position value so now the parameter is provided as an object and as such the driver could validate that it is uh the expected object validate some rules uh and you know execute and execute the query build the query for you it could be a question mark you can also provide some names in your parameter so line three here the parameter is called my Val and just below you see that we provide the value five for my Val so all three expression are the same one two three but two and three are way better in quality and security performance would be the same for now okay so this is how you provide parameter so next slide let's see how you could do that on the other languages so Java cover just to have a deep dive and in the node the parameter will be as an array uh second parameter in the execute method uh same for python okay and uh for C is very very close from uh the Java 1 okay so in each time it's just session. execute if you want to go Asing asynchronous you do have uh session. execute I think if you want to go reactive uh in Java it's available you can do session. execute reactive so that's pretty powerful you can be synchronous asynchronous reactive all right so more with those statements uh you know the first well C called simple statement this is because we can do better what we want to do is what we call prepare the statement at your application uh loading initialization you want to do sis. prepare as here in the in the Java code it will validate your queries it will check that the table exist that the colon exist the grammar is correct we'll create a single unique ID and store this unique ID both on server side and client side okay then when you execute any query you can do prepare. bind and just provide the parameters here only the parameters will be sent to the server and you will gain uh some pretty significant performance because now on the wire you do not send the full query but only the parameter the query has already been validated uh so you can expect just with that like 20% of uh performance increase just with that and that's the order uh of of of boost that you can have but just by thinking of preparing a statement you do have this boost also prepare once execute many times so now it will be validated once and you can execute multiple time so prepare uh so prepare that um have the same on python uh on node you have to provide U an object the option object with the attribute prepare as true and uh for C again very close to uh the Java one putting some uh capital letter in the first name of the method but that's exactly the same if you look session. prepare and you get prepare. bind so that's exactly the same code which is neat so please think about preparing your statement if you know in advance what your query will look like if your query is dynamic you can fall back to the s simple statement all right so now you execute your statement what you will get as a result is surprise a result set okay in this result set two big part first part and is all the metadata how much time does my query take what is the log uh got all the execution info is it successful not successful well if it's not successful you will get an exception but at at least you would get some statuses uh what were the node invoked and uh all the kpi you may want to save later in your dedicated analytics server but that's provided for you at the driver level your job to publish that on an external tool and then obviously your data your data is provided as an iterator it's not a list Cassandra will store you know millions and billions of record in the single table so this is the kind of database you do not want to do find all so for performance reason you will do full scan cluster remember we one and two but also you will get a lot of java object so best case scenario you uh explor your own application without of memory worst case scenario there is an impact on the candra Node because you want to put too many things in memory that won't happen all the queries in Cassandra are paged the default P page size is 5,000 and so when you navigate through the result set if you uh reach the last item of the page one under hood um the driver will keep fetching the page for you so if you do find a rs. all it will uh get the next page for you so the the recommended PA is to put the page Styles you need R retrieve only the item you need save the state and later when you need page two execute the query providing now uh the the status what we call the paging State okay so here what to remember any single query is page default page side is 5,000 and you can now yeah indeed switch to the code and see that it's quite the same uh for any result so you will get result set in Java in C and Python and yeah you get the cost not strongly typed love notes JavaScript uh you know getting better with typescript but here it's it's a yeah it's a n so you can have the first uh and if you um reach the last of the first page you keep going it's like a cursor in a way you know not the the analogy is not the best but this is how you need to think about it not everybody not everything is written on the first scod all right so keep moving so next slide please passing the rows so you get a list of something uh page okay you got it uh and this something is a row so a row is uh you know like kind of a ash key value key value key value the key would be the name of the colum and the value the value because in a Cassandra table you can have what we call sparse stable so that mean in the row not all the colon would be populated it's totally cool to have some some null or empty values unet in some of the values right so when you get the row you will retrieve um each column with row go dot get depending on the type you want to to reach so get type get double get integer get uu ID whatever and you will get the expected variables and here in Java we put VAR yeah we are already in GDK 13 yeah let's you know put strain here okay um all right so for the node you can see that um you in the row you can uh work as a gon object row. username because this is how Java JavaScript J and object notation work in Python you get as well the index notation r. username that works and uh last but not least C always uh pretty close from java here you go R.G value uh use the the templates string to get a string uh that name username and you back get your value and this is exactly what you will do in the next exercises okay wow that's quite some stuff last piece but not the least is uh it's good to retrieve a row but hey maybe you do not want to uh for each row retrieve uh each colon one after the other you would like to do object mapping you create an object having all the attributes you expect mapping all the column in your table and then you define a mapper once and with this mapper you would be able not to retrieve a list of objects a list of rows but a list of the expected object so that's pretty neat doing the mapping from the row data row r a w this time row data up to the object and see you see three ways to do it so Java Python and node but again uh Rags will show you in the very last uh example how to implement those and those will be used as is uh in week four uh just to expose an API uh to to have all the to-do uh items because an API needs some kind of objects and with that uh you should be ready to uh execute your first query is against your database so now time to go back to enzone and hope you catch up with some uh error you might have before all right uh I know that some of you are experiencing some frustration but but you know again you know you you can you can just follow through the read me um several times you know when I'm attending workshops I've fallen behind but you know a week give you enough time to catch up so there's plenty of time to catch up no big deal uh and again we wanted to keep the um the material in today's Workshop uh to a point where you can you can start running these programs okay um and and you know once you have one running really you know after that it's it's it's pretty straightforward I know there was a question about um U ID Wendy I think wday is that how you say that um you know it's probably best to take it on discard okay because I think it may be a little bit more involved than what we think it is so so we already saw you know a little bit um of of how this works right um you know I think I think uh um you know cedri talked about how you um get the different roles probably the best best uh place to get started is get all todos okay and uh let's keep it simple let's go to um JavaScript okay um so essentially what we are doing here is we are executing the statement right we are getting everything from too items where user ID is John and again we have violated a lot of the Cardinal rules that you know we say you should obey you know like putting the username the password you know in in Java file probably not a good idea but you know the idea again here is to keep it simple and and get you up and running as quickly as possible right uh so you know again select star from Todo items where user ID is equal to John is probably okay but a select star from Todo items may not be a good idea but but you know keeping that aside essentially what you're going to do is you're going to get back a row or rows right and essentially what you're going to do like what Cedric said is iterate through each of the rows and that's why you have the iterator right so you go one to the next to the next to the next until there is no more right that's typically How We Do how you work and one of the nice things about the iterator it kind of keeps track of where you are you know so that you can pick up from wherever you you know you you left it last right so with that said there is um you know let's look at this get get all to-dos in Java and what I'm going to do is you know there are a number of different ways of doing this right you know getting the um uh the different toos right and and here you know there's a simple statement Builder and and before that there is a create SQL uh session and then you prepare um you know you you basically get back what is refer to as a result set and essentially what you're going to do is again you're going to walk through the result set one at a time and then you're going to display it right but there are times when you probably don't want to treat that as a row but you would rather treat that as an object and that's where the object mapper comes in right omm or object relational mapping is a big Topic in itself okay I'm not going to go through all of them but the idea is that you know you take a relational object and turn it or a relational uh take a relational data okay or a row and turn it into an object okay so there are a number of different ways of doing this here I'm showing it being done manually um you know if you use some other platforms they automatically do this for you but essentially what I'm doing here is I get this result set back and what I do is I turn it into what is referred to as a array list okay or a list uh you know again a list is a list of items as it says right and then what I do is for each of those items I convert it into an object I take the string put it in user ID user uu ID string Boolean and so on okay and then for each of these too item I basically print out the title okay so keep keep track of this right you know we have uh Mary John John and we have attend the workshop walk the dog have lunch tomorrow whatever right and what we what we're going to do is we're going to take a look at how to run this right so let me go back to Java okay but really doesn't matter you can run it anywhere right and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to run the um appropriate command for for this right so so let me go back to my Java make sure I'm in Python here right so go back to Java okay and I'm going to get all to-dos okay so there's a create table there is insert to-dos and now I'm going to get all toos right so if you open this it will kind of walk you through it and I'll show you this how how it works okay so I just do open and that's exactly what it did you know it opened up this okay and if I remove this then it'll okay so it'll open open me the appropriate file and how do I run that again you know go back to your read me and run the instruction right so all that I'm going to do is I'm going to run this okay and again fingers crossed we'll see it's only looking for John's tasks okay and and that's why I gave the walk the dog and have lunch tomorrow right yes and then there's other tasks as well and then the final thing is this object mapper the simple object mapper and here what it did is it created the object mapper and for some reason it's not working and I'll have to look look through that I'll have to figure that out but essentially what it should do is is it should give you the um you know the uh um the different uh tasks so I I think what what I might have missed is that this is an iterator and the iterator has already been set uh but but essentially you should be able to see the tasks that are associated uh in terms of the object MPP so maybe we should we should set this as a homework you know for you guys to fix this right uh but but you know the object mapper part is still valid uh and and you know if everything were to be working correct then you would see all the different titles okay and and just something to point out I mean for the exercises here in this part obviously we're just have you doing you know wrote copies right and and you run the thing we really encourage you check out the code look at the implementation look at what it's doing right um because this if you've not communicated with you know a database or Cassandra before in code this will give you the the basic template if you will that you need to do that in the language of your choice um so so we definitely encourage you to actually take a look and kind of understand you know what's going on with the code which will help you with some of the homework absolutely yeah yeah so so if you take for example this particular uh insert todos right pretty straightforward right you know I mean it it it's pretty obvious what it's doing right it's basically inserting into too items the user ID of John user ID of John user ID of Mary um and then the item id uh and then you know whether it's completed is true false true and so on walk the dog have lunch tomorrow and so on and so forth okay so with that said let me show you one last part which is my homework okay I'm not going to show you the code for that okay because I want you guys to work on it okay but but essentially what I've done is I've created a very simple uh transfer to-dos okay and and the idea behind this transfer to-dos is you take all the toos and transfer it to me and I'll I'll take care of that right so again let's look at what are all the too items right so these are all the different Todo items and what I'm going to do is I'm going to transfer these to rags how do I run this yes you guessed it I just run the transfer to this.p okay and and let's see what happens here okay so so basically it's transferring as you can see Rags Rags rags and all of them are set to false as you can see see here okay so if I go back here okay and if I do the select start from to-do items whilea you should have three more items and all of those are assigned to me okay you can remove the Mary John and John if you want but you know just for Simplicity all that you need to do is create this uh but you know critical part is that you the completed should be false right and and you're good to go and and you have everything you know I myself I'm not like uh a big Guru on python but I use the use the um the different exercises that are there in that particular directory and kind of Cobble them together because that's kind of what programming is all about right it's really about taking those building blocks and kind of putting it together to make it happen yeah and I can't tell you how many times writing applications especially if you're new to a particular database or new to a language like the hardest part is getting the initial Plumbing configured right between what your application is doing in the database layer and yeah there's documentation and things like that but having it kind of like here here they are his working code blocks is like extremely useful because you can just take it and kind of modify from there yeah yeah yeah and I know that you know I mean in two hours you might think that you know you should be able to get along further but but you know believe me it's taken me a long time and and I I'm I'm pretty familiar with this so uh we have tried to keep the instructions as clear as possible but again you know we' be happy to get your uh comment make make it make it easier uh in the subsequent iteration but with that said uh anything else I missed uh Cedric or David no I think I think it's time to get over uh to do our swag quiz and everything and if you didn't get through everything right now that's totally fine right this the what what Rags has brought you all through is actually part of the the homework right so for those of you who are going to do that then um you can just continue that on uh and you will need to uh do a little bit of work for the for the actual homework from the uh the Google form uh and and code as well so I think we're good from that standpoint not only that something else I'd like to encourage all of you to do you might have the language of your choice but if you're looking to it at all kind of like look at other languages um it's kind of fun to go through like python I'm I'm more of a Java JS person actually I haven't done a ton on python so I find it I found it a little fun to go through the python code and kind of like figure that out and work with it a little bit um to get me more familiar there so it's all the languages are there uh you can easily switch between them um with the exercises so encourage you to check yeah and and that is why I took this you know this task to kind of do it in Python because you know and that's the one language I was not familiar with and and and it did take me some time but but I was able to finally get it going exactly okay so with that who wants to win some swag well before we do the swag um rag you want to say something about the homework here uh that is on the screen yeah so I already showed this to you in action but but essentially this is what you want to do right you know you have the the different to-do items did you give them the answers you totally gave the answers I I did not give them the answer no because you have to write you have to write the code though right uh but but you know if you're looking for if you're looking for the output this is how it should be okay so what you would you would do is possibly write this this program that I didn't really quite walk through you know excg transfer todos that I ran uh and and kind of gives you an idea of how exactly it's supposed to work okay all righty awesome now with that now let's move into the quiz I forgot that I forgot that Rags wanted to do that part all right so let's go back to menty and I will give everybody a moment as usual now you should already be in uh but if you're not go ahead and take a moment to get back over to menty so this is for swag quiz got to finish up the day here and here we go get everyone back in right got now I'm going to I'm going to wait for folks I'm going to put this back in we have some fun music that's right oh good all right I think we have it looks like we got about 60 people in I think that's pretty good so here's the trick with this right your quizzes are timed the the speed in which you answer matters so you need not only be correct but you also have to answer fast um so sometimes we throw a little curveballs at you so be careful that but look at your phone there's always going to be a slight amount of latency between um what we're doing in YouTube and stuff so make sure you're watching your phone for the questions just in case there's a lot of lag in your stream okay with that let's go ahead and get into our first swag wi question how many cql session objects should you use in your application one per connected client one per application as many as are needed there are no limits to the amount of memory my app can [Music] use I wish that was true right come on please have these correct at least come on I don't know if they get it wrong we can blame Cedric let's just blame Cedric exactly oh it's everywhere but yes it's one per application one for application that's a key thing now Cedric alluded to this earlier the cql section objects and actually rag said the same thing they're they're there's a lot going on with each individual cql session object right you have connection pools you maintain your cluster connection metadata to your cluster all that stuff is happening in that session object you only ever need one per application right um because if you duplicate these you're just that that's why we have the little joke there at the end there are no limits to the amount of memory in my app can use um because those session objects they're expensive right so you only ever need one per application that's all you need all right so let's see what our leaderboard looks like oh I see Le is up on the board again I want to take every every opportunity I can to say Lisa's name and Mark with the fastest response awesome at the top spot right now John in number two Le in number three rags is that you are you playing today Rags I'm playing I I can never you know match speed what do you guys think Rags is playing against you and you guys are already beating Rags all right let's see what happens it is hard honestly I even when I know the answers some people are somehow very fast all right next question I mean I mean now in in my family now we are all playing worldle and and I'm last why should you prepare statements full disclosure we have no oh prepared statements are required to speed up queries to ensure they are ready for the send stage to properly cook them for guests I was like to prepare my statements for guests yeah time for the question yeah no just saying that we are building a w on top of Astral right now for another I know I haven't looked at it I seen you guys were doing it all right wonderful yes the majority you got that right to speed up queries that is the the key thing and by the way I'm going to make the argument that unless you have a really good case you should always be preparing your statements like what Cedric said earlier if you truly have a dynamic query or if you know the query is ever going to truly ever run once you should absolutely prepare them one thing we didn't really mention earlier is that when you when you don't prepare statements when you just use a simple statement or whatever every time that query is run it has to pars and compile it and do that when you prepare it it's done once and then it's cached up on the server right um it can significantly reduce the amount of network um overhead and such you have especially in the case of Cassandra if you're executing thousands and thousands of queries a second asynchronously right you really want to prepare them um so anyway the key thing there is to speed up queries and and I got my first error you didn't vote in time you know so I'm not doing well all right let's see what the leaderboard looks like and see how how well all of you are destroying Rags um let's see what's going on here what's going on here all right so mark again with the fastest time John number two so Mark John and Le are just holding those top three spots there rag is nowhere to see be seen at all I didn't all right going to the next question question three or four get yourselves ready prepare but it's still anybody's game right anybody's game how do you properly Define a Cassandra data model oh going back a little bit with the conceptual data model in application workflow with the logical data model with the physical data model with copy paste from stack Overflow so true I do love that so true let's rock out rocking out feel like I should be working out right now all right and oh yay the vast majority got you that got that right yes you start with the conceptual data model and your application workflow um both The Logical data model and physical data models are derived from using your conceptual dat Mod on your application workflow first right so a little bit of review on that one oh go ahead yeah give yourself a pat on the back if you did not attend the previous two weeks and still managed to get this right yeah exactly agreed agreed all right let's see what our leaderboard looks like did we make this too easy for Mark John and Le I think oh I see Dragonite is working up though Dragonite you're close there you're close oh oh and Le takes the second spot pushes J up but still in the top three Mark is holding on into that lead and Rags yet again is nowhere to be Sav I don't even know what to you know how how is Mark answering so fast that's what I want to know how are you doing it Mark how are you doing it all right let's see question four this one is for all the marbles let's see what happens here at the very end what is object mapping used for helps to write cql code eases Dev with Associated table uh map mapping to objects connects objects to each other for finding objects on a map I do like that one I mean I want to find objects on a map all right a little bit more of a spread but the most most most of you got this right yes to ease the development associated with associating uh tables uh to objects and um it doesn't really help you write cql code cuz a lot of times doing it in a more fluent style and stuff anyway you're kind of breaking up the cql and um uh it doesn't really it's not responsible for connecting the object right that's where the session comes into play in such yeah and honestly a lot of a lot of the examples don't use the object mapping um you know although I'm sure next week you're going to be using it a little bit more exactly oh a little bit prepare yourself Cedric is going to make you use the maer that's what he's going to do all right let's see what here's the leader board uh oh I think John got knocked out J and Dragonite got knocked out oh oh look at how it changed at the end so Mark is our winner flying shoe comes out of the bottom list and Le takes number three so congratulations to our three top so if you're one of our top three winners mark flying Sho take a screenshot of your app right now because you're going to send that on to Gary Harvey at data.com we're going to show that to you in a moment but I want to give you a moment to take a screenshot to get that so you can get credit and get your swag and I know it's a little bit too late for silin who said am I mistaking our mobile is lagged versus desktop yes unfortunately um oh uh actually it's the other way around the desktop is lagged versus mobile um just just for the future if you're if you're playing along I think it's easier to look at your phone and do it at least for me anyway yeah true true all right hopefully you all have your screenshots and with that I'm going to put up a quick survey for you to give us some information and then we will move on all right so if you are one of the top three winners if you were first second or third place please send an email to gary. Harvey data.com and include a screenshot of your menty screen of your win right and you will be sent a voucher to get your swag and congratulations thank you all right so next week we we we've said it a couple times next week is going to be the final week of our boot camp series uh where we're going to focus on apis uh and microservices with Bic and Sandra so taking the knowledge you've gained today and everything and then pushing that out to go to the next step with uh apis and such and again if you haven't done it already join us on Discord because we can help you out a lot more there especially if you have homework questions or whatever again once we end the session today then the YouTube chat will stop um so by the way if you do in the YouTube chat I'll just go ahead and just do it if you did do it bang Discord nightbot should give you the Discord link and you can join that way and as always subscribe to the YouTube channel if you want why would you subscribe right um for one if you like this workshop and the kinds of materials that we have um then when you subscribe you'll automatically get notified of our upcoming workshops and not only that we have a ton of other content we have influencers that are outside of data Sachs that have been doing things with Cassandra and Astra um we have other types of content that we put out there um there are self-service workshops there's all sorts of topics everything that are covered more than what we're just doing doing the boot camp so it's worth taking a look at the YouTube channel and with that uh thank you Rags Cedric anything you guys want to leave uh folks with uh no it was great we will play the very same session in 13 hours so you know if it's late for you and you know you want to catch me uh next tomorrow morning let's I would be ready to replay that content in 13 hour yeah you know first I know Mark uh was was a little bit frustrated there Mark Smith uh you know if you have the time the patience the inclination whatever to attend in 13 hours um you know feel free to do so otherwise uh you know come to Discord I think one of our objectives David uh sedric and myself was to finish on time and more or less you know um 9 minutes is okay we're on Bank time right it's Bank time yeah exactly doing good but really want to appreciate you know the time that everybody has taken and to kind of absolutely deal with some of the waggies of a new um Workshop right yeah great yeah absolutely well thank you everybody and take care we will see you again in the future and have a good day and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that Bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of Cassandra you grew those Powers until she can multiply at will moved with Limitless speed and unmasked hidden knowledge with those Powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous feats",
