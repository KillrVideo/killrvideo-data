    "text": "Cassandra is being developed by a group of Engineers around the world now in Apache projects the people who can make changes to the code are invited in and they're called committers so we gathered a bunch of committers and asked them what are they excited about now these are the perfect people to ask right these are people who are trying to solve problems every single day they're working their jobs and using Cassandra and developing Cassandra so it would be kind of fun to find out what they think about Cassandra five so how about it what are you excited about in Cassandra 5 thank you hi I'm John Haddad Apache Cassandra committer since 2017. you may be asking yourself what am I excited about for Cassandra 5. well as someone who spent the last two decades focused on efficiency I am very excited for support for Java 17 and it's low latency garbage collectors like zgc now the goal of these collectors is sub millisecond pause times and more of a set and forget it model than Alternatives like par new and CMS which generally required uh some Advanced degrees in both physics chemistry and math in order to understand how to tune correctly uh and the project unfortunately defaulted to them for a long time and now as a consultant for Apache Cassandra I spent a lot of times helping teams tune GC and for a lot of folks this can be pretty overwhelming in fact most of the time people just want to rely on the project to provide same defaults for them they just want to take whatever the project has and put that in production now as the project matures and memory management improves we'll see improvements in both the duration and frequency of GC pauses that means we'll see less frequent GC pauses and when they happen they'll take less time this will make it easier to run denser nodes meaning your cluster will be less expensive to run I love the idea of saving money just by doing an upgrade and who wouldn't be excited about that what are you excited about thank you I'm Andreas since 2016. what I'm excited about for Cassandra 5 is dynamic data masking it is a security anonymization feature that is available in many databases out there and that is long overdue in Cassandra it allows to obscure sensitive information while still allowing access to the masked columns it replaces the real values of the columns by obscure generic data for example it can replace numeric values by just zeros or it can redact the values of a text column so the user only sees some characters replace it by asterisks Dynamic data masking doesn't change what is stored on disk instead the masking is done dynamically at query time for this is consists on a series of regular SQL functions that transform the cell values these are generic functions that can be used in regular queries so users can decide to use the masking functions to produce a secure cool results additionally administrators can attach any of these masking functions to The Columns of the table schema that way the unprivileged users will always see the masked data even if they don't specify the functions in the query the set of available masking functions is relatively small at the moment but there are plans to include more functions in the future anyway users can use their own UDF functions for masking so it should be pretty easy to add custom types of masking and what are you excited about thank you uh I'm vinaycella Apache Cassandra committee since 2019 and I've been associated with Apache Cassandra and its Community for more than a decade uh what am I excited about Cassandra Fayo well Cassandra Fayo introduces lots of new features aimed at providing and uh you know more guardrails for developers to prevent common mistakes and improving the overall stability and performance of the database so with the introduction of guardrails framework in Cassandra 41 we were able to implement soft and hard limits on user actions this allows us to restrict actions like such as you know the number of columns per table and preventing the use of allo filtering on queries in Cassandra version 5.0 though we have added several new guardrails to enhance the operated experience increasing the reliability and availability of Cassandra and also focusing on user experience from the living experience of operating and running like hundreds of production critical clusters believe me when I say I'm so thankful for these new guardrails I really mean it and that makes operated life way easy for example restricting the drop key space commands and implementing the limits on your you know column value sizes it basically codifies all of your best practices and helps operators and users avoiding lots of these aha moments and oops moments and avoid you know making these catastrophic uh mistakes in your production critical clusters these guardrails you know certainly help prevent lots of these oops moments and dropping production critical uh you know important key spaces and losing data due to any of your user or operators thank you what are you excited about thank you a mix mweaver Apache Cassandra committer since 2016. what I'm most excited about in Cassandra 5 is the way that we are and continuing to find Our Fate with real open source with our diversity and our engineering hygiene by real open source what I mean is we're not just open source that's controlled by one company we're not open source that's thrown over the wall or open source that's used just for marketing we have multiple vendors multiple companies and multiple employees behind our contributors this goes to the heart of many ASF principles as well with longevity and sustainability of our Tech when you look at how it looks after our user base it brings to the technology more different points of view a richer set of features and applications that are out there that we want to address this helps us modernize the technology which goes to the heart of what open source actually is it also encourages diversity especially amongst our development community we are a community of Builders around the world and we get to transcend many of our day-to-day boundaries but the more diverse we can create that family the more fun we can have and that's really important for all of us the last point is engineering hygiene as more and more of us and more diverse group of us come together we have to continue to approach our engineering practice with not just Prestige which Cassandra has long been known for but also a degree of hygiene this comes from building our QA and our CI to build better trust amongst us but it also is what's enabling some of the radical features which are coming in 5-0 stuff like a chord we can't get over the Finish Line if we're not all working together as a team these are the things that I'm really excited about that's me what are you excited about thank you I'm Jordan West Patrick Cassandra committer since 2020 and what am I excited about in Cassandra 5 honestly as an on-call engineer it's just really more sleep the Cassandra Community has really invested a lot this year and showing that Cassandra 5 is even more bulletproof and reliable than ever before and as an operator of hundreds of clusters and thousands of nodes this matters immensely to me my team and my nighttime comfort one of the things I'm most excited about is the new transactional metadata feature uh the Cassandra subsystem that handles membership today is one of the causes of some of the worst incidents we deal with whether it be data loss or really oddly configured Cassandra clusters uh these are the ones that you know really take a lot of time to unwind and deal with and having this new system that takes a more consistent approach to membership instead of the previously eventually consistent approach I think is the key to making Cassandra stronger when it comes to Cluster membership I'm also really excited about the new mem tables means we can take more rights faster this is really important when you got an ml job running overnight it's just hammering the cluster and the odds of it waking me up now is lower and lower than ever before and when we do have incidents we're gonna have more insight into Cassandra than ever the new virtual tables new Diagnostics more metrics it's going to let us solve incidents faster so I know with Cassandra 5 when I go to bed I'm less likely to get woken up and when I do I'm going to solve our problems faster and get back to bed faster and what are you excited about thank you my name is Jacob tagina and I'm a committer on the Apache Cassandra project since 2020 so what am I excited about Sandra 50 well in the future versions of Cassandra the community will be offering developers the opportunity to be more efficient without sacrificing performance or scalability this may seem like a joke but it's true with the implementation of their core distributed transaction protocol developers can free up time for other tasks while the system continues to function seamlessly on commodity Hardware the Accord protocol solves two issues that previous consensus protocols could not address achieving globally available consensus and doing so in a single round trip with the Accord protocol developers can now Implement acid transactions at scale without having the code complicated workarounds one example where the global consensus is required is Bank transfers where money is abstracted from one account and add it to another should and the dish should be done precisely in that door the observing process needs exclusivity to prevent other processes from making changes that can lead to inconsistencies or unexpected results such as allowing a transfer from an account that has gone below zero isolation guarantees that only one process can make a change at a time and if two processes are competing for the same data one of them will have to wait for the other to complete the new syntax that developers will see in the Cassandra Theory language is contained within the begin transaction and commit transaction decorations everything inside these transaction markers will happen atomically and in isolation from other processes for example let's say we want to transfer 20 dollars from Alice account to box account the Accord protocol is still work in progress but the paper is already available and developers are encouraged to join dsfs like Channel Cassandra Accord to learn more about this exciting development and connect with Developers and what are you excited about Cassandra Bible thank you uh my name is Brian lambof I'm with data stacks and I've worked on core database since 2014 I became a committer in 2015. what I'm excited about in Cassandra 5 is local storage plugability and various ways that we're making use of it now we've had a compaction strategy pluggability for for some time now we're introducing talkability of assistable formats and mental implementations and these come with two alternate solutions that people can use in Cassandra 5. one of them is the btis table format which is a sustainable format made for fast drives ssds are a couple of those magnitude better than spinning disks in finding data so they need data structures that are faster and can use take advantage of their efficiency our Solutions are actually our implementation of 3DS stable format indexes there are so fast that when they're used in memory when they're cached in memory they can be faster than custom in memory structures right the key cache uh what this lets us do is do away with the key cache Which is less management for you for the operators of the database uh one of the other things that we can do away with is the index summary because this is now part of the um of the indexing structure you don't need to manage the separate space for for the index summary the new format is practically better with green white partitions as well which is a separate Improvement and it's more compact which means more of it can fit in memory than things can be better faster because of this uh the the other Improvement that we've introducing uh is an improvement of mem cables we're introducing a new trim table implementation which is uh using a try data structure some of you may may know that about 10 years ago the adaptives Radix 3 data structure brought a bit of excitement to a database Community because there's a new data structure in breaking news on indexes we are building on top of that and we're going beyond that we're doing also things like cash friendly fixed size blocks to make it even more efficient than the Adaptive rate extreme so we end up with something that's really fast and it's also something that stored off Heap which means that the garbage collector doesn't need to look at it uh because the garbage collection doesn't need look at it there's less garbage collection that we have to do much less garbage collection that we have to do uh the new structure is also more compact which means you can fit more data in the same memory location and as a result of all these advantages one of the things you can see is sometimes we can double the right throughput of the database just by changing the mem table augmentation thank you and what are you excited about thank you hi my name is Lorena Poland and I've been an Apache Cassandra committer since 2021. what am I excited about for Cassandra 5.0 step 26 unified compaction strategy unified compraction strategy brings together our old Legacy compaction strategies like CT uh size tiered and level compaction strategies and allows you to have uh workloads that are either read or write or both read heavy or write heavy or Bose what's really great is that you don't need to know anything to migrate to UCS there's zero overhead it just works because it understands the Legacy strategies and you don't need to have any knowledge about how CTS Cs and LCS work anymore there's parallelism parallelism in how uh unified compaction strategy Works which has made it um a much faster um compaction strategy which is great and it has reduced the space overhead that you need no more setting aside 50 of your disk space to cover your compaction strategies finally the very uh most important is that it has a scaling factor that allows you to tune to what you need for your Cassandra cluster so if you need it to be right have you can tune it to that if you needed to be uh read heavy you can tune to that and if you just want something in between that works well for whatever your workload is uh unified compaction strategy is really the answer so I hope you get as excited as I have check it out and what are you excited about thank you um 2015. what I'm excited about for lesson number five is SEI storage attach index in 2016 sassy was added to the castle record base and it came with a set of innovation unfortunately we did not invest enough in sassy and we had to Market experimental in Cassandra 4 because it was not matching the standards that we wanted to set for the future of Apache Casino SCI will feel that word it it has been built on top of sassy Innovation and comes with his own set of innovation like enabling user to index multiple column without having scalability issue or is is optimized for the space usage and it also optimized somewhere here like um numeric crunch queries there is a plan also to add some new Improvement like support for all or like um Sai will enable a new set of query capability for me without the drawbacks that secondary index or sassy had and you what are you excited about thank you and what am I excited about I'm excited that it's happening we're finally going to get some features that I've been asking for for a long time and some of those features are really going to change Cassandra so it is exciting and thanks to everyone that participated that was a lot of fun and I could see that it was way outside of your comfort zone but I'm appreciating the fact that you actually participated this is a really cool idea I hope we get to do it live someday probably at Cassandra Summit and speaking of Cassandra Summit everyone you saw here today will probably be there plus many more committers there are a lot of them and they'll be at the Cassandra Summit if you want to ask them questions or talk live just talk about the project these are people who understand how it works they work on it every single day and if you're ever interested in learning how to commit code to Cassandra they're the right people to talk about and they're always available on the ASF slack thanks again everyone for participating in today's panel",
