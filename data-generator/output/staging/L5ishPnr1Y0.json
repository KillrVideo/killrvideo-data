can hear us please set the thumbs up in the youtube chat so we will know we can start today we have an exciting topic to talk about and we have a special guest from russia uh mithya stankov a data scientist who will help us to get deeper into the machine learning world hey hi miriam hi ravi hi ronald naresh amazing to see you here uh chase asks are we meeting on youtube and zoom at the same time or just youtube youtube is the primary place for us to meet and you can ask your questions in youtube chat and we will do our best to answer them hi constantine i see some familiar names already in the youtube chat that's great and looks like sound is good video is good and we can start we are going to cover a lot of amazing things today and not only we will be speaking but also you will be pushing buttons because it's a workshop and there is nothing better than learning and forced by the practical lab let's go and let's do it for follow fast step by step so first things first it's data stacks mandel learning special program with special guests delivered to you by datastax developers our goal is to talk to you about the most important topics in informational technologies software development and all the related things from engineers to engineers no marketing absolutely free and they're here to make these practical also as much as possible good there yes andrea there is a github for this course that's not exactly a course but just an introduction of workshop and i will give you the link very soon now if you will like this workshop mostly probably you will like our other workshops today we have intro to machine learning this wednesday we have rebuilding a multiplayer game with real-time interactions using event streaming and next week we are going to get closer look at spring webflux and nosql databases in our build and appointment scheduling up workshop next wednesday good so and today this is introduction to machine learning with apache cassandra and apache spark delivered to you by alex wolishnev and dmitry astankov thank you very much for watching let's start two words about myself i'm um developer advocate lead a data starts cloud architect and big fan of each and every new technology which makes this world a better place and of course machine learning in no way could have escaped my attention but you know what i'm not a professional data scientist i have a little bit different specialization so today with me dmitriya stankov could you please say a word about yourself yeah sure thank you uh hello everyone uh it's very nice to well not see you but feel your presence and um i am a data scientist at aquarium company um that's the general idea of it uh i'm probably not not a very and not working very long as a data scientist but still i'm interested in this area for what uh two and a half years now so i can probably know a thing or two about this thing yes great and miriam asks us is data starts based in germany data stocks is remote native so it's based everywhere including germany australia france um italy but our headquarters are in the united states santa clara so let's move on um a little bit of housekeeping so you will understand how this workshop works first of all streaming we have a mainstream primary stream you mostly probably watch us there right now on youtube of course and we have a plan b if something goes wrong with youtube we can switch to twitch uh twitch we are hosted as datastax developers but primary platform is youtube then uh you can ask your questions on youtube chat but you know what as long as stream is over it's all gone and you cannot communicate with us anymore and we don't like it we like to communicate and talk to you so we have a dedicated discord server data stacks developers and we can talk regarding this workshop even after then tomorrow next week next month when the workshop is over we still will be there at least me then for the materials everything is published on github and of course everything stays available to you forever as long as github exists i hope it will be quite a long time and finally for the run time for today lab practical part we will use cassandra as a data storage uh spark as a let's say machine learning platform for us for today and our parallel computations platform better to see and a little bit of python yep framework yeah better better call it framework and um python as a programming language but if you are not familiar with python don't worry it's all prepared and it's all well explained so you don't have to be a python expert it's completely fine to be a beginner as long as you understand any programming language you will be fine with our lab then let's move on to do the practical part to do the lab you have two options if you have docker and if you have docker compose you can do it using your own laptop or computer or whatever you prefer and it's a great one because you can do it today or tomorrow or after a week later wherever you have time it will be good enough but if you cannot install docker or whatever for whatever reason but you still want to do their lap that's amazing because we have you cover it we have cloud instance launch it for you and if you will decide to do a lab after the session you will contact me i will give you the contacts later on and i will create a cloud machine for you to do the exercises to run the lab don't worry we can make it so okay for local setup you will need docker and docker compose please first watch i'll doing those exercises don't rush you will have enough time to do it later on your own and for cloud setup please contact me to get your cloud training instance easiest way to do it is just to contact me using linkedin data stacks dot io alex or use my formal email address which is way much longer so i suggest you to go for linkedin then we are getting to a very important part which is a definition what is machine learning one of the formal definitions or maybe not so formal says us what machine learning is a field of study what gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed that is an incredible thing that's a very nice explanation wow computers learn without explicit programming amazing but if that really explains anything i don't think so but you know what if you go to wikipedia it won't help you neither because wikipedia is like we have a joke wikipedia is useless if you know what is it you don't know you don't need wikipedia definition and if you don't know it won't help that's exactly like that for machine learning because when you start to read you get lost very soon machine learning is a scientific study of algorithms and statistical models what computer systems use to perform blah blah blah no no no no no no we need something better i suggest ask just to use my own definition which is which doesn't explains also a lot but at least much shorter machine learning is a science of drawing circles and colorizing them why you will see in a moment um dmitry how would you uh explain machine learning before we proceed to the next steps uh i personally would go with the first explanation with which was on the first slide previous one but probably i've seen i've seen a lot of definitions and uh this is a problem actually that there isn't any um one single uh unified definition and i've heard a lot of them and probably the best ones are these this one and also the one that and the machine learning is a science um that studies algorithms um where machine learn from experience but this is probably very close to this explanation which you can see on the slide yes good so when i try to find the best explanation for for you what is a machine learning i realize that what the best explanation can be only live demo and practical love and there is no better way to explain what is it and how it works speaking of which let's take a look from another point of view not from the formal definition point of view but from how it works and when it use it and when it uses a point of view so let's take a look how it works machine learning is a scientific way to process raw data using algorithms to make better decisions so what is the raw data in this case raw data is mostly probably are some rows in your database and it can be literally everything very reports yes very often some price reports on stock exchanges yes absolutely over time any kind of data any value any change can be a raw data we can we could use later to process the pro algorithms to help us make better decisions when we get to the algorithm point of view what is an algorithm this question is a little bit harder um because uh well there are very many of them but the general idea of the algorithm will be how would you define an algorithm percent that's the process of projecting our data into our um decision or like target label whatever it is whatever we want to get yeah so if this might be not the process but but some what is it probably process yes set of steps or maybe rules set of rules let's say right right and there are many different algorithms but the general idea is always the same you give some raw data for this algorithm to process you give some um property you set up some properties of this algorithm there are different for example for k-means clustering you may need to define amount of clusters and so on so every algorithm has some tunable settings you can adjust and as a result you may get some classifications or predictions we will see it in a moment uh it's it must feel now like you are not getting the idea yet and that's perfectly fine as it's designed give us a moment yep i have just another explanation which might like um share some light on the difference between machine learning algorithms and like classical algorithms um it would be better to draw it but you can easily imagine it in your head so um compared to like classical programming where we have uh some data and we have some functions which uh do like exactly what we um like program them to do um and our our like goal is to get the output of that function and in machine learning uh what we want to achieve is uh we want to learn that function we don't know what it is so we have data and we have some labels if we're talking about supervised methods uh which we'll discuss later and we want to learn the underlying function from the data and to use it to use that function which will learn uh afterwards on new data so uh just yet again in classical programming we know the function which we apply and in machine learning we don't know them and we want to learn them yep so it's more about exploratory methods let's say but let's take a look at the thing uh what are the use cases for our algorithms in which fields of um human life they i use it first of all dmitry i believe you worked a lot with natural language processing right yes and i still do okay so what is it natural language processing what is it about uh well in general if this is about processing texts and doing a lot of things with them like for example a classical example is a machine translation and probably some well there are a lot of things that i can remember any right now well the classical example is just a machine rotation which is a like probably first thing that people tried to do with the machine learning one of the first things yeah that course relates to text from my limited point of view let's say mostly known use cases like what will be easier for our attendees guests today to recognize first will be obviously um translations second would be from my point of view um if you speak to your alexa or google assistant or siri uh your voice should be processed somehow and some actions should be taken based on that and that's also uh natural language processing because it's a process of natural language right yes but there is one uh more domain included there such as automatic speech recognition and that's somewhere at the side of natural language processing that's more to speech processing right right yeah afterwards after you after you like recognized what is being spoken then you are moving to the domain of the natural language processing right so i never thought of that from this point of view but that's perfectly right first we have to convert voice as sound waves into the text and then natural language processing should already define what's uh what the customer wants us to do okay but of course that's not the only one and only limited use case for the machine learning when we speak about the fourier costs is it's about to be prime market price or rating of something or ever that's a very common use case for machine learning algorithms aberration detection from the whatever field you can imagine fraud yes in project yes disease also perfect much very common uh field for machine learning algorithms is a classification phase recognition right voice recognition correct a categorization yes spam detection very common [Music] feature we will analyze later deeper today with naive bias algorithm but also recommendation navigation and many others machine learning is no anymore like it's not the just fantastic stories but it's just the reality uh and it's around us everywhere so um meanwhile we have a great question uh in the youtube chat i kindly suggest some machine learning articles books for beginners by the malika s uh i hope we will do something like that closer to the end of the workshop but for now let's move on we discussed a little bit of the algorithms but as said i don't really believe in the just pure theory let's take a look at it in the practice we will take a look at the k-means algorithm and we will see how it works step by step using a real live demo so there is a amazing place to play with k-means clustering i will send the link to a youtube chat but i kindly ask you first to take a look on what's going on on the screen and then later try to play with it on your own okay so k-means is a clustering algorithm it's not so much about the categorization let's say but it's more about identifying um points what relate most to each other and we will see it in a moment take a look one of the examples i like the most imagine you are going to open a pizza restaurant specialized on a delivery and you know i don't know how you have the data of all the customers in your city those have bought once or twice or many times maybe some pizza view delivery and your city is huge and you have very limited amount of money you cannot open a dozen of restaurants of course right so you want to find the best locations best place so every customer will have it's his pizza delivered hot and nice but not too old not already called and using this little lab we can try to draw some play we can try to draw some areas like for example i will take this one as an example i will add some points and show you how this algorithm works for now it's not clear what's going on but give me a second and i will explain you clustering algorithm k-means clustering algorithm is i think what tries to categorize or to put into groups to bring in the clusters some points of data you have and in this case i have a map of the city with some areas where my customers living so i can try to build my restaurant as close to them as possible and in the beginning i will use example with two clusters we will talk about that in a moment in the beginning we have raw data with raw data are those points spread over the city map and we have some centrals some central points of those clusters and there is a fun fact about k-means clustering calgary in the beginning those central points allocated absolutely randomly they can be located like that but they also can be located like that or move it absolutely differently it's not important in the beginning then i start to execute these algorithm but step by step very slowly now take a look what will happen i make the first step or first iteration that's better to call them iterations because every iteration is the same logically as the previous one first one from the previous position every central point calculates the distances to the points which it wants to cluster and it sees what in this direction we have zero points but in those directions we have a lot of them right so calculating those distances this uh point will our algorithm will try to move this point as closer to the points as possible and um simplifying like making these distances smaller and it sees what the vector we have like it all goes here but nothing goes here there is nothing there is a city border of course so we do with a step you see central the blue one and red one jump to the middle because of a vector of this uh the vector which will decrease those distances well obviously leading customer center can we say what those points are clustered well enough uh not really but we did just first enter iteration then we're proceeding with that when we proceed with that and we do next iteration how it will work exactly like the previous uh a k-means clustering algorithm will calculate for each point for this central is it getting uh heavier in this direction or this direction or this direction which point is closer to us which point is more far away and the same for the blue one and we will do the next step boom and just after the two steps by measuring those distances and choosing the vector which will decrease the medium distance for us we are already getting somewhere and we still have a huge difference you see we can compare for this blue point we have those points very very close their distance will be minimal but those points are very far away difference between these distances and these distances is very different and we see what delta position is over 150 i won't explain it for now i want to keep it simple but the point is we see what those points not really belong to this cluster they are too far away in comparison with those but if you take this point they may be better fit because we already have covering their neighbors and this distance may be smaller so we make one more step and now it's included here we have a very nice blue cluster and red cluster well it's better than it was before for sure but there is a problem first let me finish it we still have some delta position something not as big as it was before but quite high so i will do one more iteration boom and we now see what blue cluster starts to conquer red points here and it tries to find the points it's closer by but this one moves to the uh bottom right we make again iteration again again again again again and now it's over after 11 iterations delta position at zero that is the perfect place for us to find e and here comes the one of the biggest limitations and biggest problems of these algorithm you must understand k means clustering demon what does k means in this case ki means clusters and the problem of this algorithm or maybe feature i'm not sure if we should call it problem exact name is what you have to define how many clusters do you need and why this example looks not so nice like here we have a very nice sweet cluster very good but this one looks not so nice why because we brought in the beginning two clusters but take a look what happened if i raise this number and restart the conditions so i will restart it and i will oops i will pull them again to the side so you will see all the steps in a better way they won't probably be the same now yeah that's exactly the same extra points yeah i occasionally pulled some extra points but i believe still center of paths will be somewhere here so now we have three clusters general picture must be the same yeah and we go for the first step and it was exactly the same we are calculating centers and on the second step we see already this purple one is engaged but take a look at this one it has a huge center of mass here also huge center of mass here but those are much closer so distances here in general shorter distances here in general longer what does that mean for us it will try to move closer to this point if i do next step boom indeed blue one jumps to a center of mass for this cluster and after a couple of more iterations they successfully divided those points into three groups and what just happened we just colorized it some random circles uh that was about the previous definition what machine learning is about colorizing circles and that was a live example of k-means clustering algorithm works by just measuring distances to each and every point and trying to find out the way the smallest movement which will lead to making those distances smaller and smaller so first problem or feature of k-means clustering we already mentioned it it very depends on the amount of clusters being put on the screen and if i do too many of them i also will have some varied results and there are some more potential limitations or issues what would you mention please uh if you're asking me then as i already said the first big problem is that we must have some insights about the number of clusters beforehand before we start and the second big problem is that we must um the depending on the data um and the number of clusters that we take the initial position of clusters still matters i remember you use you said that it doesn't matter but it matters and as far as i know there are no methods to conquer this like two nowadays so right so the initial position of these clusters may lead to these clusters falling into some local minimum and like never um converging to some uh global minimum which we would like to to get to yeah thank you so much so sometimes we would want to run multiple simulations to get what we want perfect and that's exactly the point why i invited you so the point is yeah allocation of central central points in the beginning is random but that matters from the point of view what if you execute this um algorithm multiple times with multiple different starting points you may get different results in the end and one more point i want to mention is yeah i like to see if i'm traveling uh there is a great question by miriam uh what do we exactly want to reach what our restaurant covers mark's locations why do we have the two points so in general first thank you for asking questions miranda that's amazing second our original idea is to find clusters or to find groups of some entities with similar properties in this case those are geographical points on the geographical map but it's not about that's not only about the maps let's say that's that can be about very many different uh situations and cases in this particular example we want to have um we want to cover uh the map of our customers to help to keep delivery time as short as possible for each of them and meanwhile not overpay for very redundant restaurants so i can create here eight clusters and run more and more and more and more moves and we will see it will work like that but it's not the perfect uh distribution it's just redundant and i started with two clusters just for the example to explain uh how they will move and i will be how we will divide those points between those two clusters and that's obvious what two restaurants uh actually will be in this case bad for all of them from the minimal distance point of view right so our cluster count is uh wrong in this case and only by adding more clusters we may find better distribution or like for in our use case in our example is the best one good so what was algorithm one of many which takes distances measures them and tries to move the central point into the direction what will minify shrink those distances as much as possible i suggest you to play later with this clustering demand but so far we have to proceed with others it's not the only algorithm we have to cover today few more points before we start with a lab there are some there are some important things we have to remember first separation of supervised to unsupervised data or supervised or not supervised unsupervised algorithms methods you have the methods thank you vera yeah algorithm in this case is not the right word actually there is a little bit more of the classifications maybe later you could mention something about reinforced learning but first let's explain things about the supervised things and unsupervised things i will take first step with supervised methods take a look supervised machine learning is first of all all about data is labeled or must be labeled or better to say classified for example let's take a look data is labeled or must be labeled what does that mean let's take a look and emails do you get a lot of spam i don't know about you i use it to have a lot of spam but not anymore what happened machine learning happened thanks to the advanced ways of machine learnings use it for supervised methods for exactly for email classification if this email is a spam or not that's called supervisor fashion learning methods and it's used when we have to label or classify emails out of a huge amount of um data then if this particular bank operation is a proud or not like you use it to make all your [Music] but you use it to use your to make all your boom use it to buy your things all the time in calgary canada and now quite surprisingly you are trying to execute an operation somewhere in completely different place although your last operation was just five minutes ago in calgary now it's somewhere in another country in another continent is this operation of road or not is there are some more cases uh but anyway it's always about their classification uh or well not exactly about the classification but these data is labeled or our and that's very important for us what is it about um another explanation yes another explanation will be uh that we have in supervised methods uh we have data and we have the right answers for the data as our target because in unsupervised methods we won't have the right answers yeah a good side of them supervised methods they are easy to test you will see it very soon uh as we um have some uh data like in order for our uh spam uh labeling algorithm to be to work we first have to mark some previous emails as spam or not spam and i believe you did it already many times sending some emails to spam that's a spam that spam that's a spam we weren't just cleaning our email boxes but we were also helping uh mail service providers let's say to uh train their models to identify to identify spam from not spam so we did all this great sharing work to help each other to get rid of the spam now about easy to test as data is labeled uh we can that's easier for us to estimate if our model uh data measure the machine learning model we train it works good or not good we will explain it in the next slide then uh what would you say about unsupervised learning well the data is not labeled here okay that's quite obvious but well that's the general idea behind this group of methods and this is a quite like a special group uh where um all well all the methods are based on this uh assumption that we don't know the labels and what we want to do with the data is we either want to reduce the dimensionality or we want to find some anomalies or we want to like group the elements based on some underlying pattern which we want which we don't know ourselves but we want our model to find out and that's what we've seen in k-means clustering and um well that's like the general idea behind this group of methods yep by the way meanwhile we have a great question on youtube chat so what's the difference between k-means and nearest neighbor algorithm frankly speaking i never use it never a nearest neighbor algorithm so i cannot transfer live uh maybe dmitry can but if we can't we can meet later on discord and discuss that that's for sure yeah let's leave it to the at least to the end of this session yep good so let's move on then uh then how does that work uh on the higher level let's say we will see it step by step on this learning workflow which takes as an example any supervised algorithm because for any supervised algorithm it will work like that preparation data split training and prediction let's take a closer look first thing we have to do is to convert raw data into data with features and labels what exactly that means imagine you have 1 000 of different emails those emails by default just a raw data because no one knows is it a spam or not and so on and so forth so first thing we do is we go and manually mark up those emails with labels this is a spam that's not spam that spam spam spam spam spam not spam spam spam spam spam at least that's how it was before right uh then that will be the data already with some features or labels prepared data for uh to train our model then we split these data into three parts bigger part which is a training set we will use it to train our model validating set and testing set validating set we will use to uh configure or yeah configure change settings for our model if it will be required like we did with clusters for k-means and testing set we will use to estimate our model is if it's good or not then first thing we do is the training of the model based on this training set data what is a model in this case that's the model we create or machine learning creates based on the algorithm we decided to choose and it's being trained on the uh raw data oh sorry preparing data we will do it just like 15 minutes on the real data then we use separated validating set to tune this model to show uh to see like maybe everything is good but we may need to change some settings for this algorithm amount of clusters uh some more things and then finally when we think what model is is done we can estimate it with the testing set and decide if this model is good or not based on some metrics we will discuss in a couple of moments and in the end we export the strain model as a final model and then we can start to use it to process new data like new incoming emails you never seen them before and predict labels for the new emails you just receive it to say this one is spam this one is not spam maybe that's the general idea now before we proceed to the lab we have to talk about metrics because you cannot control what you can't measure let's take a look what are the metrics for us we will explain metrics base it on medicine medical example or tumor example imagine a situation we work at the hospital or with a hospital and we want to help them identify malignant tumors to benin tumors let's take a look we have 100 people under our supervision nine of them have a millennium tumor which is very very very bad that's deadly basically and 91 of them have been in tumor which is well also not great but not as deadly not as bad as malignant tumor the goal of our model is to identify those who are safe with a millennium tumor who has malignant tumor from those who have not uh malignant but benign tumor which is not so bad so we can arrange proper uh treatment right and we have a model which gives um some predictions let's take a look first about uh poor fields we have here true positive false positive false negative true negative admitting could you please maybe explain us what's the true positive false positive and so on for someone not into that that sounds a little bit weird what is a false positive uh yeah so this table basically is called confusion matrix and it represents so it is divided as we have um our model predictions on like columns and we have um true labels on on the rows that's like a generally is drawn and a true positive uh means that uh our model predicted positive a positive class and it um it is a true so it is truly positive and uh also what we mean by positive well uh very often uh a classification task is um being conducted on the uh in the situations where uh we want to like find a detect or classify some um rare class among a huge amount of um neutral class let's say so uh the neutral class is um called a negative class which we are not interested in and the positive class is otherwise uh the class which we are interested in and it's called positive and so this table represents um the number of samples which fall into different categories so as i already said the true positive means that as model predict positive and it is really positive the false positive means that the model predict the class being positive but it's not in reality and so on so i i think you should get the idea of these um definitions and to be honest a lot of uh skilled professionals even through three years of their experience they still misunderstand them but that's probably normal because you don't often uh work with them yeah okay good so when true positive and true negative regress it right our model gets it right and false positive false negative our model gets wrong now we are talking about matrix uh so we are talking yeah there is a mention from ronald gaskin sounds like we are getting into binary a little and yes indeed because that's um very simple classification situation it's indeed very binary we have 100 people all of them are sick and some of them are very bad sick and some of them are just not so very bad sick so yeah it's a complete binary situation you're right ronald so why are we talking about this table right now because we want to understand how do we estimate our model if it's good or not if we should throw it to um garbage or we can deploy to production and change lives of our customers with it now yeah but for real it may be sounds a little bit too much but it is for real first metric you usually meet talking about the any kind of model is the accuracy accuracy is a very simple evaluating matrix it's a very basically simple idea amount of predictions model identified correctly very simple accuracy is the amount of correct predictions divided by total predictions in this case total predictions 100 because we have 100 people correct predictions so all true positives one and all two negatives 19 is 91. in this example we have accuracy 91 divided by 100 0.91 uh understand what we cannot have accuracy higher than one actually usually one is unreachable hey so 0.91 looks very good and that's very suspicious if you get an accuracy of uh one hundred percent or one right i i would check everything uh like that double check everything if i would get a 100 accuracy accuracy right right right so now um base it on this accuracy and your own personal experience would you please write in the youtube chat if you think this model we created is good or bad what do you think accuracy is quite high you can see it do you think this model is good or not so good just write it into the youtube chat yes good no bad i'm not sure i see we have few dozens of people on youtube and that's amazing so please just throw your opinion don't don't think too deep we have to move on but i want to see that overall opinion on that if this model is good or wrong good or bad or not so good not so bad just medium 50 50. ronald thinks it's good um any more opinions uh-huh sara ambedkar thinks it's just good good okay okay free opinions is enough already but i will be happy if you will add some more but at this moment let's step back of our can be better okay okay good good can be better that's nice now let's take a look sometimes it's important to stop step away and think about what you are doing and why you are doing that is amazing josh turner just got my point and vincenzo is also very close to that oh yeah actually not very close but exactly to a point sorry not good for the purpose there are many scenarios then this model will be good indeed but don't forget we are speaking about humans we are speaking about people take a look the amount of false negatives eight out of nine people who have very very bad sickness potentially they are terminally ill we are sending home eight of them without proper treatment so out of nine very very very sick people we just left eight of them with no proper treatment and that's quite a bad result so the answer is this model is not just not really great the right answer is from the treatment from health treatment or sickness treatment point of view we could have better results by literally throwing a coin if we throw a coin it will give us again yes or no results true or false but normally you have like 50 persons uh distribution on quite big numbers right so out of those nine people four to five will be identified as really see with a very dangerous sickness so having this millennium tumor as a result by literally throwing a coin we would get better result than this model and yeah uh catherine we are getting there that is very good very very very good point catherine we are getting into the uh recall or we are getting to the next slide let's let's call it this way as you can see accuracy is a great metric but in some scenarios it's not as useful yes we do and i wanted to point that in general what is bad about accuracy is that it doesn't take into account the importance of classes that we have so like in this case we are talking about the situation where our our positive class is more important to us that we want to catch all positive classes and we um don't really care if we put that truly negative class to the positive class um but we do care about the opposite situation and accuracy just it doesn't care it just measures the amount of correct predictions so if you just uh want to catch like a single sample uh out of um a large number of uh total samples and uh like we we would uh have an accuracy of like 99 0.99 and um that's what accuracy would show but if we were to catch that single sample and we wouldn't that then we failed but accuracy won't show us that to us right so um then we get to next metrics we can use to estimate our models in this case precision and recall those a little bit different maybe you would like to tell us something about the precision well the precision is the number of truly classified positive examples divided by the number of the examples which model predicted as positives and it's better for you to just think think over and like let that definition um like get into the depths of your mind so so just yet again it's the amount of the amount of samples uh classified correctly as true as positive examples divided by the number of uh the positive examples of which model thoughts were positive in this example situation is very simple uh precision is amount of true positives divided by predicted positives that means we have one true positive we successfully identified one of them and overall amount of predicted positives was two so one false positive one true positive so we have one one and one of them was correct one divided by two equals zero point five on the scale from zero to one we already see what precision for this model is 0.5 that's definitely not good [Music] okay then what is the recall recall also known as sensitivity recall counts correctly identified positives out of all real positives so we calculate here uh true positives which was one you remember two all real positives which was nine as you remember and as a result we have for this tumor example recall is one divided by nine zero point eleven so despite the high accuracy precision is bad and recall is awful that's why you never should measure your well in most of the cases you should not measure your model based on one single metric because other metrics may be not so optimistic that's why people introduced or data scientists introduced some how to call it in english a composite metrics may you say a little bit about that do you think well first i wanted to point out that you can use single magic but what you should do that you should uh choose it carefully all right and um if we're talking about the metric that combines precision jackal that's called the f score and this is generally a harmonic mean of some values it it it can be applied not only to precision you call it's a like a general um a general thing but um if you're talking about like machine learning and precision and recall that's uh equal to um doubled product of precision and recall divided by the sum of this matrix precision integral if if we are talking that this precision and recall metrics are equally important to us because there is a way of also weighting them in different proportions if one is more important to us than another right okay so and one last point uh before we go on is the understanding of underfitted versus overfitted models take a look i mentioned before uh what for them our model we split some data and we split the row whether we split the prepared data we have into groups two or three depending on if we do tuning for for our model and that is a very important point on what exactly is testing or estimating our model the point is that there is a if we proceed to talk about emails and classifying spam not to spam then this testing set is a range of set of emails what was labeled by human mostly probably um well yeah was labeled by a human but never get to our model during the training process why is it so important take a look if any of these emails get into the model then it has a chance to train itself to be better fit and as a result when we estimate model using the same set of data as we use it to train or via partially mix it like it may lead to very bad results our estimation will be very good because testing data got into the training set but there's estimation will have nothing to do with the real life so it's very important to keep training set isolated from testing set testing set never get to model before we want to estimate this thing now why i'm talking about that right now um that's to explain under fitted to overfitted models underfitted model model which didn't get enough data during the training like that will be a common case when you try to train your model based on two small amounts of data it will maybe catch the general idea and it will try to draw you a line somehow but the real life values will not look like this line right underfitted model give you two general results it's not accurate it's just too simple it's not much the situation you want to describe to that then we have good feet or robust enough model or well generalized model it means what if they have values distributed like that and we are trying to draw a line it will also go with them remember what uh idea of that is not too much literally every point of our function but to keep as close to it as possible to all of them as possible to be able to predict next one and then find yeah yeah i mean if we were if we were able to like find the exact function that would describe all these points then we would go with just classic programming and uh write a function and just process our data but for machine learning we work with approximating data so we never get the like exact um underlying function yeah for perfect explanation and then finally we get to overfitted model or over trained model which will behave perfectly on uh playing data but as it not general enough it will try to guess and try to catch each and every point and as a result we will have some very varied behavior which won't match into the real data okay now that that's it speech is silver practices golden or talk is cheap show me the code let's take a look at the code and see how it works in a real life situation for your words about tools we are going we are going to use today uh first take a look when you work with small amounts of data you can use your own laptop and be happy the problem is as we discussed it above if you use small amounts of data your model doesn't have chances to be generalized enough it will be underfitted and if you want to train your model on the big amount of data then your laptop will be very disappointed and you will be disappointed even more because it's going to be just too slow and here comes apache spark what is uh the apache spark it's an open source general purpose uh cluster computing framework and it's distributed what does that mean if we are trying to explain complex things in a simple way it allows you to run computations over multiple servers at once same set of computations like uh making it very simple it takes all of the computations you have to execute split them into groups give them to different workers collect the results bring them together and give back to you if you want to compute simple formal simple algorithms on a small amount of data you obviously don't need it but if you have data of the big companies side size and imagine the amount of customers of apple amount of customers of netflix spotify and so on obviously there is no server in the world able to make uh able to train models that reach these sites of data then tools like spark come into the game splitting those computations uh and executing them on multiple worker nodes for our case we will use a patch spark machine learning feature which allows it to work with machine learning algorithms of course next tool we are going to discuss is apache cassandra it's as you could guess by the name also delivered to you by apache software foundation and it's an amazing database uh which is also free open source distributed also decentralize it nosql database design it to handle any amounts of data for example apple uses cassandra to store the literally hundreds petabytes of data not gigabytes no terabytes but petabytes uh there but meanwhile keep this data in the fast access it's not a cold storage but it's an extremely quick database it splits data into different partitions into multiple partitions and spread them over multiple servers also doing [Music] also using clusters of course as apache spark does but it does not for computations but to store your data that there is a very important point if you want your model to be good enough you need to use a lot of data and sometimes a lot of data just does not fit single server by the volume in this case we go with cassandra because cassandra splits it into partitions and store on multiple different servers and if amount of your data grows you can simply add more servers into your cassandra cluster and it will redistribute those partitions to a new service automatically one last feature of cassandra i like also a lot is what one cluster single cluster can consist of multiple data centers storing your data in europe asia in the united states simultaneously all servers as a part of a single cluster and of course everything is replicated multiple times each uh data piece of data stored multiple times so even if you completely lost for example uh united states data center i don't know why but if you watch hollywood movies there are always some aliens shark attacks and whatever so let's say we have lost united states data center you will still have your data untouched in europe and in asia so your application can survive of complete data center loss as you could guess it's a good feed for big distributed data sets then uh jupiter jupiter in our case a departure notebook is an open source web application which allows to create and share documents what contain live code equations visualizations and so on it used it mostly for data cleaning and transformation some simulations statistical modeling and for us first of all for educational purposes you will you will use this departure soon and you will see how it works uh last point in my list last point in my list is a data start studio it's a developer tool to work with apache cassandra vu to work with cassandra we use cassandra query language which is designed to be very similar to sql and data stack studio supports uh sql and we can work with data storage in cassandra using data stack studio then few more things uh dmitry would you please yes uh we will also use some classical tools which are um common in the area of machine learning in data science this is of course python language which is an interpreted language very simple to understand very easy easy to read and has a lot of support from built-in libraries as well as a lot of third-party libraries which extends its capabilities like probably none other language can provide uh we'll also use some tools um developed well maybe not for exactly for machine learning but which come which come in handy when you when it comes to machine learning so one of them is pandas pandas is a library um providing a lot of methods to work with tabular data um which is the basis of like classic machine learning where you work with tabular data another tool is by spark pi spark is a tool which allows you to work in python while still using the spark all the advantages of the spark framework because um the spark initially is written in um not in python i believe i i've used scala with spark uh but i don't know which main language is the basis of patch park frankly speaking i don't remember i believe it's java it should be java yes probably because as yeah yeah so but at least not python and pi spark allows you to write a writing python and use all spark um advantages another common package is numpy uh numpy is um a package for like uh numerical and computations and it's very fast uh it uses a lot of c code um under the hood and python python does so as well but maybe um i know i'm not sure maybe not as much as numpy does but um yeah it's very fast and it's it allows to do computations on uh areas of data and last but not least is the scikit-learn package uh it contains tools to work with um statistics and machine learning methods uh so it allows for analysis of data and uh yeah it's very common package in machine learning classical machine learning right good thank you so much now about the environment we will use doesn't matter if you use your uh local um docker uh deployment uh or if you use our cloud instance the idea will be the same but you know what please do not use this link because the workshop content has moved i will give you a new link my badge i didn't update it of course data stocks academy academy we need to be machine learning workshop online right this one oops um and there is a dugo ibar asks um if there will be another session for this one uh take a look this one will be or is being recorded right now so you can watch the recording and do your homework do your lab afterwards so don't worry and you can ask us questions at discord so don't worry you are not too late so here is the link to the lab now let's go what will be here as a general source of storage and computations we will use data stocks enterprise which unites uh spark and cassandra it's it includes cassandra with some advanced data stacks tweaks and um analytics engine delivered mostly by spark data stack studio we won't use to actively today but what we will use is jupyter notebook to work through all the operations all the procedures we have to do to train our model and yeah discussed over them good first lab we will do uh uses naive bias it's a supervised classification algorithm as we discussed it in the beginning wiki is not really useful when you try to read something about those algorithms yeah you're trying to understand something and you're still getting more and more uh puzzled by these definitions yeah you know when trying to find answers on wiki i usually find more questions than answers yes exactly right as a result trying to find a simple explanation of how naive bias algorithm works i will find out myself six years later with phb phd in something only then maybe i will get the idea of what's going on so don't try to read that we will find uh some better explanation uh but what you need to know is knife bias is a popular method for text categorization uh the problem of judging documents as belonging to one category or another for example a spam let's take a look better on how it works step by step as we did with k-means and you will see how it works speaking of wiki sometimes funny comics will be better explanation than wiki definitions so let's take a look that's a actually very funny one when you get it statistically speaking if you pick up a seashell and do not hold it to your ear you can probably hear the ocean uh we have people from all around the world so i have to explain this point uh there is kind of a joy joy joke or believing what in the seashell you can hear the ocean in it if you put it to your ear i'm not really sure if it's like that or not uh but that's a common believing so naive bias actuates the probabilities and in this case we will speak about the probabilities of email being spam or not on the following example take a look uh those all definitions were naive bias for scientists uh we have only one scientist here at least like next to me on the screen i prefer i'm just a human i prefer simpler explanations for humans let's take a look at naive bias algorithm for humans explain it step by step what's the story here you remember we start with preparation of the data and naive bias is a supervised algorithm that means what we have to put some labels in the beginning and as a result we want to have model a well trained model what will say this email is mostly probably spam and this prem email is mostly probably not spam normally those algorithms are trained on the tremendous amount of emails millions millions billions i don't know on the huge huge huge numbers with that they work the best but today for the educational purposes we will train our naive bias with only eight emails and let's see if it will make a good result out of that or it won't let's take a look we just got eight emails to label them get cash easy so those are subjects of our emails okay get cash easy win money now greetings from that could you lend me money it was easy i miss you wow check your trip itinerary money transfer received okay in this case we will consider money transfer received as spam it may be not literally the spam but for this case for this situation we will consider it as pump when we um label those money label label disorientable this money males they're those example males as spam and nut spam and three of them getting to spam folder money transfer received get cash easy real money now and five of them get to not spam will go to normal folder greetings from that could you lend me money i uncle i'm tired of that please stop uh it was easy i miss you check your tripod in earlier okay first action is done our data is labeled very very well let's take a look on what's happening next give me a second all right so we have this very simple eight emails only database uh data set store it from database for example and we have to train a user that we train at our model using naive bias algorithm let's see how it will work for the new email we just got a new email easy money subject is easy money is it spam or not we have to answer this question how human would ask this question what is the chance it's spam if it has subject easy money or how would scientists write it down using this notation what's the probability so p what is spam given it has subject easy money notice what theirs are separated that's not a single string but two different words that's right we split subjects into multiple uh parts to prepare for that now uh first step going live very stupid step at first but later you will see how it works uh all together with all the others um helping them devout even analyzing subjects what's web probability what email is a spam based on the data that we already have without reading any subject it's going to be 3 out of 8 that's very interesting point let's move on we will get back to this point later when we analyze those uh words uh each one separately first let's take word money let's take a look money two out of three slow work money contained in two out of three spam emails first one and second one so we have free spam emails and two of them have the word money so probability of the email uh containing a word money what is spam uh a pardon sorry a probability of the email uh which is spam to content word uh to have word money is two or three when we do the same calculation four emails those are not spam let's take a look out of five not spam emails only one completely legit can uh had the word money so we take it uh probability of the email probability of the email to have word money if it's not spam on the right side we here we have a given fact and on the left side we have probability is one out of five only one email out of five head will work money we do the same analysis for the word easy uh and uh by the way yeah it should be easy good out of free spam emails got the word easy and only one out of five not now we think a very simple idea uh it's a conditional probability email can be or spam or not spam there is uh email cannot be half spam at least for our purposes now okay so we use this very important idea to understand probability of email to be spam plus probability of email to be not spam is always equal one it cannot be 1.1 it cannot be 0.9 it's always one and now we start to calculate a very interesting idea we calculate overall um probabilities we bring them together map them together so by itself we cannot decide based on each one particular probability if this email is spam or not but combining them together we already getting somewhere so take a look uh we have um yeah let's take a look at this row probability what spam email has word easy one of three we'll see probability of a spam email to have word money two out of three and overall probability of an email to be spam is three out of eight and uh second step we we do exactly the same work but calculating probability of that to be emailed to be not spam probability of a not spam email to content to have word easy one of five probability of not spam email to have word money in subject one of five probability of an email to be not spam at all five out of eight based on our data set right very limited data set now we just calculate those values very simply one of three multiplied by two of three multiplied by three or a of eight it will be one divided by twelve we calculate the same for the probability it will not be in spawn and then bring them to the same what is it in english divider divided by yeah they're divided by the same volume and as a result as you remember what probability of email being spam plus probability of no email to be not spam is always equals with one we bring that to the situation what uh based on our data set probability of email to be spun based on words easy in money it has in the subject is going to be 0.76 are closer to 76.9 persons and this decision uh mostly probably shows us what this email is spam and we just train at our model on literally eight emails so the very very very limited data set normally we work with much higher numbers uh okay lots of numbers yeah a lot of numbers lots of lots of lots of numbers it can be hard for people not familiar with the basics of statistics because this method is mainly based on the base theorem and um this is more um like this is like more general idea of statistics maybe not machine learning itself yeah so you see i don't uh believe i i don't think you should get it all from the first scratch now i want you to get the general idea and uh two points here you have to remember for this one is what the sum of probabilities and this classification is always one then no chances it to be something third because we have only two categories spam and not spam and then second point what uh our what combination of multiple not connected points why not connect it i explained on the next slide can bring you to a very interesting mathematical results what even a pretty simple model gives you very high chance of this email to be spammed and we're not even touching the content of the email just subject we don't have much time maybe you want to add something to this example or we can go on uh no uh i mean what i would want to add is explained on the next slide so ah okay then feel free to explain next slide then uh well uh i wasn't prepared for that okay i cannot discuss i'll try to uh we discussed the bias algorithm but uh there is also one word in the name of it it's naive and why is it naive well it's because um when we're discussing when we are discussing the relations between the features and the features in the examples were the word money and the word uh easy um when this is all these features we made make an assumption a very strong assumption that these features are independent of each other what this means is that we are assuming that uh these words in the sentence they um are not connected with each other and they can follow in any order and uh they can be in any place of the sentence uh as you can probably um know that this is not always true and you can see an example of that on the slide like uh um after the word happy there is a higher probability of meeting the word birthday after this than some other word uh well maybe most of the words and um this is also true for many other phrases which consist of several words but the naive bias algorithm assumes that the features which are words in this example are independent and while this is a very strong assumption it allows for very good results in a lot of applications yep the idea may look stupid as it uh i believe very well uh shown on the right side of the slide it cannot be warm or cold outside uh at the same time if you have the answer to question if it's warm outside you already can assume what it's not called for naive bias it's not so obvious um and in the real life words are chained at interval phrases phrases if i say long long ago you can proceed with me in a galaxy far far away every word or every feature in these a chain it to a previous one in a galaxy far far away uh every next word follows because we just know this quote and naive bytes will ignore these um connections connections here connections well state it will ignore those connections quite surprisingly it's not bad it's actually even good for example as we uh consider those facts or features as isolated we can easily uh separate or parallel uh spread it into multiple different tasks and run these as we discussed it for parallel computing then different tasks can be executed on different servers different machines which may can make naive bias very very fast which also we want to have it fast of course good but we still talking and it's time finally to push some buttons so when you will deploy this docker on your docker or if you will use um our cloud instance you will have something like that and i will go for a naive bias algorithm to show how it works in our case good and kernel ready so i can start okay sorry just a second cell output clear good if you never have seen uh jupiter before don't worry you will see how it works you will get it so what are we going to do we are going to do two things first we are going to answer questions can i have bias be used to classify to classify vines rating score by its attributes and meanwhile we are going to try to estimate different wines our wine yard produces because we have limited marketing budget for the next year and we have to pick the best candidates what mostly probably will be the best so our marketing campaign will succeed and we won't try to advertise worst wines but we better advertise the best wines right so to put our budget allocated properly how do we use jupiter notebook i simply push the run button in the every cell what has to be executed and first cells are very simple uh it's python and we are importing libraries we are going to use we will use smartpotlib spl team and we will use some more libraries like pandas labor library to work with cassandra library to work with firespark and so on and so forth so we will use them to work with the data and finally most importantly we will use pi spark for machine learning algorithms and classifications we will import naive bias multi-class classification evaluator we will use to estimate our model if it's good or bad and some more things we will need to prepare data uh as we are going to work with it next step we will define a function show data frame it's not really required but it will help us to get data in nicer more structured way so it will be easier to read the data we are working uh well well well and now we are ready so we can start first um as we considering a real-life world example we will work with cassandra cassandra is often used for big sets of data so first step i will create um a clark cassandra cluster connection and connect to it all good now cassandra stores data in tables and every table must belong to at least one two bundles belong to one key space so in this case i will create a key space it's a cassandra query language don't get too much into that on the place of cassandra it can be any and our database or just data loaded from uh file from csv file for example like we will work and finally i set this key space is active if you don't have previous experience with cassandra it may be not really clear what's going on for now it's not matter then finally we will create a table or vines and let's take a look what are the qualities or what are the features of the wine we will consider there are 12 different columns fixed ac dc acidity volatile acidity and so on and so forth chlorides free sulfur dioxide and so on and so forth so mostly chemical values uh alka gold containers and finally quality first columns represent data we got in chemical lab every uh vine contains some alcohol contains some chlorines and so on and so forth but last metric is very interesting it's a quality this one was um was given by some human vine experts to as they find this fine good or not so good what's the quality of the spine from the scale from one to ten and uh we are going to load one data set which will be bigger than eight kind of fine let's take a look we will load white and red and we will load uh them into cassandra so as you see cassandra query language looks very similar to sql which makes our life much easier and i will execute this cell it takes some time you can judge okay as you see asterisk it means with cell is running if you see the number it was executed already okay no mistakes means data loaded uh we can meanwhile yeah proceed there's data loaded now we want to work with spark now data is available in the database and we want to work uh when we want to use spark to work with that first thing we do is we create a spark session very simple format in this case we will use spark session builder or the app name demo well doesn't matter master will be local one because it's all launched together get or create not so important and then second thing already matters a lot while uh this cell is being executed let's take a look that's going to be my vine data frame data frame is a set of data we are going to work with and here i tell spark to read data from a database using format or capacity spark sql cassandra so reading data from cassandra thanks to data stocks uh spark cassandra connector by the way and when we specify what are we going to read we are going to read table wines and we are going to use the key space we created before for this data final command load it takes some time then finally two prints first print just table wine row count and then finally how many we have rows in this data frame wine data frame we see it's almost 6500 we can ask our uh function to show part of this data frame just to see how it look and let's see it's a very simple table id of a wine alcohol florets citric ice it and so on and so forth quality from 1 to 10 and some other chemical values first we don't we want to simplify this setup we don't want to train our model uh base it on the bed lines we want to focus on the good vines maybe it's a mistake but this way we simplify data frame make it smaller that makes the training faster we will be will have less data to consider so here we go we have we will create a new data frame wind six data frame based on the previous one full but we will filter setting quality to be higher than 5 and now we can take a look show data frame 1 6 data frame it looks exactly the same but the only point is here we have had a quality of 5 and lower and here we always have quality of 6 and higher never 5 or anything worse good so we simplified a little bit of our work here now we will combine we will collect a vector assembler for these set of features as in input columns we will use the features we have the chemical features we have alcohol flow rate citric acid density and so on and so forth but no quality because for us in this case it's not a feature but the outcome of those features right uh and they will be collected as features we uh with this assembler we transform this data frame into the training data which we will use to train the model and uh then if we create a label indexer the input column quality output column label and that will be the main thing for us to prepare these label indexer and for this data frame so let's execute that and take a look it's not yet the training we are preparing data okay now we see this data frame training data one which has label indexer already processed training data we have had based on this vector assembler and finally then we print these training data one and count we see first what we have 4 000 now candidates why because we dropped all low quality vines that's clear and now our data frame has more so we still have id alcohol flow rates and so on and so forth but now we also have features prepare it for it and we now as we discussed we need to split our data set into training and test set we want to do tuning so we don't need um split to split it into three parts we will split it into two parts and here we do those splits training data one will be randomly splitted in the proportion uh 0.8 and to 0.2 so 80 persons will go to the first split uh 20 20 persons will go to a second split and could you please remind me this value is a random seed i believe for splitting yes exactly it is needed to be able to um reconstruct zinc the experiment so in case you need to like to check what went wrong you have the ability to split your data in exactly the same parts so the same samples go to the same parts namely train and test as in previous runs right so okay yeah thank you so much that's a very important point so when we execute this uh split we will see what train data frame row count has three thousand and something clients and test data frame rule count has 700 uh for 47 vines now we have prepared data and split the data now finally we get uh to the training of our model first of all we create this um knife bias model based on the naive bias class from as you have seen one of the imports we did before so it's a part of pi spark machine learning library let's get it back right right here and here we define some things from values we won't change but those um parameters or settings for this model we can change in order to try to improve the results it will be model type multinomial i believe i'm afraid we have no time left to explain those parts and smoothing of one and we will train this model then get the predictions with module transform on the test you remember the test data before you prepare it before and show those predictions i will execute the training it was quite fast because well amount of data is not so high and we can see we have some labels marked for the vines we have here so we can go for show data frame predictions and show only uh qualities we are interested quality label prediction probability good and now finally we can use multi-class classification evaluator to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions on the accuracy we will get in this point and we create this classification evaluator with label column label prediction column prediction and metric name accuracy when we evaluate our set of predictions and preempt test set accuracy test set accuracy is going to be quite low um as we remember it's not the only metric but it may be also important metric for us in this case as this case is different uh we can try to replay this game and to retrain this model changing their parameters but i want we have only 10 minutes left and i want to go on to the next slide because we gonna work with the same set of data using another algorithm take a look this process is an iterative process maybe we chosen the wrong algorithm and we may find something better for our purposes or not let's take a look at the next one let's take a look at the random forest i really like this name by the way random forest sounds a little bit funny at least for me and random forest is a supervised classification and symbol method what is the uh method and why it's not an algorithm why it's ensemble net you will see in a moment as always wiki is very useful no but before we proceed with a random forest let's talk about the decision tree algorithm which is an algorithm not an ensemble method decision tree is a simple representation for classifying assuming what all of the input features have like uh simple answers simplifying that and there is a single target uh classification and each answer have some reasonable limited amount of questions we can try to build a tree of decisions giving us um the results for something we want to predict on the right side of this example you see the titanic survival decision tree so one of the canonical examples you can see if we want to calculate someone to survive or not to survive a probability of that and building a simple decision dream we can try to ask those questions and base it on the answers ask following questions walking through features of something or somewhat someone in this case someone getting the results and the teachers use it for these decision tree for titanic survival percentage rate or prediction rate let's say we will use a very simple set of features gender or sex age and amount of siblings because uh surprisingly enough it matters in this disastrous scenario and then based out of the results because it's a supervised method so we can label we know how many people died and what were they features let's say forgive me these um comparison that will be simple decision tree base it on sex age and amount of siblings for this person and this decision tree iterates through different features in order to calculate the probability for something for example if sex male if age smaller than 9.5 if siblings count is more than um uh 2.5 uh we get to this branch and as a result oh sorry uh yep but uh if h is uh bigger than 9.5 we get to this branch at these points questions are stopped because we already know the answer the highest probability in this case that's quite quite interesting and simple methodic um in general if any of you is are more um familiar with classical programming uh this decision tree can be represented as a set of if else constructions yeah so the conditions are in the nodes and the other if else constructions or exact uh actions or exact labels are in the leaves yeah uh but if you are going to write a decision tree manually you are going to write quite a lot of them for us good side of machine learning is what the model is going to create them estimate them and drop those what are not good enough now interesting point um decision tree is a great idea but it's rarely used directly as a just decision tree uh the problem of it is it tends to be very over fitted trying to guess all the points when you use just the decision tree and as a result we get to the random forest and sample method which gets multiple different decision trees those are trying to give you the same results the same predictions based on different features as a result we solved the problem of overfitted model making it more general because those uh decision trees are random or almost random there are different settings we can have for example some decision trees may have higher weight than the others and there are some different points maybe applied but the general idea is we get a lot of different trees and we use combined result as like two decision trees say yes and one decision tree says no it means for us what result is 66.6 percents for it to be true if every tree has the same weight uh obviously normally we have not the three trees but much more because normally we work with much higher numbers of features so again talk is cheap show me the code let's switch to a next algorithm let's switch to a random tree with the same data set remember our test set accuracy was 0.6 and one more thing you have to remember uh when you just quit uh the [Music] notebook it's kernel it's not shuttered down by default so if you have not so powerful laptop or not so powerful cloud machine if you will ask me for a cloud machine don't forget to shut down your kernels otherwise you will simply run into no free memory issue now kernel is shuttered down no kernel and we can switch to a next uh lab and this one will be as you could guess random forest same data set we are still solving the same problem but now we are applying a new algorithm or ensemble method to try to answer our questions uh what are we trying uh to learn from this data set we are still trying to predict wine quality and meanwhile we will uh try to answer a question can random forest be used to classify a wines rating score by its attributes beginning will be exactly the same i am importing library libraries i need to work with this data and as i you as i use the new uh kernel i will again define this function same function just to show our data i will have to connect to datastax enterprise or apache cassandra in our case create the key space use this key space and create table same table as we have had before and load data same data set as i said one two three four five six seven it's going to be there yes in a moment this step again will be the same we have to create a spark session and read the wine data frame from cassandra it takes some time but now we are done and we can take a look we have the same table and same vines with ascendant basically we use the same files to load the data this step must be familiar to you already i am filtering out vines with a bad quality to focus on their wines with high quality now i'm getting the same vector assembler and basically this step is more or less the same like we did before so i won't explain it again this all may look a little bit too much but it's an overview level workshop don't feel sad and bad if you didn't get it all from the beginning i want to show you an overall picture on how it works answer your questions in the end and then if you are interested we will maybe suggest you some ways to get more data about that maybe in the result you will become a data scientist no dmitry needs for some colleagues um i definitely do yeah yeah uh this uh job is in high demand and this demand will only grow so if you will decide to become a data scientist and you will become at some point please let us know uh if it was just like consequence of this workshop it will be an amazing feedback so we have this training data prepared now we do the same we do the same split we still need train data and test data so it's still the same numbers because we well quite expected now we get to random forest classifier our label column will be labeled features we use to make decision trees uh will be uh features so those we prepared before you remember with those vectors and finally we define the number of trees we need to have that's a very interesting point when we execute the training we create those predictions and let's take a look what we will get as a result boom okay 747 uh predicted that test data at least we didn't have a quality for this server during the training we are now trying to predict what it will be now we can show this data frame with predictions showing quality label prediction and probability and as you could guess we can use multi-class classification evaluator to evaluate accuracy of our predictions and now test accuracy is not 0.6 like it was but closer to 0.7 looks like accuracy significantly changed oh that's quite an interesting point because changing the algorithm doing the same steps with the same dataset we already got different results very much makes sense and you know what as an i'm not an expert in this field in no way but i know i can play with those values in this case i want to change num trees first tries to try to raise them then tries to decrease them dmitri what would you guess really change their accuracy or not i think it will okay uh but uh i'm not sure in which direction but uh depending on how much you will change it and then which in which direction you even change the number yeah makes sense so then probably i can make an assumption we have uh 10 different or around 10 different features in these features columns so first i will try to decrease the number and set it to free i will execute this cell again boom very well i well i may show it but it doesn't really matter because what we want is to evaluate this model and accuracy decreases but actually much less than i expected but it decreased that's interesting and if i will try to set the number of trees to one like it cannot be less than one in the forest you cannot have less than one uh dream yeah and we are getting just a single decision tree in this case right so i'm kind of excluding uh is that right i'm excluding random forest and i'm working with a single decision tree in this case we will yes yeah and take a look in this particular case result even improved that's interesting and i will try to raise this number and what should i try what do you think yeah try 20 20 okay let's try 20 run we've had 10 already so just doubling the number and i will re-estimate it okay 0.7 not bad already better when it was with 10 but what if i try to go let's say for 100 i have no idea if it will improve the result but now we can take a look on what accuracy will say and accuracy actually decreased uh as we have seen too much is sometimes also bad okay so we tried to tune our model and it looks like uh we get we are getting different results we should also mention that there are a lot of other uh parameters to that class and we can also uh change the depths of the tree uh the num maximum number of leaves that are coming out of a single node and there are just many other parameters that can affect the the results of the evaluation of the model yeah i'm afraid we are we are already five minutes out of time uh so i what we suggest you as uh we invite you to follow us edu and do this work then that's going to be for you to experiment read the documentation on random forest classifier which is a part of uh i believe pisces random forest classifier right so in the past park documentation you can find other options for random forest crucifier and try to play with it and surprise us but you by by your raising accuracy as you know already accuracy is maybe not the most important metric but it all depends on your particular case that brings us to the last few slides we will answer questions in a couple of minutes so last slides don't forget this wednesday we built a multiplayer game or a game with real time interactions using event streaming it's prepared by my colleague stefano lettini and it's an amazing one as an insider i've played this game already and build it and that's a great job so i do suggest you to join and make yourself familiar with event streaming and next week next wednesday we build an appointment scheduling up using spring.flux and nosql database sprint means java so uh if you are interested in java that's definitely going to be a good place for you and of course no sql is uh very important for anyone who wants to be a good engineer to understand okay uh final point to run it locally use uh use the link we have sent already data stacks academy machine learning workshop online uh for the cloud setup contact meme i will put it again i believe you already did data starts dot io slash alex i will be happy to help you with that and if you have any questions find us on discord one last point data stacks is well known for its support development of apache cassandra one of the best databases in the modern world but apache cassandra world has one big problem it needs you the story is we need world need more qualified engineers with experience in cassandra than it currently has so our idea we sponsor education and certification for you to become a certified experienced apache cassandra developer or administrator that means what you can get education in this field and certify you and pass the certification for free without paying a cent uh first thing to do so you need to do two things first you follow this link and there is my youtube right here you follow this link wow sure to get your uh voucher which will give you 100 percent discount for apache cassandra certification a second one is going to be the place for you to get ready for the exam because obviously you cannot do it right now you have to prepare yourself first best place for it to prefer is academy.datastarts.com where you have free courses for that to get ready for the exam and by the way currently they are available only in english but we work to deliver subtitles in multiple languages work has started so hopefully over the next months it will be deliberate and you will have multiple options what matters for you the most there is an admin administrator path or developer learning path it's the best way and there are also information about kafka connection to cassandra and so on and so forth good so that must be enough for that moment i have don't uh wait for too long to get your voucher the form will be closed after some hours and uh thank you for visiting us we will be happy to answer some questions if any there is a point from messi dc cluster stops when running docker compose up so cannot do the exercises in the notebook so uh most take a look all these um that of the things we are using today is quite heavy it's like production like workloads so if it cannot be executed on your laptop especially if you use windows or osx first check resources allocated for your docker because it's obviously going to require quite a lot of resources if you cannot launch your um those exercises on your machine you know what to do ping me on linkedin or via email and i will create a machine for you in the cloud which will have linux and enough resources to execute them those steps any more questions or we are done for today uh yeah i i also wanted to address the question about the differences between k-means and k-nearest neighbors if this is still relevant yeah sure of course uh please remind the question first question was what's the difference between k-means and uh closest neighbor algorithm right yes um so the difference is that k-means is obviously a clustering algorithm and what it does is that it doesn't use label data to train the model and it in fact it uses the training data to find those labels in some in some sense so it finds clusters which are labels for our data so it shows uh which sample belongs to which cluster this is a kind of a label so it finds those tables and the k nearest neighbors algorithm is um otherwise is a classifying or a regression algorithm and you have the labels at your trading step so you already know which label to which label belongs each sample and so what you do is you're um learn the underlying function to um do the same for any new data so i hope that explains something yeah i think so uh one more question was asked in the very beginning but uh really great question could you recommend any resources for machine learning articles books for beginners and so on um uh if there are any other questions then um proceed with them and i will think and look for questions not at the moment there are a lot of sources and it is really difficult to choose the best ones okay but we need at least something um well um i remember that good fellows book is very good but it's as far as i remember it's generally about deep learning so if you need something about machine learning like classical machine learning and it should be in english i can't remember any right now maybe if you can contact me in some way i can you can paste the link to your linkedin if you use it or you can send me yeah wait a second here it goes thank you in a moment machine learning by tom mitchell i can say what i took a machine learning course uh by udacity it was a great experience so um personally i believe it was a great course yep i remembered you know what uh there's a great book by bishop i believe i don't remember its correct name let me just google it quickly okay pattern it's called pattern recognition and machine learning authored by the bishop yeah pattern recognition and machine learning christopher and bishop right yes this is a very great book and uh good for uh starting in this area okay let me send you a link oh it's going to be an amazon punk dia because i'm located in germany but i hope you can adjust this link to your needs pattern recognition and machine learning great okay maybe this one i believe there should be in your publications but yeah okay so if there are no more questions we are done for today i have to say many many many thank you that those dozens of people who stayed with us till the end i hope we manage it to show you the very fundamentals approaches and use cases and now you can say if you are interested in this subject or not and as i said before if as a result you will get your job in data science field please let us know it's always an incredible feedback to know what people want what people who are interested and made it till the very end uh thank you thank you viper thank you for your gratitude um if you liked it uh please there is a there are buttons right below dmitry like and subscribe we run a lot of great workshops on this channel data stacks developers and of course we will invite dmitry again on other sessions to help us live we always happy to have external speakers thank you it was a pleasure yeah it was a great pleasure to host you here and thank you for support thank you everyone for visiting it was a great time together and hope to see you on wednesday have great uh have fun and have a great week it's monday so use this week and it's full go do something great with that that was alex and dmitry thank you so much and i'll see you again later all the best a little bit of music for you in the end [Music] to change [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music]",
