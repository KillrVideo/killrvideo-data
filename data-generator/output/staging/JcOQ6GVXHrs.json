    "text": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hi there this is David Hardy let's dig into some gremlin dsls in Java so a set of assumptions first we are using the killer video reference application in this segment and if you don't know what that is I suggest you take a look at killer video github do and click the get started button to get up to speed even if you decide not to do that just know that all the code and examples I'm about to show you are available in our killer video github repo you'll find all the links below in the description another assumption is that we are using data stacks enterprise not only for our cluster but for the drivers as well all of the configuration and DSL examples are using those drivers the last assumption is we are extending our existing application to add graph and gremlin Tia sells the base Cassandra capability with DSC is already in place and we are also using maven for dependency management so first things first what's a DSL it's a domain-specific language and it takes our beautifully expressive and sometimes verbose gremlin traversals and encodes them in a language relevant to your domain so what does that mean well before I start digging into this let's take a look at steam Miletus awesome blog post on this very subject there he explains in detail what DSL czar why to use them and give some really nice examples don't worry I'll wait yeah go ahead pause the video and check it out okay well hopefully you're right and if not no worries you can read it later I would also be remiss if I didn't point out three highs gremlin compendium it is an excellent resource for those of you wrapping your heads around the gremlin language okay why don't we jump into a simple example let's take a look at the gremlin traversal on the left see that we have GV has some patient buy some ID now look at the traversal on the right dr. dot patients with the ID so this is the traversal in our DSL this is this is an example just a very simple example of how we're using our DSL in this case maybe it is in the domain of a doctor's office or a medical application or something like that but notice that it is in the language of that domains of doctor dot patients and we're passing that ID now to note the traversal you see there on the left that Gigi has patient all of those implementation details are actually within our DSL right but it just puts it in a more human readable language that again is relevant to our domain this is just a really simple example now in order to give you a more complex example we need to get in some code so before we do that let's take a look at a couple of items you need to get your DSL set up so let's start with a pom.xml and ensure the DC version is 1.4 dot zero or above and since we are adding graph and DSL support to our existing drivers all we have to do is add this little section down here for DC Java driver graph yeah that's it so you can find this in the documentation as well here and we'll provide a link on the page that gave us the capability to work with graph and dsls now we need to configure our cluster and enable our application to talk to our graph through our DSL so let's take a look at the DC configuration class and notice this small little section right here and this is the small little section to configure our graph now something to point out here I skipped over a lot of code in this and really what's going on is in our particular case DSC configuration is where we handle all the basic cluster configuration and such an initialize DSC is where that the method exactly where that happens in the beginning part here all I'm really doing is connecting up to our nodes we're taking a look at any username and password you know like just configuring this kind of stuff but really when I want to point out here is to enable graph and even graph with DSL all we needed was this little section to add on to our existing cluster config right so we're just using the with graph options there again this is covered in the documentation that I just referenced so what I want to point out though is note the references right to our graph name the the recommendation graph name here and the timeout so let's take a look here look at the recommendation graph name this killer video video recommendations now we've got the name here right but nowhere in the code am I actually creating the graph I'm just referencing it so where is it well killer video uses a bootstrap to create any needed schemas before everything starts up so we're making an assumption the graph is there here's the Greece script that we're using to create the killer video video recommendations graph now obviously your schema will most likely look different than ours but this is you know this should give you an idea of at least a working example that includes some graph options keys vertex and edge labels and some indexes okay also note the timeout and I'll scroll up here and show that our timeout is set to 30 seconds okay this is especially important with graph and I strongly suggest you set a timeout graph traversals can be tricky at times and you can set up at rehearsal that either takes a very long time to return or continues on forever unless you are very well-versed with gremlin I suggest you always test your traversals out in the gremlin console or something like DZ studio before you implement code okay great we have our basic cluster config all set for graph now let's set up the reference to our DSL I'm gonna scroll down and we're gonna go to this section here ok yep that's it ok I might be glossing over a little bit here so if at this point you didn't read the remand ESL's in Java blog post by Steven mullet that I mentioned earlier i really suggest you do that now if not you're just gonna have to trust me on this next part all right so notice the killer variable I'm setting to my traversal source here now this is all explained in the docs down that I mentioned earlier in the DSL section alright so reference those ok so what we're gonna do is I'm going to pass the dias each session that we just created I'm gonna pass that to my get traversal source method and I'm also gonna pass in my traversal source class this will now set up the traversal source with the DSL using the application so let's stop for a moment and take a look at what's going on notice the reference to killer video traversal source class here well if you take a look at the DSL template classes in my graph folder right you might notice there is no killer video traversal source there are however the killer video traversal DSL and killer video traversal source DSL classes so one of the really neat things that DSL support in Java does is generate boilerplate code if we take a look at the DSL template we have up here notice the gremlin DSL annotation here at the top so when I compile it's going to generate the needed classes and to illustrate this I'm gonna run it clean to remove any of my generated classes let's go ahead and do that I just want you to see this so we're gonna clean nose here right the reference classes are now gone because they're no longer generated I will go ahead and compile give that a moment and notice what happens when I do this right that the killer video traversal source class was now missing right according to the IDE and then BAM right there you just saw it come back again right so there you go so what this all really comes down to is you need to have your DSL defined before you can set it to be your traversal source makes sense when I say it out loud so one last thing before we move on for those of you who previously used G for your traversal source you know now you're deciding you're going to take a crack at dsls you might be curious what's the difference right so we take a look at what we had in place before using DSL we're just using this simple travursel source so we're essentially going to replace this with our DSL reference again this is covered in the documentation I mentioned earlier so now we have our configuration all in place so now let's go to the fun of defining our DSL in our case this is defined in our DSL template classes killer video traversal DSL and killer video traversal source at dsl notice as well the killer video traversal constants class now this is just a good idea because we end up reusing so many of the same names and it's good to keep them in one place we also don't want to repeat all those strings again your class names and definitions will most likely be different than mine but this should be a good starting place to see how all this works all righty finally into the actual template as I mentioned before DSL czar an abstraction on top of your base gremlin traversals so in killer video our domain is videos notice how the names of our methods all fit within that context things like rated and we scroll down here a little bit we'll have watched and uploaded right and so on so let's focus here on uploaded notice how we see a regular traversal for the most part this is something I might run in the gremlin console or in something like Daz studio the difference here though is instead of having to type out and execute a traversal like this in my code all I need to do is call the uploaded method let's also look at something else the DSL allows us to do yeah let's go up to rated here okay and notice how I can set some validation here up front now something to explain about this validation in this particular case in killer video our rating scale for videos goes from 0 to 5 so if you take a look at the validation you'll see that it's really kind of checking to ensure that we're in those constraints from 0 to 5 now if I were to just run this directly in gremlin right and I didn't have the DSL setup and let's say that you know I had a brain fart that day and I forgot that my rating scale to 0-5 or if I just didn't realize that I thought was 0 to 10 or something and I put in a value of 8 now from the traversal sense it's totally valid right it's it's there's no issue with that but from the data sense I don't have any data to back that up so when I execute that traversal I'm not gonna get any results back right so in this case it's essentially ensuring that we are getting the values of the parameters that we expect you know just a real simple example right now also notice that we can slightly change the traversal right here depending on what the input parameters are all while just calling rated within my code so this is actually kind of really nice again from the implementation standpoint when using my DSL all I have to worry about is calling rated all the details are within I don't have to worry about writing this out in my traversal putting this kind of logic in there or anything like that so again I pass in my input parameters and I can say make changes and and put some validation in place and it's all hidden and kind of you know seamless from the point of the DSL okay all right so at this point you might want an example to put all this together so let's take a look at our subscriber method YouTube video added and as you might expect from the name this is executed when we add a video to killer video so when adding a video to our graph I need to get or create a video vertex at an uploaded edge between the video and the user who uploaded it get our add any tag vertices and then add tag with edges from each of those tags back to a video so that's not too difficult but there's a lot going on there if we take a look at my traversal you can clearly see killer video add uploaded and killer video add tag with this is the traversal implemented within the domain of my DSL now let's take a look at the gremlins versal underneath the DSL and break it down okay so this first portion here is what is encoded within the killer video ad uploaded section in our code this okay so I'm just gonna do that again this first portion here's the gremlin traversal and then here is the DSL okay now let's take a look at the second portion the second portion here is what is encoded within the killer video add tagged with action okay we're gonna do that one more time I'm gonna go back here's the second portion here right so this traversal right these steps are encoded with an Ag tag with okay just a little further let's go back to killer video ad uploaded and see what it's doing in the DSL alright so we have a killer video ad uploaded and we are going to start with video okay so I want to talk to this a little bit notice the parameters that we have here if we take a look at the implementation you'll see the parameters that we're passing in now this part of it in in our DSL this is actually defining this is the part that's actually checking to see does the video exist if it doesn't going ahead and adding and adding any properties handled like insert updates that kind of deal we have the normal validation like we talked about before right here's what I want to point out notice this traversal here right looks awfully similar to what is going on here and it should because this DSL is generating is essentially generating this part of the traversal right so that's what's going on here when we say killer video we're handling for the video now there's add we're gonna skip over that for a moment and we're gonna come back to it right but I'm gonna move on to uploaded so let's take a look at uploaded we're gonna scroll down uploaded okay so notice within uploaded how we have references to both uploaders and user right so what we can do is we can actually in in the definition of our DSL in our methods we can actually reference other methods right and each of these has a contained set of functionality right they perform a specific function also notice how method names are generally mapped to the vertices and edges in our schema now before I start explaining this would probably help if I show this scheme and let's talk to that a little bit okay here is the schema for our graph now notice that nouns are vertices like user video and tag right and the verbs are actions that map to edges like uploaded and tagged with right now to be clear your schema may be set up a little bit differently and this is fine but in this case the intent is make the DSL read just like our schema does so someone familiar with the schema should have no problem understanding what is happening and this is what I mean by our DSL encoding gremlin in the language of our domain so if I were to look at my schema and see video tag with tag right I can now go into my code base and I can write code that reads just like that okay and it kind of emphasized a couple things here again so again we have our vertices our user video and tag vertices and then we have the edges so these edges are in our case these are the relationships were forming between those vertices right so user can rate video user can upload video and video can be tagged with tag and if you notice generally in the language right that we have here I've killer video ad uploaded notice the reference and killer video ad tagged with so the the key thing there is that I'm in my particular case I'm trying to ensure that the DSL matches the language right of our schema and and that's that's one of the benefits you you get here I should also point out if you look at the DSL template itself right you'll see that the method names uploaded user right they're matching generally as close as I can to what's actually in this schema so again it's kind of like a one-to-one match okay so remember I skipped over the add earlier the add method earlier and I said were to come back to that let's do that so I'm gonna scroll down here and let's take a look at it notice I have add right killer video add uploaded and then add tag with so add in this case is actually just a side effect I'm not gonna go into detail and what side effect is other than it lets us chain commands so this is just a good example of how you can use a DSL to make your traversals more human readable and easier to understand as compared to having to figure out a traversal like this one last thing before we wrap up is our particular schema and DSL design are not absolutes your schema in your domain may differ quite a bit from what we have here but hopefully this gives you an idea of how to get started into some dsl awesomeness oh okay so that was a lot of info everything I've shown you today is available from our killer video github repo and the documentation provided in the description I hope you've got something out of the segment on Bremond ESL's in java Thanks",
