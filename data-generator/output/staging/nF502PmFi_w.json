    "text": "hey welcome everyone good morning good evening good night wherever you are on the planet today is a new workshop very special for me brand new content we will discuss about getting started with pulsar i'm cedric linven i'm leading the developer advocacy team at datastax and today with me a very special guest jonathan hi jonathan hi cedric so i'm you know super pumped to have you on screen with me today so jonathan for who's who don't know is the co-founder and the cto of tadastax he was the apache cassandra protector for seven years what we call the pmc is expecting distributed system a guru in in java and he likes to wear red shirts do you i i think he nailed that he's also my boss so i will try to not do too many cheesy jokes for tonight uh i i love my job i want to keep it so let's get rolling and see uh let's get what we do have for today so a little bit of housekeeping as usual we are live both on youtube and twitch twitch is really just a backup there is not a lot of people monitoring twitch but if we get some hiccups with the bandwidth maybe we need to switch to switch you do have the twitch links in the description below if you want to ask us some questions decision needs to be live we need you guys you will do exercise we you will ask questions so to ask this question you can either use the youtube chat so uh i'm watching the youtube jonathan as well and also a member of the attack screw it's not only me and janet on screen we also have the discord room with more than 9 000 people there so it's pretty neat because when the stream ends the youtube chat ends with the stream and if you want to keep interacting with us go and subscribe to the discord room and uh we can keep in touch also in the discord if you get stuck there we do have breakout rooms to help you 101 and you know in the youtube chat sometimes is scrolling so fast that we cannot catch your questions all right i told you we want this session to be interactive so we will ask you question lives and to do so we are using a tool called mentee meter and in a minute i will ask you to go to another website mentee.com open a new tab in your browser enter a code and we will start asking you question just to assess you know what you expect from the session when it comes to amazon you don't have to install anything we will do four labs and we will use only software as a service product no need for you to install anything but you will see even without installing anything you will do a lot of stuff so four tools to to use today uh cassandra in the cloud star in the cloud with to implement some architecture and also a id in the cloud name eatpod thank you cedric we've got some really exciting hands-on work to do but since this is our our first pulsar workshop i wanted to start by giving a little bit of background of what pulsar is and and why data stacks is so interested in it that we acquired a pulsar as a service company and and we're you know hiring uh steadily to to grow that team pulsar was open sourced by yahoo in 2016 as a distributed streaming platform and it's really started to hit its stride in the last 12 to 18 months so it became a top-level apache project three years ago and then uh you know it's it's slowly kind of gathered some some of its first uh champions in the open source world and now there's you know dozens of fortune 5000 companies using it and it's really going from like oh this is something this could be an interesting niche to oh this could run my business so some of the the things that are are most interesting about it are the bottom three bullets on this slide where first it does both pub sub and queuing it splits compute from storage which enables a better scaling story and then finally it's it does geo replication it does multi-tenancy and it does a bunch of things that make it a good fit not only with cassandra but with any cloud native architecture next slide please so pulsar is a distributed uh system and it's got three components in that stack so in the upper right zookeeper manages the metadata of the cluster so it it knows who uh the the bookkeepers are and what ledgers we have stored on each bookkeeper we don't directly store uh message data on zookeeper that would make zookeeper a bottleneck and we don't want that but we use it to track where the data lives in our storage system the storage system is at the bottom of the diagram here it's called bookkeeper and bookkeeper nodes are called bookies for short and then in the middle we have the pulsar brokers themselves which are what talk to the clients the clients are the producers and consumers and they take that logical model of topics and messages and turn it into storage that can be assigned to the the bookkeeper nodes next slide please here we go so importantly uh when we store data on bookkeeper we break it up into multiple ledgers and segments and for people coming from the cassandra world i know a lot of you have cassandra experience uh the third bullet here where it says the producer acknowledges when the quorum of bookies acknowledge the message so the quorum and pulsar is is different from a quorum in cassandra cassandra uses a kind of an eventual consistency model uh and you and you can use a quorum of rights and quorum of reads to make sure that you are always seeing the most recent right to a given row pulsar uses the same word to mean something different pulsar designs for uh full consistency serializable consistency and so when you're creating a pulsar topic you can tell it how many nodes you want how many bookkeeper nodes you want to stripe the storage for that topic across and then how many of those nodes need to respond to consider that message durable so it's not about consistency the way it is in cassandra it's about durability and how many uh you know how many uh hardware failures do you want to be proof against next slide so i mentioned that that uh i was going to talk about some of these advantages of pulsar and i did this investigation personally a few months ago when i was trying to figure out what streaming technology data stacks should invest in and what would be the best complement to cassandra to help our customers and the apache cassandra community so i was looking for some specific advantages and these are what pulsar brings to the table better than anyone else out there and i'm going to go into each of these in a little more detail next slide so the first is that pulsar handles both pub sub and queuing and so the difference is that in a published subscribe system you want to have a one-to-many relationship where i'm putting messages on a topic and then anyone can subscribe to that topic and get their own copy of that full message log versus in a queuing system you want to have more of a load balancing effect you want you want to say i want to have this message handled by someone but i kind of don't care who and no no subscriber is going to get all of the messages because they're going to be load balanced across all the subscribers next slide so here's what that looks like in in pulsar nomenclature where in in the pulsar world we represent both uh pub sub and queuing with this model of a topic but then we can subscribe to the topic in different ways to get those different behaviors so the top model here with the shared subscription that's going to be your queuing model where pulsar will share the messages in that topic across all of the consumers that participate in that subscription and then the middle one there with exclusive subscription that's going to be your classic pub sub where every consumer that subscribes to that using that subscription will get their their own copy of that uh data and then at the bottom pulsar also supports a third model called a failover subscription which lets you have uh the benefits of uh an exclusive subscription that only one consumer is processing these but it builds in a high availability model where if that consumer dies pulsar will immediately start sending them uh to a to a backup instead next slide another advantage that was important for for pulsar is it's building in of geo-replication out of the box so this is something that cassandra does better than any database in the world and so anyone any messaging or streaming system that doesn't do this is going to be an awkward fit with cassandra and uh there's a lot of alternatives kafka for instance famously does geo-replication as a client-side add-on and it's uh it it's not super reliable pulsar builds geo-replication into the core server and it it's it's bulletproof uh so in this diagram i'm showing how we have a single topic a and that is replicated to multiple clusters to three different clusters and we have producers and consumers writing to and reading from that topic simultaneously across all those clusters next slide yes so um for us for people asking in the chat so producer is really just an application sending message and consumer is an application reading message right so so the mod the data model here is a topic is a sequence of messages and so we want to we want to preserve ordering within that topic and as an implementation detail you because ordering is expensive uh you can split up a topic into multiple partitions and then we'll guarantee ordering within each of those partitions but not across those partitions so pulsar gives you a uh a model of a sequential event log or a message bus or anything that can be a sequence of uh events or messages that that's what that's what you would use pulsar for yes and correct me if i'm wrong but here you can read and write from everywhere and it will be replicated i mean you can write in the topic from producer 2 in cluster 2 and the message would be available in cluster 1 cluster 3. exactly ok they're just spotting jumping on questions in the slide okay move on uh a third advantage of pulsar is that it it's designed for multi-tenancy and so what that allows you to have is a more cost-effective deployment that you can share across multiple teams across multiple applications and that applies to its geo-replication as well so there's there's a typo on the slide here it says region one on the left and regions one on the right uh that should be region one and region two but i can have a common set of tenants across both of those regions that i'm managing from a single admin interface next slide and then i mentioned that separating the compute and storage the way pulsar does allows it to have a better scaling story and and here's why i'm gonna i'm gonna pick on kafka a little bit because that's a system that a lot of people are familiar with and in in kafka each broker or rather each partition is assigned to a single leader broker and then it's replicated to a set of follower brokers but that that constraint that each partition belongs to or is is led by a single broker means that if i want to add capacity to my cluster if i want to add new brokers to the cluster i need to move some of those partitions to the new broker before it can start assuming the load associated with it so adding a new broker to a overloaded kafka cluster makes it slower before it makes it faster because i'm generating cpu network and disk load on those existing brokers to move that data to the new one to send that data over next slide so this is uh we uh go ahead one more so this is where that uh abstraction layer in pulsar uh solves that problem for us and so i've diagrammed this here with zookeeper at the bottom what this is indicating is that because we break partitions of data into multiple ledgers we have flexibility on where we can store those ledgers and so in this case i've got ledgers one two three and four on an existing bookie storage node and i have a new storage node join the cluster i don't have to move any of that data to the new one i can just start storing new ledger five on the new bookie immediately and having that abstraction layer lets me do that uh and and you know add that capacity without impacting the latency of the clients that are reading and writing to the cluster while this is going on next slide and that's that's the 10 minute introduction to to pulsar and i'll turn it over to cedric for our first lab where you'll get to experience producing and consuming messages hey hey wait wait wait wait wait not so funny no no you have tons of questions for you jonathan okay in the chat no um first question is uh regarding coram so your topic can live on a multiple region with the jio replication so is there any chrome or column of code when you use this replication with pulsar so your your your each region is independent in the sense that uh so i said that what we're going to guarantee ordering within a partition we're going to guarantee ordering within a partition um within a region so if i'm writing to the i'll back up and add a footnote to that you can actually do synchronous replication across regions in which case i will guarantee uh sequential message production across all the regions because they're waiting for acknowledgement from the other regions before allowing another message to be added that's not recommended unless your regions are very close together just because of the speed of light delay so the more common way to configure it is to do asynchronous replication in which case each region will each region's messages will be guaranteed to be serial uh within that region but then once you start mixing it with the other regions uh that region's messages could be consumed in a different order okay makes sense but it will be the same it will so one more it will be the same order in all the regions no matter where it's consumed so if i have message one two and three produced in cluster one in that order the consumers in cluster two will also see messages one two and three but they may see other messages in between that were produced in cluster two that's the distinction i'm trying to make got you got you okay one one last question we add is uh is ledgers like partition and i think these uh schema already illustrate that a partition is really a ledger map it's one to end partition is already an abstraction made at zookeeper level so zookeeper metadata bookkeeper bookie data and so at the zookeeper level you do you do have the abstraction what is a partition yeah you can think of a ledger as a chunk of a partition okay got you okay well uh no more questions so i guess it's your turn you at home to start working and do start doing the first labs okay and you know i keep getting your question and we will answer the question uh ongoing so today all the as usual all the instructions are in the github repo and this time we used the wiki part of the github repo to provide you a nice table of contents on the right part and as you can see we will do getting started cask data stacks and even streaming for labs and this the first lab is uh using katakura so i think people are sharing the github link with all you now on on on the youtube chat but it's github.com data stacks dash academy slash workshop pulsar okay in here you simply go to open the labs and it will open the wiki so prerequisites i told you that there is no need for you to install anything yet we will use some tools online so you need to sign in um and it would be good to have a github account and that's that's all the thing you need just a github account and so uh let's get started i click start and i'm moving to lab number one and um i will give you 15 minutes for you to go with lab number one um if you cannot finish everything in the 15-minute time slot it's not a big deal the session is recorded and you can do that on your own pace it should be self-service i mean i should have provided you enough information to do the exercise on your own but if you have any question of course i'm here to answer on the youtube chat um one note katakura tool not work very well on the brave brother which broke some cookies so to do the labs number one uh please use either firefox or chrome or a latest generation browser and so what we ask you to do is to open that page which is all the courses from data stacks using katakura and even i probably can go up one level to for you to see all the courses we are providing using katakura uh so it's there is a lot see you can use astra migration data modeling kubernetes and it's all free you can go there and start start learning but for today of course we are targeting pulsar and even in the pulsar sub folder we do have five scenarios today i want you to do the first exercise and if you uh are faster than the other you can go and start the second one so let's go and start the scenario so you have noticed anything but now i'm using chrome so i will go start scenario and it's again explained in the in the github but that's very very simple you simply start the scenario everything is started for you so it will download and open what you need to make that work and you can go step by step over the scenario okay so i told you 15 minutes and i'll let you go through all the steps and give us a thumb up in the youtube chat when you are done yes and as stated in the youtube chat if you are using a brave you can disable the shields should be okay and now katakuda starts calling data sucks hey guys i see 12 100 people start using the same scenario at the same time yes let's go let's go and david if you aim me i think you can start playing some soft music for let's say 10 minutes because i'm the only one here who not listening to music this is how we set the music anyway i will start dancing on my own no no please stay focused and run the the catacola scenario it should be very step by step [Music] [Music] [Music] so do okay so robert already told us he's done with the catacoda cool you can keep going categorize free you can keep looking at what's happening of course it's pretty fast you simply click on the on the command and it will start super fast yeah but you know take your time just really understand which steps you are doing startup is very slow yeah you know katakuri is eating okay so i see some people starting waiting for katakura to start okay that's okay cool good feedback see mine i started now let's do it now i'm downloading okay thank you sani kuya in hope you enjoy um if you finish this first you can try start the second one and so forth and so on they are working all the same you don't have to install anything and it's more and more content regarding pizza and i in seven minutes i will uh go back a little bit to slides and move on to the next portion see look at that my not so downloading to start ages i try that let's say huh i tried that uh this morning it was super super fast and i guess like everybody's now downloading pursa and it's slow we need to show them how to build a content delivery network with cassandra yeah yes yes and that's the future you know now when we when we are using you know the jam stack and the new way to build apps which simply push static content into into cdm um you know what i really feel like cassandra could be considered as a ddn data distributed network because with cassandra you can install node in data center close to your customers and you reduce the latency not only between your app and the static resources you are using but also your app and the data and data is really distributed and you can read and read from everywhere so i like to see customer as you know distributed data network ddn yeah my new acronym yeah yeah so for rate uh it's not it's not uh you shouldn't have any issue with the command that's really you really need to wait for a comment to end before go to to the others since everyone's kind of in the same boat waiting uh for for this download uh could we get started on astra and cask account creation and kind of multitask i agree with you i simply say uh let's wait until 45 because i guess a lot of people are in the catacoda right now and i would like to avoid any context switching um and you know if i cannot download it it's not a big deal you can go back and do and do the exercise so let's wait you know five more minutes um and let's do that okay but if you are you can move on and you know you can start working on lab two and start following this instruction for lab two we are not using katakura so you are not stuck you need you don't need to complete lab 1 to go to lab 2. so while while we're waiting i'll just throw out one thing uh for for people to think about as they look at open source projects like pulsar and cassandra that uh you know most people think of uh you know contributing to these projects in terms of like writing code and submitting patches but there's like a whole iceberg of other stuff that these projects need uh besides code patches so uh i submitted a documentation patch to to pulsary yesterday that was my first contribution to to pulsar um and so like that's something that you can get started in at with a much smaller time investment than uh you know actually uh you know adding a feature to the code base so if you're thinking about like hey it would be cool to to contribute to some of these uh apache projects that that i use uh starting with like the the documentation or improving the uh getting started experience like that that those are appreciated every bit as much as as new code and i'm reading the question so if you get the warning regarding nash or that will be deprecated this is expected we are using a gdk 9 and nash on will be duplicated in i think next decay removed and replaced by grav vfgs yes yes yeah the the images there are uh running on jdk8 i believe and so they're uh updating those is a work in progress indeed and this is mostly this first scenario that i'm using on gdk8s and later others have been upgraded okay so download it down i will enter and if you have some issue telling you that the folder does not exist it's probably because you did not let katakura enter the archive before clicking on continue again you really need to wait for the instructions so now look i have been moved to the apache pulisar okay so let's go continue i will go to bin and i will start pulsar in standalone mode and see an error file did it oh insufficient memory in the gm too many people not enough space i guess we broke things with too many people on katakura today uh why the speaker have this issue you know it should be anyway let's move forward it's time it's 45 let's move okay all right so to took back to the slides it was lab number one katakura see you have more scenario to run at your own pace and this is free we may run into some troubles today because too many people using the same scenario okay lab number two will be regarding kesk so datastax acquired kesk a couple of weeks ago and it has been announced last week publicly available we launched luna streaming so now if you install if you work with pulsar data strikes provides support on pulsar open source this is all all the lunar products you know luna was by the support for cassandra open source luna streaming support for pulsar so we're providing support for pulsar then we provided a way to coordinate cassandra and pulsar it's called a sync and i will go back to that in the end zone right after that cask as a software as a service kesk.com and this is what we will use in lab number two and also in the lunar streaming offer we we provide you some help charts to run not only pulsars and all the components but also prometheus and and including some pretty nice dashboards to tell you how buki zookeeper pulsar behave all information about the brokers and which is nice with kubernetes chart is it's all including in the manifest so this is a new offer announced last week um by the nasdaq's luna streaming uh so during the first labs scenario you downloaded the oss pulsar so now let's go and check out kesk so and you know before before doing actually the exercise we will just introduce you a few concepts but remember very few slide uh and go ends on and so on and then but first with the slides we had before introduced to producer and consumer just go back to the definition producer is really the application that will send message to the broker it's not difficult to create you say for the producer that client client which is the object that is connected to the pulsar cluster new producer provide the topic so the the place where all the messages are stored create and now you can start sending objects into that i miss parentheses closing parentheses to make that call compile i guess um at the producer level you do have the local message queue and that will um send a message as uh as fast as this game the producer can batch messages so in pulsar entry which is a final granite granular granularity in object in the pulsar world you can have multiple messages and so the entry is you know one uh one right and it could be a multiple message sent as a batch by the producer on the other side we do have a consumer uh okay reading the message and creating some subscription jonathan introduces you the different subscription available so shared share key exclusive and depending on which subscription you used you will be alone consuming your message you will consume message been on the dedicated key just to ensure ordering of the message okay and do not lose do not lose any message and the subscription is a cursor on the contrary of gms when you consume a message from a topic it will not disappear it's still there so if a new consumer show app by default the cursor is at the latest place in the topic and it will only receive the latest but if you tell the consumer no no no i want you to start at the beginning of the topic so you will put the upset at the beginning then it will start reading all the message in the topic okay so you know read to slide pretty quickly just for you to understand what is a producer and the consumer and the topic and this is now what i want you to do so you will use cask case.com and step by step you will first create a tenant which is your case environment then you will create a topic in there and i ask you to use the topic name astra why because at the end of the session we will write data into astra no surprise and then we will create a producer in java a consumer in java okay see the message coming on the ui try to send messages and with lab 2 you will have producer and consumer sending on the cask and see results at the casc level okay so it could be up to 40 minutes let's try to make it faster let's say 30 minutes and again if you do have question i'm here to to answer a question and let's say in 10 minutes i will start doing it myself just to for you to show you the the steps all right so i will stay like that and see you back in 10 minutes do yeah i see that jonathan answering question live cool okay okay i think you all creating your turnout now so after ddos catacoda let's ddos cask yeah the old ace ate us now okay so um it's um it's it's written there but you know for the name of the tenant um the name of the tenant should be unique in the data center so i pick astradimo so this one is now taken by me so simply pick another one uh with your own maybe pseudonym or something this tenant name is not part of the connection uh it's simply for you to know what's what's happening so try to pick the us west to data center because the default settings use this guy but it's not mandatory you can pick whatever you like but you would have to change the keys i mean the values for some settings um but if you are using us west 2 now use your own tenant name and not mine i see make sense so question when you create a topic in katakura well on the next step in the cataclysm scenario you will be you will execute some pulsar admin command to list the existing topic and so you will see if your topic is exist or not um but when you do that by your command line with pulsar admin you should have a topic created in the response okay two minutes to go so create your tenant with your own name provide us with two next accept determine condition another one that nobody has to read yes this one and just the last screen is really a summary screen and you simply click to confirm yeah and the team is working with katakura it should it should be unblocked now sounds but you know keep moving with the with the demo just try to cover all the content and you can go back at your face on the category do the scenario should be smooth okay see how nice i am i give you a screenshot to click on let's go when it's sweetened let's go yeah i could remove these i guess okay so step three is discover your cluster if i go there and see my dashboard this is a tenant name i use kesk astra demo so if i put my mouse over here i do have the email address i'm using and now everybody knows my email address this is a data center i'm using you can see here and remember this topic remember geo look geo replication could eventually leave on if i create a topic i can make it live on multiple uh location like that so my cluster can be accessed in multiple ways so binary pulsar protocol pulsar ssl 6651 or pure http or websocket api and you know today we will use the first and the segment okay so this is step three if i go now to plan manage we are using a free tier and which is nice is you did not provide any credit card to work with this plan it will be the same with astra i feel that pretty cool to ken to to be able to use the service without paying anything it's a free tier note credit card so pretty good next is let's show the clusters we do have so if you uh created the if you finished the lab number one using katakuda you may have time to create the cluster and name space and topic here is the same a cluster can have multiple namespace and a namespace can have multiple topics and in the topics you will have multiple producer consumer and subscriptions so my tenants and my cluster have already some components in there so one topic but you should start with no topic and everything's zero except the namespace because by default you do have a namespace which is local dash and the name of the data center you are in and see this is the name of my tenants okay all right so i did cluster i click namespace to show the namespace now it's time to create a topic and as i show you on the slide i will create a topic named astra so let's do that on the topic okay you will add a topic use the namespace provide the topic name and provide the different values if i go here to the astra which is already created here you see that i do have the url to access the full name and more information so here this is storage so my topic as of today it's not empty and i'm using 250k but it's still 0 and i do have a consumer but not producer so i will explain you what it means you create the topic providing the astra name okay and there is nothing in there by default so with this empty topic what we want to do is create a producer to start sending stuff with the java code i show you just before you don't need to know java okay it just code you will run if you can understand that's better but it's not mandatory so if i go to the ui here i can go to credentials to connect to my topic i need a token and to retrieve my topcon i can click to show token and now you can pause the video and steal my token i will delete my tenant anyway and it's a free tenant so to copy the token you do not want to select like that there is here a small icon hidden that you can click on and now there is just a notification telling that your authentication token is in the clipboard okay all right this is my authentication token and what i want to do is create a producer in java so pretty cool again there is a code sample over here and code samples are providing for java you're using maven the dependency how to code a producer how to code a consumer how to code a reader and you can simply check change the values here and it will change the code but here look at that your authentication token has already been provided for you and it's the real one so if you do have an id on your machine you can simply copy paste that code and do all the steps and it works if you are more into python because i saw a lot of python in the beginning with my question which are you which language are you using you can pip install the client and again copy paste the producer and now you do have a producer for this workshop i've already created a producer for you in java so i want you to run that producer but again i don't want you to install anything so go and click open in bitpod you know you can right click open in a new tab because if you just click on the button it will open in the same tab this is not what we want okay so gitpod is what we are using for every workshop when you need to code either java python node everything is working on gitpod and it will open a ide based on the code you do have in the github repo so you need a github account to start your workspace based on this value and it will open uh vs something very similar to vs code or eclipse cea so full working id in the cloud okay so um it may open like that let's close everybody and you can you should here have some pre-build items ready it's not the first time i open my workspace and this is why i'm already like that but you simply can now um compile so let's see so cd pulsar demo and you do here have the java project with simple pulsar consumer and simple pulsar producer so the code we show in the ui how to implement a producer i already copy that code and paste that code but because we will use consumer and producer instead of copy pasting the token i put a little bit of code here just some things reading all the all the values you need from property files and what i need you to do is wait to go to the property files and change the configuration to connect to cask so you need to change the token have to you need to change the tenant name using your tenant name and also now check if you use a different topic name that astra you can change that here if you did not pick us west 2 you simply have to change here and here but except from that you should be good to go i copy the code for the producer and externalize what we call externalize put all the configuration value in an external file so i open in gitpod this is what has been asked and click properties replace the token and also replace the tenant's name okay this is the file you do have here you can copy paste this file as a start and replace your token which is in your clipboard and change the name and it's in the clipboard because on credential you click here so let's see do we have question no i think jonathan is on top of all the questions thank you okay so you open git pod you compile you change the keys now what you want to do is run the producer and so the producer is really the the code i showed you before it's really a producer not a new producer so look at that i want to send json format in my in my topic so when i create a producer i simply tell i want json multiple formats are available json avro protobuf so about the pulsar client yeah pulsar client it's just really some single turn to connect to your pulsar instance so you need the service url and your authentication token and from this pulsar client you will create producer and consumer all right so now first command to execute is to be sure you are let me go to gitpod you are on the proper folder so see pwd i am on slash workspace slash workshop pulsar slash pulsar demo okay so ground command to execute is maven compile execute java so again you simply have to copy paste that command in git pod and cross finger this guy should compile the code connect and start sending message every second all right so pretty cool now we do have this guy sending message to kesk once every second so why one every second that's simply me that have put a tempo let's hey please wait for one second and why once ago yes first i want you to have time to read the message and second i want to be gentle with the free tier okay i don't want to deal with the free tier all right okay that's it now uh seems like it's running so if i go to the cask ui if i go to the topic i should see the storage increasing i should now also see that i do have a producer so let's see i'm going to topic oh see indeed i do now have a producer and the storage size is on the rise so 256.7 okay see i do not send a lot of massage per second see the the rate is less than one second less than one message per sem so this is me producing i already have a consumer running but you know you should simply have the producer one consumer zero subscription zero and if you go to details if you go to producer you can see now that this producer is running and see it has connected two minutes ago and it's sending 100 bytes per so it's going it's ongoing it's ongoing so if you are there congratulations you already have a java producer sending stuff into cask keep moving what we want to do also is so yes that goes that the settings of the topic what we want to notice is schema see we send an object using the producer so the object is called demobin in has two two attributes id and value okay and simply just asking uh pulsar that i need to send some json because when in the producer i ask for json now i can send an object and the object will be serialized at the json for me and the schema is generated on the fly and so you can tell you can ask pulsar to validate the schema and reject messages that do not validate this schema so json is a way to go we also often use avro and protobuf which are what we call serialized format the idea is to provide less amount of data because it's serialized and compressed so less data coming on the wired and the serialization person is very very fast so that's really mean to be as fast as possible json is cool because uh if we look inside the topic with a simple client we can see what's happening and speaking of which now what we want to do is to look at the message incoming from the ui so here i step 7 i provide you all the keys you need to enter to set up the web circuit take this client so if i go to my case dashboard test client so i do have test client one what i would like to do is really to produce and read message from the astra topic okay so it will use a subscription named tc1 i use the subscription type exclusive remember exclusive shared or key shared those are the three subscription type available so simply because i i said consume topic and produce topic astra if i click to con to to to connect yes now boom boom boom boom boom yes each time my java producer send message the web ui will show the message here so if i look at the log so yeah if i pick the message 60b1 and go to the ui 60b1 he's there it's already passed you know if i if i it's it's already there so so yeah pretty nice looking we do have something consuming the message what's about consuming the message from java now you got the id it's not that difficult what we want to do is go to step 8 now and it will be consume the message from java so what has been asked is going to the git board open a new terminal by clicking the icon over here see my producer is still there moving to the proper directory okay and now execute the code of the consumer which we use the same property files internet name authentication token and this is the main reason i externalize that you should do that as well when you create a real app and so cross finger now this guy should start reading the message as well okay so now i do have this guy sending and this guy receiving so if now i look at my dashboard cask if i go to the topic now i do have two consumers of course because i do have the web ui and i do have the java consumer so two consumers running and one producer the producer is the guy in java okay so that's running i now complete the labs number two and i can move to labs number three so how are you doing can you send me some thumb up in the youtube chat if you if you okay we actually use 30 minutes for this for this one uh we're wasting on time three and four should be uh pretty okay so you got the error maven compile yeah you sh okay so thank iron um yeah if so bob andres thing uh to copy paste the stack of the error you should really go to discount this is where you can have a more troubleshooting there is no way uh you get an error if you are in the proper folder so don't forget to do cd pulsar demo this command maven exact maven compile exact you really should do before cd just to be sure to be in the proper place where you do have the code because by default you are not in the proper folder yeah so more so hopefully we just race race race okay so but you know robert tell us if uh instructions are clear enough to do these uh end zone by your own okay so um moving on again um so you you know i have something sending message and something consuming message using cask what we want to do now is connect these pulsars as a service instantly in the cloud to cassandra i don't want you to install cassandra so i will move that let's move i will use astra okay astra provide cassandra as a service in the cloud and in the labs you will set up astra and connect cask to astra so if i go back a bit so pulsar john explained that jonathan explained that very well in the beginning already both are distributed a system that that have a lot of uh of concept in common so with the partitioning distribution a key distribution hashing replication dc and you can almost draw some kind of table all right so a node in cassandra is a bookie a topic could be a namespace could be a key space a topic is almost a table inside a topic you do have keys and ledger and inside the customize table you do have partition those are not exactly the same we just show that uh in a partition you do have multiple ledgers but again and then they are both uh only log they both provide ttl they both provide reaper compaction it's really when i when i start learning pulsar it was okay okay so that's the same i can't have the same i guess somehow that the same occasion and because they are designed in the same way they are working with the same use case which are i volume high throughput read and write from everywhere on the world uh availability uh and you know high performance okay so how to use cassandra and pulsar well you can first create some micro services and use pulsar as a communication broker between microservice and finally use cassandra to store all the data because even if pulsar use all the can save all the message in an app and log it's not very convenient to store very large amount of data you would rather dump these data in cassandra where you can do very large requests and use cql query language okay second pattern the one we are using is re-even streaming like you know iot click stream your localization tons of systems send you real-time events and so all the events are crushed into pulsar and in pulsar there is something called pulsar io connector two flavors of connector sources and sink sources capture events from something like sometimes you may have heard about cdc change data capture is the same behavior sync is okay now the data is in pulsar i want pulsar to move the data to a third party system it's called a thing and so you already guessed it but what we do have is we do have a dedicated sync for pulsar to send data into cassandra and astra okay so you might ask okay but in the data stacks ecosystem you also you already provide spark okay so moving uh data from one queue to another it's or moving data from cassandra to something else is something we are used to do with uh with spark well see spark streaming is high level languages and you will use spark for computation advanced transformation but you need a runtime for spark whereas as in pulsar okay transformations are way simpler because it's really simple mapping from something in the topic to something in cassandra but there is no need for extra runtime now this is the directly pulsar that will push that it's it should be push not pull push data to a casama okay so let's do labs number three with the astra labs number three is really you need a database so let's go create the database so what you will do in three and four so the left part of the screen is something you already have git pod sending and receiving message in the topic astra what we will do is what we have on the right side we'll create a astra instance we will create something to store the data which is a table okay then we will create the thing instantiate this thing for cask to to send that time to astra and we will show the result in astra and we will be done for the exercise so yes ancient group the pulsar topic json schema will be mapped to the cassandra table and we will set up how to do so it's key by key there is a dedicated value to an in labs this is exactly what you are doing okay so um go to astra okay i will just log out leave so i will log into astra with using my github account so this is also why it is pretty neat to have a github account you can go there and reuse the github account to connect to astra if you do not have a database astra will ask you to create this database it's very very fast to do so you sign in create your instance so i provide you so again use the free tier and re the the the free tier not serverless serverless is also free uh but you know the demo is mean to be used by the free tier let's keep using the fridge don't want to go too much into several less detail today we will have a serverless workshop in three weeks so more on that features soon but for today let's keep the free plan okay now change choose the region um if you are using the free tier the only region you can pick is google cloud and it it's only because it's a free tier and google cloud is the cheapest for us to run the demo uh and you know in a way you don't have to pay okay when you pick google cloud you can you do have two regions you can choose either u.s east or europe west and pick the one that has the closest to you just to reduce the latencies or you know what pick the one that has the closest to kesk because kesk is in u.s west 2. so i would rather pick us east one to reduce the latency between cask infrastructures and ask her infrastructures cloud to cloud yeah let's do multi-cloud will you we do have case on aws and we do have astra on gcp yeah multi-cloud baby and then you click configure database and the second screen to configure the database is provide database name provide the name as you wish again it's like the tenant name for cask really it's not part of the connection url you can pick whatever you like then key space so now the key space pulsar and i know it's i don't know if it's misleading to name the key space pulsar on the ass on the customer side and name the topic astra on the other side but single turn is pretty easy to remember so pick the key space pulsar but again just to have exactly the same settings as me but if you pick another key space name it will work as well you simply have to change the settings when it comes to mapping from casc to cassandra astra user restore password and create the database so it will show you these new block databases and for one minute it will be in pending mode this is asynchronous we are spawning a customer cluster for you and after one minute it will become active okay and when the database is active well this is what it looks like right so that my database is there and it's active so you can either click on the free tier or click connect and what i would like to show is now the summary so this is a free tier and you do have five gigabytes for free again you did not provide any credit card right and it will be free forever so i think that 2020 was pretty cool to have a pretty advanced workload available for free for you so it's active i do have one key space name pulsar i can add another key spaces i wish my region is us east 2 yes yes one i can see the user database name but i cannot see the user password it's secure it's encrypted so astra platform is certified on sock two certification now so you cannot store your we cannot store your password so all the only option we have is to ask you to reset your password if you forget about it but if you provide the keys i give you it should be astra password okay so the database is there but it's empty right so go to the cql console you don't have to provide any username of password in sql console and we will first say use or we can say describe describe key spaces just to list all the key spaces available so there are a bunch of system key spaces and there is the guy we just created pulsar so you can say use pulsar and then in this key space you need you will create a table okay so the table is named product here and it's like id and description the table already exists so i can simply describe that table for you describe table products so as you can see i do have a table named products with two colon id and descriptions okay and remember in my pulsar i do have an object with two feeds id and value and now if i look in cask and see and i see uh let's say consumer astra and i've seen the json message what's that are in there oh no disconnect see i put the wrong topic name so it's empty so see now i do have id and value id and value id and value so now what we want to do is tell kesk okay this message with ido and value i want you to map that into astra and colon is id and description it's not exactly the same name so let's see how we set up the mapping to make that work and by the way uh yes i'm cheating uh you know what i will truncate my table uh products just to empty that table okay so do root and you can select and your table is empty because as of today nothing in there and this is what it should look like so now to connect to astral there are multiple ways rest api document api graphql api if you go to connect you see all the ways to connect to astronauts so as what is good with astra is not only you do have cassandra for free you can use any of the drivers available for for cassandra c-sharp cpu java python node but also there is an abstraction layer on top of it providing api with graphql and document now pulsar is a java application java is pulsar is written in java and so when we implement a pulsar sync we also using java so how to connect a java pulsar app to cast on our app still using java yes anyway i'm a java nerd jonathan is a java guru so let's use java and so to connect to astra using the driver with java you need a zip file which is called the secure cloud bundle so i went to connect java download the secure cloud bundle i will click on download bundle and then i will connect my vendor okay so which is neat is the name of the bundle is really secure connect bundle dash the name of your database okay so you save that locally on your laptop okay now if the moment of trash you do have set up your astra database now the lab number four and no transition we will set up kesk to connect to astra so let's go again it's step by step and if i'm going too fast especially because the object is already created on my cluster well you can go back and do it on your own pace and provide feedback for us on the discord once the youtube chat is closed all right so moving on uh so i will go now to cask let's well this guy is connected let's clear it's keep coming okay it's working all right happy with that i will go to sync and i will go to manage because i already have my sync setup and running but i will show you the keys to render to make that happen okay so uh overview so to connect and to create a sync for uh pulsar what you need to provide is first the the type of the sync so there are multiple things available you should pick customer enhance sync enhance mean you can do advanced mapping between topic in values in topic and customer tables okay so once you have picked the proper maybe i can go to sync and try to add one so let's see is it happy with that so let's see sync manage add and i can add a new thing and so by default is iron spike let's see i want to use customer enhance and see how many technologies are available with pizza like that okay and in case you don't have to to to import the the libraries and the connector it's all there for you so pick customer and ends provide your cloud secure bundle okay the one we just downloaded use astra user astra password one okay provide astra true verb as the name of the topic astra they are both true to have the log and okay then i will click for extra settings and this is where the magic happens one key is really the encoding from mapping from pulsar to customer and i provided you this key so i use user password so the key is topic okay dot name of the topic okay dot cassandra key space so here it's pulsar dot cassandra table name dot mapping okay so now we know that we will map the topic astra to this table from okay from this topic to this table and this is a mapping okay and the value is colon name in cassandra equals value because we are working with the content of the message and not the either but we can map also keys from the either and because the format is json really it's simple as that simply say value dot id so the id property in the json message should go into id column in the customer table value.value so the value attribute inside the message should be mapped to the description column in customer and so as information i provided you how it works and how to create your own mapping if you pick some keys that are different so add key add key and um so then number 11 disable auto ack just a check box to disable and 12 provide the name of the topic astra add the topic and the topic should go there and so what i and finally when if you do have everything you click add and this is when you click add that the thing will be created so here i provide you a last screenshot for you to show okay you provided astra through the two keys we just created uh disable auto act providing astra don't change the names maze i topic the astra topic is there and click i but i cannot click add again because in my last screenshot the sync were created okay as soon as you click you can go to it will show up this telling you that the sync is creating and initializing if the instance uh is one and running is keep zero that means the settings is not correct and if the setting is not correct you can go to the tab logs to see if what you did wrong and to change that so if i go to this topic and i go to logs see now i do have some logs each time i do have a new message coming because now my my sync is an instance that is running so now like that if i go to the log and i should see new message coming um and i clear and get get older message and each time i see new see there is an hour delay between cask and me we we are not working at the same time zone and so you get this message telling you that you receive something you will think something you receive something so topic instance and so look at that i do have 3377 message sent and read from pulsar so miss incoming message and that outgoing message so it's running so if i go to astra and go to my table so again oh it's connection closed so it can happen that means you reach the timeout in the secret console it's secure you know you remember we are certified sock too so if you leave a terminal open that's not a pretty good measure for a security reason so again i will use pulsar key space and you know what i will truncate my table product so empty and now i will start select values in the product okay so now i do have seven rows and if i wait now i do have ten now i do have twelve and now this is the haha moment when you say holy now my message is coming into customer and it's just clicking in the web browser and i do have some producer in java sending data into a pulsar online cloud-based instance also pushing the data into a cloud-based customer instance and it's all for free and it will stay free so pretty cool okay so how are we doing in the chat uh eureka if you use github it was pretty uh quick and easy yes cool yeah i hope i've provided enough information in the in the in the wiki to make that easy and obvious but you know if you have some issues again the uh the discord chat is there to help and we are still there up to the end of this stream to answer your question as well in the youtube chat all right uh so yeah and this is a haha moment where you finally do the full from the producer to to astra so congratulations if you manage to do that during the workshop live so let's now do some closing sharing a bunch of resources and play the game so move to resources okay maybe resources here is good enough so everything is free today so even the slides so the slides we used are there so simply go there and you do have the pdf so that's me pretty look like the picture i guess if you like the content uh consider to subscribe to the youtube channel you know that make us growing and growing um if you like this workshop we do have tatastax.com workshops and all the incoming workshops are there if you want to register and if you do not want to go to this page each time there is here a mailing list so it's opt-in okay no marketing stuff remember that hashtags dev devmint developer okay and we are doing architectures not marketing architectures okay real stuff you know as you wish uh to access the gist pod bitly that cassandra workshop and the name of the glitch it's it's pretty cool it's fellowship of the rings okay and we we are about 9 000 people there and if you like the content i give you a small button tweet share share on the platform okay that's it for keep in touch with us when it comes to keep learning so uh datastax is well known to provide learning support for you to progress with cassandra but not only we do a lot of content around docker kubernetes because it's really the future of cassandra by itself and of course some pulsar now so you can use data stacks dev with a lot of pages per topic catacombs are statistics with a lot of exercise per topic if you like me like to the end zone this is the way you go and if you more like you know online learning watching video uh person you can go to academy.com and then we do have full-fledged courses uh we also have some community.alastar.com which is stack overflow for cassandra you know i i feel this is a lot of links but because it's there it's easy for you to go there bookmark click and you know share share the love okay so that was for the sharing resource and i do have some slides over in streaming we did that extra resources and game so resources to share guess what this is exactly what we did no need to go back and forth uh we had the question in the youtube chat and we do not answer on purpose what is the big difference between kafka and pulsar because those two solutions are both top-level apache project and those are both distributed messaging solution so ninety percent of those two solution is total overlapping and you know what data stacks also provide a thing for kafka you know we use this thing for pizza we also have this thing for kafka so what's really the difference above among the two and is there any steps that make pulsar a little bit better in some case and the other way around well our superstar from pilsa so jonathan and chris which is product manager of pulsar will be there in two weeks to form a webinar to show that deep dive this is a link and you do have the link in the slides and you here have the qr code to register i saw a frank before the beginning of the monet thank you to be with us each week it's cool thank you asking for this webinar in the beginning so here it is take a screenshot uh and register to this one okay uh we also have the uh a survey okay take the survey to win prize the new global developer economic survey is not open so uh you know as usual we love your feedback and so we do a feedback with mentimeter because we're asking you question live and in the end survey but broader survey it's better we really want to know you guys you know you really want to know guys who which languages are you using which use case do you need we really need to adapt the content we create for you i don't know you might tell but producing these wiki it's a long time to do so if we can spot on exactly the topic we expect yeah so please uh fill the survey and look at that every developer who completes the survey will get a free virtual goodie back um see you know virtual goodie bag okay at that tax we do better let's win some real swag in a couple of minutes okay live coding on youtube this is a youtube channel again if you like the format the interactivity the topics consider to subscribe to the channel this is what uh help us grow yeah like all the youtube stuff thumb up leave a comment okay developer resources you know these links are provided in the other github so we'll go fast on that me to thank you and with the last minutes in in in the moment are feeling really the thank for you today with me which is a super good job not only presenting in the beginning all the pool star stuff but also answering all the questions and discord on youtube that's sweet thanks cedric thanks everyone okay which technology cassandra okay count on us custom height kubernetes you will be covered we have you covered 100 serverless okay that's also coming uh kafka we have some content on the channel regarding kafka okay yes this is the first workshop on pulsar more to come and it was also the first time i run the new content so if i add some glitch and typo in the slides we will fix that in in soon game dev see what that's pretty neat that serverless and game dev are side by side so um what we call build a serverless game in two weeks we will using react and redux build the javascript game in serverless using cassandra seems like you do not want to miss this session so pulsar kasama yeah all about katakurda we all love katakura and you know next time we will be ready and bring even more resource on the katakuda to make all of you succeed with the exercises and with that i think we are at the top of the hour so i will simply thank you all for coming and see you next week and again thank you jonathan for coming see you all bye and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of cassandra he grew those powers until she could multiply it will move with limitless speed and unmask hidden knowledge with those powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous feats",
