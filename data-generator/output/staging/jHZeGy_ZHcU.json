    "text": "hello and welcome to this video on designing test workloads with nosql bench my name is david joy and i'm a data architect with data stacks in this video we're not going to talk about nosql bench setup but we're specifically going to focus on how to design the test workloads so let's start with level ones that is the essentials of nosql bench so if you've already used nosql bench or have set it up there are key things that you need to know one is uh data gets generated through this capability called virtual data set so nosql bench actually uses that capability which is embedded in it to generate data on the fly and it's all of that everything that we execute with no sql bench is basically through command line we will have to understand this fundamental idea of cycles a cycle is basically every statement that gets executed there are various types of drivers available there is the standard out driver which allows you to just output the statements that you're generating versus the sql driver that allows you to run these statements on you know cassandra through the sequel driver and then we have all this matrix that gets generated from nosql bench that goes into you know prometheus and grifana and the most important thing that we need to do is make sure that we understand bindings when we generate uh our workloads because these bindings really generate the data that we want to you know specifically generate so if you have installed nosql bench you know you can just go do dot slash nb hyphen iphone list drivers and it should give you a list of drivers that are available with nosql bench you can also do dot nb help and just specifically put the driver that you want to see and get instructions around it through that so when you typically run a workload this is how you will have to write your uh you know command line so you'll have to do dot slash nb you will have to put start or run and then put driver the kind of driver that you're using put the workload and the workload should be equal to a specific yaml file that you generate that has all the workload specifications and then you will tell how many such statements do you want to run so how many cycles you really want to run you want to run it 10 times you want to run it you know 50 times 100 a million like that it can go on so in these two statements that you see here we are using driver equal to sql so it's basically going to run this uh on cassandra where the stdr driver in this statement is going to just generate the output so and it's used specifically for you know testing purposes uh to test if you're generating the right sort of data all right so let's talk about designing workload so any workload that it is any nosql bench name will be a yaml file and a gamma file should have blocks statements tags bindings and parameters now we'll go deeper into these fundamental ideas but the main thing that you need to understand is a block is basically basically an overarching container that runs different statements each statement is basically what kind of an activity you want to run what you want to generate and a tag is a typical name that is associated with a statement and binding as we were speaking previously is the function that actually generates the data and there are parameters that you want to associate with different statements like ratios or you know consistency levels that you can define uh using parameters and there are there is also capability to do multi multi docks all right so here's an example of a testy apple that we're going to run the name of the dock is dock one there are two blocks the block one and block two each one of them has different statements so but if you notice here i have statements uh with the same name s1 s1 in both of them but they are understood uh to be part of different blocks so there will not be an issue we have bindings defined call alpha and beta and the alpha here will generate uniform from 1 to 50 any number beta will generate numbers from 51 to 100. these are just functions that we are calling in our statements and again they should generate that number again you have another alpha binding that is defined here but if you can see here the binding is a combination so it will generate a combination string so if you notice here the thing is you can have one binding written for all the statements of your block you can also have that for the overall document you can generate a binding like that you can also write bindings very specifically for a particular statement and so that ways you have all the flexibility that you need so let's just go back and just run the statement i'm gonna run and generate you know uh 10 cycles off and i'm using the std out drivers to generate and see how this data looks like so again we saw block one block two generated a combination we see uh block one statement two generated a different number again that ways you can see that the data is getting generated if we do the same thing again because nosql bench is deterministic it should generate the same data actually so if you see here even when i ran it for the second time it actually generated the same data so that is one advantage that we have with nosql bench so let's go back to this yaml again and now we are defining you know parameter so what we are doing here is we have two blocks block one and block two i want to generate more of block two data so ratio of eight and the ratio of 2 for block 1. so let's just do this and this way you will see that block 2 data will be generated more because of the way we have designed and defined the parameter you should see data so again as you see block 2 got generated more right so that's that's the advantage that we have here we can define things the way we want it change your cycles and get the data all right so let's talk about level two and this one will specifically focus on using the sql driver so main thing that you need to understand is that each of these uh statements that you use with the sql driver need a specific phase and there are multiple phases we have a space for generating the schema for creating the schema basically that phase is called schema and then we have a ramp phase the ramp up phase basically creates your data and it's mostly insert so if you want to just to write you want to use phase equal to ramp up and a main phase is basically where you generate a mixed read and write pattern where you want to have you know 50 read and at the same time 50 rights going on so very similar to what kind of your production workload should look like so that phase would be called main so you want to split uh your yaml file and different with different phases and so let's have a look at how uh level two uh you know yaml would look like and how we can design it all right so we have this nosql bench level to yammer let's go into that again what you would notice is we have one doc two blocks block called schema and a block called ramp up the schema block has a tag with a face called schema defined which is for generating the statements for creating key space and creating table we have a ramp up block with the phase equal to ramp up and that is mostly for inserts and what you would notice here is we are doing insert into this table uh key and a value and it identifies two bindings row key and row value again there are two significant things that you want to notice here we have defined row key one at a block level and we have binding at a statement level uh for row value it will generate some random names actually and insert two has the same thing happening but if you notice a row key here is defined specifically for insert two and it will generate only numbers from 1 to 50 whereas row value will generate first names for that particular statement so we are again making it flexible you can define things at a block level uh and that runs for or that runs all the bindings for all the statements at the block level or it can be specific to a statement so let's go and run a few statements what we will do here is we are going to basically run and see how the output looks like so we'll run the schema phase and see what it's getting generated uh through nosql bench and see if you can notice as it will generate statements that we defined earlier so create key space and create table and now let's see what an insert statement would do so we will have to do ramp up and we'll have to associate that with a certain set of cycles that we want to run and again we're running 100 cycles so it's going to generate different insert statements that will go to sql and that's what is happening if you see notice here different numbers are getting generated again if you notice it there are some points where the number is actually less than 50 that's because of the specific binding that we defined uh for insert two all right so now that we have focused on you know how to write a yaml file with sql driver and how it actually works let's focus on running the main workload and the key idea about the main workload is that the main workload should be similar to what your actual test phase is or should try to emulate your production environment so what we need to do here is you know have the right ratios decided and have the right parameters defined for your your main workload again the key thing to know is like if you're running the main workload you want to start it you want to define the driver you want to tell what workload you're running um it's just nosql level 3 that we'll run we're telling that we want to run the main phase so we'll put tags equal to main uh phase equal to main we'll do cycles equal to 100k that's what we want to run and we're doing threads equal to auto basically use as many threads uh that we have available and then we're defining the set of hosts where our nodes basically in my cassandra cluster or my data center and i'm basically reporting that to go uh to my prometheus or grafana so that's what we will be doing in the next uh example and let's have a look at that all right so we have this third amble that i've written here that's specifically to focus on the main phase and we're calling it your nosql bench level 3ml so let's just go into it basically the first part is the same that we saw in our previous example in the previous code and now we'll come to this block actually and what you can see here is we have two blocks block name main read another block name main right both of them have the same phase actually the phase defined is uh you know main again the type is read for this particular block and the other one is right we are writing parameters again the ratio of two basically we are going to run two statements from this read block while we run eight statements from this block so we defined the uh you know the ratio and this is typically to emulate the production environment so you may have you know six rights happening uh to four reads and basically that's the ratio so if you have like one million uh transaction happening they will actually distribute in the ratio that you define so we're basically doing select or read and select statement and while we're continuing to insert so let's go back and look at how this will look like and again for the purposes of this video i'm using the standard out driver to show you how data will get generated from nosql bench and how it will hit your cassandra cluster however you would want to use the sequel driver uh and make sure uh that you use the same kind of statement that had shown in the pdf so let's just run this and see how this looks main face let's run 100 statements again yesterday out and let's see how that looks so this should generate data so if you see we are having a read we're having another read but we're having more inserts going on so that's what is essentially the overall objective of the test now the key thing if you've noticed here is that you can define the way you want to do your design of the ammo file but the meat of the bones is basically in the binding right the way you define your bindings and bindings can be complex so i want to give you a few examples that i have used in the past that you can look at that you can use to create your uh you know production like workload so we'll have a look at that a more advanced binding uh video and then um you know i'll let you experience no sql bench's awesomeness all right so the key to having a good load test is to have a good test with good quality data getting generated now this data needs to emulate the kind of data that your application is getting generated and that gets loaded into cassandra so the key to doing that is through making sure that you're using the right bindings on top of your workload so bindings basically help you generate the data and it's using the uh you know virtual data set capabilities uh to generate all these so there are various bindings available if you come to the documentation there are lots of uh documentation available around you know date functions uh general functions and you know state functions collections lots of values and lots of functions available but in this video i'm going to give you like some basic uh high level uh you know bindings that you can use to generate realistic data similar to what you may have in production all right so let's just go into the bindings.yaml file and have a look at some bindings that can be used for creating production level data so here what we have is different bindings available and i'm going to output these out and we'll see how they get generated and how this data looks so let's start with partition id and typically what you would see is you want to create a partition in cassandra so you want to have repeated patterns right you want to have you know 100 partitions 200 partitions you know 300 partitions so you want to repeat uh the same set of users or transaction ids or uuids so what we can do here is we have partition id and i'm using something called mod that will allow that repeated pattern so we are saying mod of five and then hash whatever is getting generated and converted into a string and then we have a separate id that i'm getting i'm generating through this function called weighted strings and in that i'm saying the string that i want to uh generate for that id is david and the ratio is one all right and so now we have s1 and we're generating only partition id and id so let's have a look at how this works and what you would notice is that mod will generate a similar set of patterns so we wanted to generate five five specific uh you know partition id so if you see one two three four and five and then the same pattern gets repeated so basically this way we are generating uh different partitions and now we have the same id because the weighted string that we defined was one so the ratio was repeat the same thing again and again we can go and change this up a little bit more by adding something called weighted string and breaking up that ratio so we can break the ratio up now we are saying i want to generate new year 0.5 uh that is 0.25 and houston 0.25 this basically breaking the weighted strings uh ratio up location and let's have a look at this we'll run this again and this time you would see different pattern getting generated uh for the partition and based on the ratio that we defined so as you see new york was supposed to be higher because we said half of it should be in new york so right so let's go back and now we want to generate another set of transaction id and again what we're doing here is like generating an identity and that's basically any number and then hashing it and adding that to string before i run the next one i want to talk about time bucket or now bucketing is a very important feature and kind of something that comes up a lot during cassandra discussions because you want to break your partition sometimes and you don't want to have white partitions so what we are doing to really what we want is we want to generate in this particular example i am creating bucketing based on year actually but before we get to that we want to get through some steps so what we are doing here is we're using a weighted string and we are generating different uh time stamps and these actually associate with different time stamps we are converting this string now uh into you know a long and then adding a hash range a hashtag is basically a specific time window that we are adding to this bucket and then we are saving this as a specific time called tx time using save long and then we are converting this by uh adding a string date wrapper into just the ear format and saving that as a long in the output but what you would see in the next part is date modified is basically calling this text time uh that is getting generated so if here we were able to save a timestamp that timestamp is getting saved and that's what we are loading into our next function and then we are converting that into two date and that what that is what will get generated so if you notice in our outputs um you know time bucket in the form of year that's what is happening and then we have you know the modified date getting generated so if you noticed here we had a date in this format and we extracted only the year out of it and that is becoming a part of our window so that's another way to generate data generate timestamp all right so let's go back in you may also want to do a scenario where you want to create you know a pattern of names so you can use a combination function or you could also use you know a function or a generated template so you could generate something like template add to uh you know curly brackets here and basically pull in the various functions that you want to call in that you can call any function in it so you can actually have um you know a last name along with a first name along with actually uh let's say identity and as you can see what we did was we kind of created a combination of words that run together and you know generate data together so we have first name getting generated along with that we we had last name but we changed it to identity so it's generating identity function that gets generated in a sequence starting from one all right so let's go back again and now this is something that is very important uh so i have come across situations where you would have you know 100 or 200 words that you want to get generated in a random way so what you could do is just create a text file and we'll see that text file but call the text file in the form hash line to string and this will basically randomly take one input from the text file and generate that data so here if you can notice what you have we have is it label is a set of is basically a set or a you know a list so what i'm doing here is i'm saying i want a hash range a hash range between three and five so i want to create different sets and each of these sets should have different last names so you can remove the function that you want in it to an identity or a different function like a weighted string or a combination or a mod whatever you generate but the key is that you want to use set and make sure that it's part of the set and balance is basically we're generating a random number between zero and you know in this case actually hundred thousand and converting that to too long uh so that it's basically in the bigger number so let's call these three functions and see how the output looks and again it's simple the goal is to generate data that is realistic so get to know your pattern so if you see here what is happening is it's generating randomly in this particular column you know different numbers and i will show you what the text file looks like because this is data getting pulled in from a different text file and again we are generating a set and if you noticed here the size of the set is varying because we said we want the set range to be between you know three and ten so it will change according to that but it will generate different names which is what we want the set to have based on the set range that we've put our hash range and again we are converting into too long but the last function was generating you know a balance basically balance amount so this is what you can typically do again i wanted to talk to you about that file so let's have a look at the data.txt file and if you come here you know i'm just creating different patterns let's just go in again and just say i want i want b ones i want b twos b threes or b fours and just save it and every time we'll run it uh run the workload it'll generate different numbers uh from that file so let's just change this let's just make this you know 15 and see what's happening so this time what you would notice is we will have five partitions each of them will have think about it like three records because the same partition gets repeated so same partition same partitions a set of partitions and same set of partitions but if you notice now is that we have you know other data getting generated generated in the form of you know b4 because we just added that capability in in that data.txt file so the key thing is you have the flexibility uh here i use the std out driver just to showcase the fact that you can uh get the data generated in this form but make sure that you are using the sql driver and you can create the schema um in the schema phase add create key space create table add your custom index or the sai index that you want to create and then basically it's all about the bindings so hope this was useful uh and you know looking forward to any other questions that you may have but the goal was to you know get you started again please feel free to reach out to us we're here to help you out thank you so much have a nice day",
