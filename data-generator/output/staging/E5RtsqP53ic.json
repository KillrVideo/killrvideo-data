    "text": "well welcome to uh week two of our summer series uh for app development um this week is building a tick tock clone um which is going to be a lot of fun i think um i'm uh my name is ryan welford i'm joined by kirsten hunter hello kirsten how are you great to see you all or virtually see you yeah but it's not just us too we have let me make a smaller we have a whole team of people uh on the developer advocates team um and many of them are in the chat ready to uh answer your questions so uh please feel free to ask questions in the youtube chat as well as on discord and i'll get to the discord if you haven't heard about our discord as well but yeah feel free to ask questions we have a team of people who are ready for the for the questions and ready to answer them um so previously in this series this is week two last week we went over the very basics of creating your first app we talked about using the create react app tool to get a kind of boilerplate app up and running really quickly and we talked about the back end the node.js infrastructure and also connecting a database to your app with using rest apis and using our astra db now i have a quick uh housekeeping things to do real quick um uh just to go over some of the tools that we'll be using uh so youtube and twitch that is where we are uh streaming uh we are not very active on the twitch chat so if you are watching on twitch want to come over to the youtube chat uh if you want to ask questions we also have a discord though if you want to join our discord it is a growing community of i think close to 14 000 people now um and you can also ask questions in there we monitor that chat as well and discord is a great place to continue asking questions because once the workshop is over we can't see the youtube chat and we can't answer your questions so if you want to join our discord community it's a great place to have your questions answered and continue developing that relationship and developing that community mentee.com is a app that we're going to be using as a website uh where we will be doing some quizzes some ask you guys some questions at the end we'll have a game where you can win some prizes some swag but we'll also have a few questions here at the beginning um that i would like to ask but before that we can talk about um the tools that we'll be using we're going to be using github all of our workshops are on github the repos are self-service and they will all the instructions are there and and you'll be able to follow along very closely there for our ide we're going to be using git pod which is a cloud ide it integrates very well with github and you can open the code directly in your browser nothing to install makes it very very easy kind of spins up a custom environment for you that has all the dependencies already there um we are going to be using astrodb for our database um and some of you who were here last week will already have an account which is great we will go through that process uh very quickly again for those of you who were not here last week but it is a cassandra apache cassandra based uh database in the cloud fully managed serverless and it has um a api layer called stargate that allows us to communicate with rest apis document apis and graphql and then finally netlify is going to be our deploy and hosting solution today it is a global cdn that allows us to host our app um globally and give us some really cool functionality with serverless functions tanvi asks uh have i uh hey i've submitted my homework but it's not checked it yes we have had a lot of homework come through in the last week we have been doing our very best to keep up with it um but we there are still a few stragglers so we're not we will get to it in fact uh i'm sure we'll have someone grading it later today if not in the next few minutes if someone's available but yes we will get to the homework and for those of you who are uh new uh to our workshops here uh you might be like what's this homework that i hear about uh so we offer um badges to uh to those who complete the homework for our workshops these are badges that you can use on your linkedin profiles or your other social media or anything like that it's just a cool way to show that you are continuing learning but we will talk about that a little bit later this week we are making a tick tock phone so we have a mission for you uh your mission is to deploy a tick tock clone to production over a global cdn using one of the most robust and scalable nosql databases on the planet and we have a little less than two hours so uh good luck um hopefully you know for those of you who were here last week you have everything you need um and we'll we'll see you in about an hour and a half to see how you're doing uh you know what's really i i i serverless is such a cool thing like is this gonna be serverless before anyone starts panicking i'm joking we will walk you through how to do it uh yeah i forgot the gift okay bye uh yeah no we're not we're not gonna leave you on hanging like that we will walk you through everything that you need to do yeah uh sinister you've been to this workshop before yeah we do every workshop uh it's a joke we just wanna throw people for a loop we have a lot of new people so they haven't heard the joke all right so let's get into it um all right sorry first step is we are going to talk about our database connection right so we have this tick tock app and we're going to want to store some information we're going to store links to videos we're going to store titles descriptions all that kind of stuff so we need a database right we're going to be using astradb and like i said this is a apache cassandra based database uh fully managed in the cloud um and we have kind of this here this is kind of our database stack right we have our user interface right our web app that we're going to be developing uh we have our database at the bottom and then in between there we have this uh api layer that we call stargate and this allows us to communicate with the database using several different apis we have a rest api a graphql api and this week we'll be using the document api and this is how we're going to communicate with our database so we uh we have our repository on github we're going to be creating a astra database and we'll walk you through how to do that um it is completely free um so those of you who were not here last week we created some astro accounts last week it is completely free you can ask them no credit card is required to sign up uh you get 25 dollars of credit uh every month to use towards whatever you want i mean you can do commercial production level stuff it's like 40 million reads and what was it five million rights five million rights terabytes and uh storage uh 40 gigabytes of storage is it 40 i heard it was terabytes at this point but they might they might be wrong but it's it's a it's it's beefy like you could run a company um you know web application um uh for that for that money and it is it's a it's a serious um it's um we used to give you a free tier that was sort of uh more constrained um and you get lots more now yeah joy deep monthly yes every single month you get 25 credit so uh you like it'll refresh every single month uh and then you you varage can i use it for commercial purposes absolutely yes you can use it for whatever you want um i like myself we i have a astro account obviously to do all these workshops i don't have a special account that has unlimited whatever it's the exact same one that you guys are signing up for and i have never even gotten close to uh using up that uh 25 every month all right so with that this is kind of our setup we're gonna start with uh the database creation and get that all up and running um and for that i'm going to hand it over to kirsten who will walk us through that process um and it'll be super easy so kirsten it is awesome all right uh do you have my screen you do okay um so uh what we're gonna do is we're gonna deploy a tick tock clone somebody asked if we were gonna make a full tick tock uh clone and and no i mean it you know you can upload things you can see the you can follow and unfollow um most of the basic functionality of tick tock we're going to learn how to use the astra.js document api to quickly and easily interact with json documents you might think that seems kind of strange if you're familiar with cassandra already you're like but a document database doesn't have a schema and cassandra requires a schema but because of the magic of stargate one of the things it does is it sort of translates um you know those json documents into something that cassandra can store and it does a lot of the heavy lifting to uh do those searches on um the the contents of your json documents and then um we're gonna use um the data stacks astrodb as ryan said um if you already have an account um it's a little easier you can kind of skip one of the things um and then we're gonna use netlify one of the things that's and so netlify is a cdn and that's you know great i mean you've probably heard like akamai and um a lot of other cdns out there but one of one of the things that's um that's magic about netlify is that it allows you to create create serverless functions these are basically like aws lambda um functions but that means that your whole app can just run in the cloud right you don't have to um you don't have to host it somewhere that netlify will do that for you and it'll handle making those calls you can work run the workshop on your computer however um you need to have node 15 and npm 7 or later or it won't work correctly um and we're not going to cover the things you need to do if to run the workshop on your computer if you're interested in running the workshop on your computer you might just watch the workshop and then um at a later time you know when when it's convenient for you um uh you know you can you can uh set it up and you could always ask us in discord uh if you have questions so um we're gonna need a github account hopefully most of you have one or you can get one set up um we're going to go ahead and uh use a netify account and an astra db account but if you don't have those we'll just you know give you uh the information to do that and um this um the git pod that we're gonna use which is an in browser ide um does not gracefully work on safari so um i am using chrome as you can see um but uh firefox tends to work as well um uh you will you may have to install a plug-in but um it it's very quick it's it's uh it's and it's it's a great system git pod is so nice because it means you don't have to do you don't have to change your node version on your computer you don't have to install node or npm and um and it's just set up to work correctly so um there's some links here um to uh the slide deck the discord chat and questions and answers um and then the homework so these this is we'll we'll we'll bring this up again when we get done um and and uh you know point you back here but basically this is if once you have done these things and you send it in to us and uh we see that you have successfully done it then um then you'll get that badge and you can put it on your link link linkedin profile or your website wherever you want to put it so uh let's just get started um so the first thing you're going to need is to create an astra db now i will tell you that um if you already have an astra account you could technically skip this step because we're going to check to make sure you have the database a little bit later but if you need to register after you register it's going to ask you to create a database now you're going want your database name to be tick-tock workshop db and you're gonna want key space key space uh to be tick-tock underscore key space so um there's a little show me here that that you know it it it just walks through the process of um of creating a database in astra but again if you have if you haven't got a uh astra database already um then it'll ask you to create it at the at the outset so let me um let me check questions and stuff i think we need to take a couple few minutes for people to get this um this piece done yeah just real quick so um i've posted it into the chat a little bit but i'll post it again so um the github repo that we're working that kirsten is working through right now is publicly available so the link is is in the in um the chat uh if you click on that create astrodb link that's going to bring you to the astra website where you're going to create an account you can use uh you can use your github account you can use google account you can create your own account with your own email and whatnot um and it's a free account and it will prompt you to create a database right away um and again you can select the pay as you go option and it will give you 25 credit every single month it is the free option it's i think they might have changed the wording recently to start free or something like that which is little let me um let me let me uh see what we got all right yeah um i already have an account sign me in so i'll just go through this really quickly just to make sure that you all um can see what happens so because i already had a login it didn't ask me to create a new database so if the current plan is still called pay as you go which is confusing and we are trying we're just kind of struggling to figure out how to make it more clear that it's like astro base or astra core or something um uh you don't pay um when you register for astra it's not going to ask you for a credit card um it's not going to ask you for a credit card until you've used up 80 of your 25 in a month and then it'll give you the option to put in a credit card you don't have to put in the credit card and it'll just stop working until the end of the month when you get 25 more so um you'll never be surprised by being charged um so uh you know a lot of people are reasonably concerned because uh i know i uh ran up 30 000 on aws in the past so um that's not gonna happen here you're safe so um here on the database um so we're going to create a database and you know what i'm going to tab and put this here and get back to the github repo so we can see um what no yes keep going all right maybe that create asterisk db should make a new tab i don't know um we can't do that in github markdown it's so annoying we can't make new tabs just fabulous all right so uh tick tock workshop db and then tick tock key space right um so you might wonder what a key space is um it's just a place to organize your tables so it's kind of at the same level as other systems have databases but our database is actually a collection of key spaces and each key space is a collection of tables so um i'm going to choose uh oregon because i am on the west coast now again it does say it's a free tier up to 25 dollars a month and pay as you go this is this this information about the cost it's just informational for you like each of the um of the providers um has a slightly different charging mechanism so you might you might use that to help you decide which back end you want to use so i told it to create me a database now you'll see that i have a lot of databases and you see i actually have multiple tick-tock workshop ids but only one of them is pending that's the one i just created if that's going to be the case for a little while um and we'll come back and um take a look at the database when it's ready so um now we're going to deploy to netlify this button is really magical so what's going on real quick real quick we should uh let's wait until um we have confirmation that people have followed so far uh so if you if you have successfully created the database and are waiting for it uh where it says pending uh why don't you give us a thumbs up in the chat so we know that everyone has caught up if you have any questions or any uh issues that you're facing please let us know and we can work through it poke go the screen is not clear we are streaming in hd so make sure that you have selected the correct uh quality setting um and you you know maybe your connection is just being a little slow right now uh but we are streaming in hd all right lots of thumbs up everybody's doing great awesome okay so um let's go back to the repository so um i i suggest that you do what i've done here so you have uh one tab for uh astra one tab for the um the repository and then we're gonna deploy to natlify and i don't know if that makes a new tab let's just see well um actually i have a few slides that i want to go over before we do the notification okay that sounds great if you would sorry sorry kirsten i'm gonna i'm gonna stop you for a second no okay so before we get into the netflix while we're waiting for astra to do its thing um i want to talk about jam stack now jamstack is kind of a more recent um way of doing things and that's what we're going to be using um today now jam stack is a it stands for javascript uh apis and markdown um and there's a little graphic here so we have javascript apis mark markdown uh which are sent then to a static page generator and then distributed via a content delivery network now in our case we're going to be using netlify as our content delivery network and it's also going to or cdn and it's also going to provide us the ability to use serverless functions which means that we don't actually have to worry about our backend infrastructure at all that's going to be facilitated by netlify and all we have to do is basically create those apis that we're going to then call um through netlify and and get the information that we need and we'll go through how those serverless functions work but we just wanted to give a kind of primer on jam stack now i have this link that you see on the screen i'll post it in the chat as well we're not going to go through this but if you want to learn more about uh jam stack specifically we have a um a previous workshop that we did we kind of went more in depth on jam sec and this is that um that content there so uh if you want to learn more about jam sec and kind of the philosophy behind it you can go check that out um but with that we're going to talk about netlify like i said netlify is our global cdn um it's going to provide our serverless backend um this is kind of the architecture that we have that we have going right so this is a web application architecture we went over this last week we have our client uh which is mobile browsers web browsers um as well as progressive applications right you know applications that are kind of wrapped web views um running as applications and then we have our web server that's serving up um our content and that is talking to our database which is storing all of our information um and we're going to be using git pod to develop that middle section right uh that that content the front end um as well as the the back end apis and this is actually where netify comes in uh nepal is going to be that host um as well as the backend infrastructure for us so netlify lets us do a few things it actually integrates directly with github it allows for continuous development continuous integration or ci cd where we can host our uh our code on github and netlify can connect to that to that repo and anytime that we push our code to say our master branch right we've gone through all the tests and stuff and we've validated that it all works and we push it to master network will automatically pull that code build it and push it live um which is really really cool it's pretty fast it is it is actually really fast and you can actually see it doing everything you can watch the build process which is really cool it also allows us to take an existing repo such as our tick tock clone that we have on our data stacks devs repo and create a new site from that repo cloning the repo to your own account which is cool and that's how we're going to use it in this case at the beginning when you when you create site from netify using the link that's in the repo that you're viewing right now it's actually going to create your netlify site and then create a new repository in your github account and push all the code there and so you'll be working out of your own personal repository um so that's kind of how netlify is is working for us in this case um and then it's also going to be our our hosting site that pulls that code from github anytime that we make changes all right question time otherwise i'm going to send it back to kirsten okay uh adara screen is not visible um i mean we're streaming stream looks good we're streaming at 1080. so if it's a little blurry make sure you uh check your quality settings uh that you are in at least 720. um hopefully your connection is good all right so um uh let me just uh we're gonna i'm gonna list the things that this netlify deploy button does for you um it's kind of magic um and uh ryan talked about it a bit but let's just go over it again so that we we know what's happening so the netlify deploy button is going to create a new repository for you on github it's going to create a site on netlify and then link the two together um i i it doesn't it doesn't mention the last thing it's going to do which is it's going to build your repository make sure that there are no errors and then it's going to push that the the current contents of your repository to the site so let's go ahead and do that while you're clicking that button i see a few questions about can you use heroku i'm sure you could um yeah we don't have we and we probably should have you know a workshop that does that um as well yeah we can't um we can't troublesh if you run into issues we can't troubleshoot it for you in this case we are using notify that's part of this workshop um we really like i really like netify it's really cool you could you could use heroku if you want but again we can't troubleshoot yeah the only thing is i don't know um how or if they have serverless functions so yeah i don't i don't know i don't think they do but okay so um it's gonna create a new workshop for you a repository for you so this is gonna be um where your github repository what it's gonna be called now i actually created one yesterday so i'm gonna give it a little but um but you know remember this is actually gonna be created under your user in github so saving it to um to github okay so um so now you know here we are in netlify let's take a little look at what's happening here um the site deploy is in progress and we'll take a look at that in a moment but um you know there's there's settings um if you you know have used another system like heroku um you know you know that there's always going to be you know environment variables and stuff and um we've got a way to set these easily from the workspace um and we'll take a look at this after we do that um there you know it shows you where the repository is um you know it it's gonna the production branch is master you could tell it uh to use a different branch and on branch deploys you can tell it you know uh what what branch to to deploy so a deployed preview is great so you can actually uh go to a netlify before you deploy uh whatever changes you have you have a little test site you can use so that's fantastic so let's go ahead and take a look at so up here we have the site overview which is where we started we have deploys and um let's take a look at the site deploy in progress just to make sure that people are finding the uh link just fine if you go to the repo um and i'm i can paste the link again this will take you directly to the step that we're on um if you click on the uh what is it deploy to netlify button right it's here i'll show my screen real quick um if you haven't done it yet i would actually say you should open a third tab um and uh put the repository in there and then click the deploy to netlify because as you can see on mine i have um the repository and then astra and then netlify and the way i got this netlify over here was i copied this link and put it in a new tab so um this is just to make it easier to get back and forth obviously you can forward and back but that's kind of a pain um so um what it's doing is it's running npm install on on the repository so you can actually kind of see you know what uh what the code is looking for what is necessary for it to be able to uh to work um so um this is information about which version of network build we're using uh we've got a deploy id i believe that helps us with uh logs um finding information about our specific deploy um so it's it's going along right um we're we're and uh we're netflight building uh so it does a react scripts build um uh these are the functions from the functions directory i'll show you those in just a second um so um as it goes through um you see the build script succeeded now if there were errors it would not push the code to github one of the things that can be confusing is you can go to github and say well where's my code right um uh so um but it is pushing to the repository it hasn't uh yeah i think it's probably finished let's check but um before we go back to the new repository let's take a look at functions uh real quick there's a few questions that uh i wanna sure address okay sorry uh so there uh all right i'm gonna switch it over to my screen real quick um so site deploy in progress uh some people are seeing that but they can't see what you were seeing the the build logs right so if you click on that link that slide the progress link yeah and then you'll see this building um message let me i can make my screen a little bigger yeah and if you click on this this is a link as well if you click on that then you'll get that log and you can watch it do its thing um so that's how you get to the log um that was in addressing sarab pam and black deuterium again we are streaming at in 1080 so if if you want to just double check quality settings uh it's at least at 7 20. um it should be it should be good and i'm gonna uh cover one more thing um while we're here at netlify um you can you don't have to use that button right if you already have a repository on git and you want to um and you want to create a netify site associated with it you can do that as well right it'll just pull it in for you so um there's lots of different ways to get your code running on netlify and then again i will look at my naughty bins and uh you can actually look in the functions and see what the functions are all about what what um and um when a function actually i guess you can't see the code but um what you can do is you can uh search the logs to see when these are called right and and what happened right so if you're getting an error and you don't know why um you can come here you can look at the um the result of function calls that you've made okay so we'll get into the functions later yeah yeah ryan will cover that later but i'm just trying to give you kind of a tour of the netflix stuff um because it it feels kind of weird sometimes to be running stuff like in this abstract way so i want you to be able to find information that you're looking for so um i'm i'm gonna go to github now don't go back to the tab that is destax dev go to the github that is linked from the repository this is important um you don't have permission to make changes in our repository um sorry but um uh so so i oh hey it opened in a new tab how groovy is that all right so if you look at this um it's the same thing right except now you see i'm in synedra so over here i'm in data stacks devs in here i'm in scenario great okay so let's go past the netlify button um and if you wanna you know browse around and notify a little bit more um you know we you can go you can go through it um by following that some steps yeah give us a thumbs up in the chat if you have gotten this far if you've successfully built a netlify and um your repo has been pushed and you are navigated back to your personal repo i just want to make sure that we don't move too fast i know we're kind of eager to get to the good stuff yeah yeah um i definitely don't want to lose oh look at everyone's doing awesome great job folks i mean it's it's uh fun all right so um this is the git pod id now this is again um we're like we're like trying to remind you not not the data stack steps repository yes the sunedra or sonic dmg or whatever your username is um um and then uh here's instructions on um on how to get to where you're supposed to be all right so if you click here you get an open and give pod which is great are you using safari you will be sad when you click the button brave also has some issues as well so chrome and firefox will work right out of the gate so i open a git pod and and this preparing thing that's a good sign when i launch it in safari which i do a lot because i love safari it is my favorite and it has all of my my my my bookmarks and my quick links um it doesn't do that it just it's sad it's a very sad thing so kirsten if we if we also love safari and we will only use safari how do we how do we use the link if if it doesn't work well um let's take a look at um the markup that we have and i'll i'll give you a little bit of information so if um you just really want to use safari let's find that git hub button um so here um we're doing a little magic here from referrer um that actually you can put the specific repository in there and then it will work in safari but safari does not honor the magic of from referrer correctly um so um but you know i uh chrome is close enough for me so you know it's all good so what's happening here let's look at the git pod right so this is an ide right so we have um we have a readme we have a package.json you know this is a node.js application i can edit things here i can look at them over here um open things up and um generally um let's see how do we preview preview uh do you know how we get the preview up of the uh for the readme um i know the shortcut in vs code i don't know if it works on kpon uh open preview to the side all right good well that's there it is all right so now you don't have to keep going back and forth between the repository and the git pod the get pod is good this probably looks very similar it's the same stuff that we saw um in the build log um when we deployed to netlify so what gitpod is doing here is um we gave it some hints about what to do when starting the um the works it's called a workspace um and this is what we do right so we're just setting stuff up for you here um that's just a little bit of information in case you're like wow github is cool i or get pot is cool i i might like to use it for something um all right um now um we're just gonna make sure with a get remote minus b which is what's up here right um um oh look it's synendra great does it say data sex devs no um so um make sure that you're in the right works workspace and you know one of the great things about having your own repository is that you can play with it you know past the workshop you can you can um experiment and whatever yeah and replays mma reba's asked uh if they can use vs code instead of getpod absolutely you can work locally if you want to i know a lot of people prefer that i prefer to work locally a lot of the time too however gitpod we have set up gitpod to pull a bunch of stuff and and have an environment already set up that we know works so i know um someone answered your question uh already cedric uh mentioned that you do make sure that you have the correct version of node and the correct version of npm to make sure that all the tools that we're using work um that is the benefit of git pod it is it automatically loads that environment for you so feel free the other thing to know is that some people have had issues on windows um and you know we're trying to get that fixed up um probably this week but um if you have windows um i i i more strongly encourage you to use to use git pod um so that you have a good experience we we certainly don't want you to be frustrated so yeah so again feel free to to work locally if you'd like um but if you run into some issues ask us the question but there's a a limit to our ability to troubleshoot if you're working locally uh one person asked uh that i want to mention guitar mask um if your git pod is stuck on creating i've had that happen recently and my my browser was not updated try updating your browser if it doesn't fix itself all right so um we're going to do an npm install of netlify cli and what that's going to do is it's going to give us the ability in the workspace to uh talk to netlify about our site right so um so we have the code here and if we make a change to it like or or we want to work with the site itself um that's what the network my cli will go up so um as it turns out we already installed it for you but um ah oh oh right uh sometimes the uh guitar mask uh you said your browser is updated but it's still stuck uh it's because you have a lot of reposting in your github that should not be an issue um it could be that we uh i'll hit get overwhelming yeah it might take a little bit so let's let's wait a little bit kirsten before we move on i just want to make sure that everyone let's get some thumbs up give us a thumbs up if you are successfully getpod is up and running and you see basically what kirsten is seeing here um and i'll answer questions as we're waiting for that why don't we go ahead and generate our token and give git pod a little time to um uh beats by turbo yes netfly is a safe platform uh you should be good to go there um reynolds has a question oh it looks like cedric might have um helped him already uh instead of get button you have add file drop down instead where did i go wrong i'm not sure hopefully cedric can help you with that one that's an interesting problem um [Music] we have a few thumbs up which is good does git pod take time and creating yep it can take it could take a little bit longer when uh 350 people all at the same time um let's um let's go ahead and create our token and that'll give gitpod a little bit more time um and then hopefully by the time we get back we'll make sure everyone is good yeah and an answer to victor's question this is a bit of a recap of last week if you have a token from last week and you still have it you can use it it is perfectly valid still so if you already have a token from last week awesome you're done um but for those of you who are new we're going to create an authentication token for us to uh yes communicating um go back to astra so as you see i have the tab but again it's astro.datastax.com if you lost that tab um and uh the tokens are managed at the organization level not at the not at the dashboard at the database level what that means is that your tokens can be configured to provide access to multiple databases um so uh you can manage them how you want so we're gonna go to organization settings and then token management you see i have a lot of tokens but um first we have to figure out what role we want to attach to your token so um i'm gonna go with database administrator and you can see a database administrator can do pretty much everything um and that's what we're going to use for uh this workshop now obviously if you're making an application you're probably going to have some tokens that you give to app developers that have limited access to particular databases you know that's great um that we we have this it's very configurable but for now we're just gonna make a master token yeah and uh supriya asks a good question so the same token can be used for different apps it can be um i think you probably would want to create separate tokens for different apps so that you could control it a little bit more um but you can use it yeah it also helps um with uh with your logging right um you know uh to know who is making a call like one of the things about oauth is that you know you have an app associated with it and a user associated with it and um you know that information can tell you what particular apps are doing so here we are we've got client id and client secret you do not need those today do not copy them do not use them just leave them be um token is what we're gonna take but first because i know that i make mistakes sometimes i'm gonna download the csv um um these lovely strings that you have here will never be shown again by your browser you will not be able to get to them so if you ever think hey maybe i'm going to accidentally copy the wrong thing over my token then uh you just have a csv so i downloaded the csv and let's take a look at it um so it's it's generated token.csv and the piece that you're interested in starts with astra cs and goes to the next quote mark all right so i'm going to leave that we're going to need that token and what that token is going to do is it's going to make it possible for us to make sure you've created your database correctly and set up information about your databases id and the key space and various other things so uh did everybody get a token and save the csv let's have some thumbs up there yes russia uh as you can see i have many many tokens you can create as many as you want um if you um gave it to someone and then you don't want them to have access anymore then you need to delete those tokens right so or um if you accidentally check in something to github that has your token i i can't say that i've ever done that but if you did um you just want to make a new token that has the same permissions and um and delete the old token so that nobody can um what's up suck uh maylan it says do we have to download csv you don't have to download the csv but if you navigate away from this page uh you will not be able to get that token again you won't you won't be able to copy it so the csv kind of gives you a hard copy of it um so that's what you would you would want to you don't have to though um there's another question i have many databases how do i pick for which database i want to generate the token as kirsten said you generate the token on an organization level not on a database level so um the database administrator token is valid for any database so yeah so um and and uh there's a link on that page um here that says user permissions that talks about uh what each of the um the roles um give you access to and so the reason just so you know um that we're using database administrator is because we're going to use a devops api to create your table make sure you have the table and all that stuff um and then we'll use the the rest api for other things all right so here we are we're now going back to here and um let's uh is anybody still waiting for get pod to do its thing mine just finished if that gives anyone an idea of yeah so i mean i am i am fine with waiting a little bit longer so you guys can um can can jump in but we need to know if you're still having issues uh naylan the csv automatically is saved as file yes some browsers don't add the csv um suffix so you can just add dot csv uh you can open it from a text edit from text edit or from notepad or whatever it's it's just a text file really so so beats by turbo um astrodb is is valid um it will not spam your email um it will send you emails sometimes but when things happen with your database like um when you create a new database then it'll tell you it's creating the database and that it's created it um and um if uh if you get to that 80 it'll send you an email um telling you that you've reached that i'm not sure if you can configure uh what things uh spawn emails but it's it's not spammy and it it's not um uh if you if you are interested in the things that we're doing and you want more emails from us you have to sign up for our mailing list so uh sweet spot drummer asks where the git pod link is i'm going to show real quick so i'm going to switch to my screen um i just put a link in the chat for uh the section that we're on launch get pod ide and if you drop this down you see the click here to launch git pod if you oh hold on my face is in the way okay if you click on this arrow to drop that down this is the link that you want now as we said before chrome and firefox will use this link perfectly fine safari and brave um will have some issues with the referrer link so uh um i could let i'll ask um one of our mods to um uh put in it should be like getpod.io slash your repo address i guess i i'm not entirely sure what the format of it is but uh we can give you a format of that if if you're not using chrome or firefox but that's it's hidden a little bit because we want to make sure the reason why we hide is we want to make sure that you're working out of your repo not out of ours so that's why we hide it but yeah it's just behind this little arrow okay okay so i guess it seems like we are um we're we're doing well now i'm going to copy and paste something and um and and that means that my clipboard is not going to have the token can you can you mac like uh zoom in a little bit a couple of people it's never too big is that good i think that'll be good let us know if if it is small for you guys um because at some point you're going to be wanting to show the code and if it's much bigger it'll be hard to talk about anyways so um i am ruchi what uh what error is it throwing the uh nullify cli error if it's just that there are some vulnerabilities that's typical npm for you but if there's a specific error let us know yeah i mean you can you can run the audit if you if it makes you feel better um so i'm now going to run uh the astra setup command and what that astra setup command is going to do is um and and just say yes it's fine um is it is going to take my token um and uh it's going to make sure that there is a um uh a tick tock workshop db right and a tick tock key space um and if they don't exist it will just make them for you so um i'm going to go over here to the document that i downloaded and then i'm going to copy that and paste it here now just to make sure you have the right one it must start with astro cs and a colon right that is the token that you're looking for okay so it's like i know who you are i'm looking for the workshop to be great it's all good um and i'm looking for the key space okay great we are ready to go um if you didn't create the database or if you gave it a different name um it'll just create it for you it'll take a few minutes because the database does have to activate um and now i'm going to run netlifedev we're going to get to play with code in just a few minutes and this should yeah so it opens it up for you um it doesn't there is is what is up with that um um do i have to open that in a different browser oh yeah yeah yeah the you click on that little arrow to the right of that uh url oh open in that extra yeah this yeah i know to the right oh at your house yeah i can see it okay so uh we're gonna launch it in an external tab um maria it's a it's a tick-tock clone sometimes you have to like click in the middle for it to um load stuff up but we haven't really put any data in there yet yes uh maria asks so after typing git remote dash v at get pod we're also going to type the github data stack steps link no just get remote dash v to make sure that you are um in your github repo not the data stacks dev's repo that's just to double check um there was another one that i wanted to uh re refresh real quick kirsten it doesn't have um an initial load of data um that after refresh should is not maybe yours well is it not okay i'm still i'm still trying to catch up i've been answering questions um uh command reload nope all right well let's get all the um the the linky stuff working let me look at my astrid um my uh says npm exec doesn't work but npx does did you successfully go through the process then um because if you're working locally and don't have the correct node version npm exec does not work but if it mpx does i guess that is good right it it it sort of works sometimes npx um uh anyways so um what else did you be and what um astra setup did is uh it created this dot emv file and it this has information about um my oh that's what he meant by kill it and start again okay um uh so you can see that we've got the uh it's an admin token i'm also using it as an application token because some of our code uh uses that instead um and um and this should work now except that it is just not loving me all right let's try it again it worked in the um gift pod it's very strange um let me kill this again and go back to here yeah see it's got it's got the stuff in it now so we're good so you can see this is what you're going to end up with is you're going to end up with a little tik-tok application here now that's kind of cool and i suppose you could share your get pod with the world but that's not what you want to do right we want netlify to host our content for us so that we can share it with all our friends so um so what we're gonna do is we're gonna do a few things to teach my workspace about the site that i wanted to use so remember we made a site and it's associated with the github but it is not necessarily associated with this workspace so now we need to tell um tell it to associate with workspace so you're going to need to control c out of the netlife dev um we or or you can open a second terminal if that is comfortable for you um then we're gonna do a netlife login now this is a little tricky because um uh browser ides do not actually open links correctly so what we want is no i i want that i want that and copy it for me yes okay so um you need to open another tab and paste in that link fortunately it will tell the um and authorize fortunately it's going to go ahead and tell the um the netlify uh cli that it was successful so um so now we've we've uh we've done the login and then we're gonna do uh netlify link and what that does is it says um do you want me to look for um a site that uses the same github repository that you're using that's exactly what we want right so um it's not a benz that's just the one i'm using now um remember that um i i showed you the environment variables and like i said um in netflix just like in heroku and all those other hosting sites um it is a pain to set your environment but this makes it possible for you to take your emv file which is where we have the information right and send uh no import dot enb and send those to uh to netlify so let's go look at our um our netlife uh this yes okay so here we are at the naughty bins right we know that's the right one let's look at the site settings so build and deploy environment um did not happen did it um let's see if we reload it yes okay so uh you see we we got our our environment variables all set which is great copying and pasting is a pain this way you're sure the same values are in your emv file and up on the site um now in order to make that happen um uh we we need to build the site and we need to deploy it again now you're probably thinking why do i need to deploy it again you already have it it's it's working fine um but um those environment variables will not actually um uh update um until we do a new deploy it doesn't make sense like i think they should do a deploy if you update your environment variables but uh that's not how it works so uh we're going to do an applied build uh alan you are quite far ahead of us so uh we'll have to catch up to you before we can answer that question um that's for step 11. so i see a few people running into an issue an error that comes through when running astra setup i actually ran into the same issue i'm working on a fix at uh right now i will address it shortly once uh okay i get through it um but yeah i i am seeing that same thing so um stay with me um someone asked what net levi dev does oh netlify dev runs a local version of the code that you have in your workspace um or if you're on your local system it'll it it'll just put it on uh i think 88.88 or something so you can test and work with your code without having to deploy it every time right um and uh so we've done another five build we're gonna do that netify deploy to production now in uh in the real war world you would likely deploy the staging and and then test it and then but we're doing a workshop so we're just going to skip over all that um rigor and jump right to doing things all right great so then you can just say netlify open colon site which makes yes it does so you can see up here now we're not looking at the git pod link anymore right the uh link we're using is uh is a netlify link and there's my not events oh so real quick i see um i see a few people who are saying that they're still waiting for authorization after netlify login so netlifylogin gives you a url in the terminal that you need to copy and paste in a new tab to to continue that connection it'll it's just going to be waiting there in the terminal until you do that so if it's if you're still waiting for it you need to copy that url and paste it into a new tab yeah so so you know this here where it says opening this it doesn't actually open that so um so uh we need to um we need to uh go to the the extra the extra tab and um and authorize it all right um so i believe that it is ryan's turn so let's go ahead and take some questions and anybody who's stuck um please um um for site id um maria you want to pick the the site that has the same code as your repository you can't get to the part with netlify login are you using safari uh gabriel doesn't like the link either you need to use chrome or firefox where farah [Music] um so um netlify link will connect this folder to a site on notify how do you want to link this folder to the site use the current remote origin and then it looks for the matching site for you you don't need a site um hey kirsten can i see your uh env file real quick uh sure so i am so i know a few other people are running into the same issue that i am running into and i don't really know what the problem is um it's creating later today so when i run an astro setup and some of you may be facing the same issue here i'll show you what happens [Music] give me one second uh so you see this error the request fail this is what i'm running into as well um uh uh so we're gonna have to probably build the in the die envy manually in this case um i i tried clearing caches and all that kind of stuff which has had that um issue yeah that's let me on let me see if i can just check it one more time so variables so yeah no environment variables so um we're gonna have to create this uh a little bit more manually it does the the keys for me which i guess is useful since um i don't think that's it's not able to connect to the to the um to the database so we're gonna need to um get those other things so let me see what your env looks like so we're going to need um the let me id yeah i'm gonna um make that more careful way i'll just i'll walk people through it so those of you who need to do it manually with me um pay attention i'm gonna walk through how we're gonna do this all right so in your astra account right we're right here i'm going to click on your uh tick tock workshop db down here and then at the top there's a connect tab click on the connect tab and we're going to use the document api so that's all good i have to scroll down because my windows i'm zoomed in but yours should probably be to the right of it and it's this thing right here this block right here we can actually uh copy this whole block using the widget but this is going to include our dbid our db region and our db key space um it also includes a software for our application token but we already have that so we'll just delete that when we get it so if you use this um this widget to copy it and then we'll go back to our git pod and at the end of this line i'm just going to hit return and paste this in i'm going to get rid of that last line i'm going to get rid of this export because we don't need it does the dot um require the quotes i do not recall it does it does not require them okay it doesn't care but it doesn't require them okay well then i'll probably take them out because all right so if i save that um then this whole astro setup part we can skip because that's what the astra setup does so that should get us back to if you're running into that error this process should get us back on track um cool and now i'll try to i'll try to figure out what's going on with that um so i'll run network my dev i'm just going to confirm that this works for me and then i have to pop this out into a new tab all right i'm going to did you ever get the content to load is that still something that we're facing um i i restarted it and then it loaded it oh you researched i restarted that yeah you're having errors anyways let me restart notify def i i think you might need the quotes oh no okay no no you don't cool all right so i'm gonna pop this out again yeah weirdly it actually loaded correctly in the git pod browser part in the git pound browser yeah so go ahead up the simple browser the orange tab you got there um so for me that one actually ended up working but oh you know what alan what are you getting uh you know what i think you're right this is embarrassing i don't think it's my fault no it's not it's not your fault i'm gonna try a new token uh because we we regularly delete our tokens because we obviously show them here on stream and i'm pretty sure oh shoot uh do the astra set uh remove your emv file and start astra setup again because i think that is why it okay i'll do that i should probably stop this huh all right here we go and i will make astra setup smarter about no your credentials are not good hey it was my it was my token guys all right so if you're having this problem make sure you copy the astra cs token um and not any other token yeah and it does have to include the astra cs part it's not just the jumble of letters so all right all right so thank you kirsten you are very kind so um let's uh so uh i think um i i people still may have some questions um but we're gonna move on to the code next so um let us know how you're doing there we go yeah give us a thumbs up um if you have gotten to the point where you ran netlify dev and see it in the getpod browser um let's see there's got to be some questions uh s kumar asks where do you normally store the token in dev qa production environment so the code can pick up the right token um it's in the environment variables uh so the reason we use environment variables is because we don't want to expose this these credentials uh to like public repos right so the dot env is going to be ignored by git and it won't be copied to your github repository um so we have the env for our development right but then we also save these environment variables on netlify and that's what that netlify link netlify login stuff did is that it took these uh environment variables and uploaded them to netify so that it had a source to get these uh these credentials um but yeah that's so that's why we don't we don't store them in variables or in any like javascript files or anything like that we we want to keep those things secret but it but it's pretty standard and um i'll also point out that most ci systems like travis and uh jenkins um have the ability for you to set environment variables within them as well so um it's it's a it's a very standard way to keep secure information um but be able to run the same uh code in multiple places um all right let's see bram it works but i don't know why yet we'll go over some of the we we wanted to get you to a point where it's working and then we're going to go over some of the some of the details stuff yeah so we have 40 minutes how are we doing on time i think we're okay um i think we're okay yeah um interstellar accidentally closed their uh their terminal their terminal uh where what's the terminal button terminal if you if you get this this menu on the top left and then terminal and you can click new terminal that's fine um hamburger menu that's what it's called david thank you having error failed to compile interesting that's a new one need more information yeah is that when running that if i dev where's jam set coming in here we can go over that tick tock launched awesome all right keep the questions coming we have moderators that'll answer the questions and we'll address them when we can but given the time i want to go over uh some of these questions some of these things so jamstack where's james coming in so this is a jam set application right javascript apis and markdown so our javascript is here in our source we are using react as the basis so we have our pages right we have our home page and that's going to push our html here this is our markdown that we're using it's going to push our our html um and our components to the virtual dom uh we went over this in week one kind of our basic react app uh so that's our javascript that's our markdown and our apis and that's what we want to focus on in this week is how that api part of it worked um so we are using as we have said many times we are using serverless functions now what are serverless functions and i actually have a um a funny gif um the serverless functions mean that uh we're just gonna get rid of the server no servers just unplug those those bad boys um certainly not right we're still using a server but we're not actually responsible for this for the backend infrastructure anymore we don't have to build up a server server app that you know takes requests and and serves back the information we're going to use netlify for that and so this is how netlify is is structured we have our our front end right we have the build system on netlify that's going to take our code from github and build it and push it to the the front end um and then it's going to provide um end points for our serverless functions that we can then call from our front end to get our information right so our function.js files our serverless functions will be served via api and so we actually develop those things simultaneously with our with our front end and i'll show you what that looks like so in our if you go to your just your basic um let me zoom in i always have to zoom in right all right so if we go to our root in our git pod you will see a netify.toble this is a configuration file for nutify this is going to tell netlify a few things first it's going to give the command on on how to build our app npm run build pretty standard react uh script um that's just gonna tell how to build our app then it's going to uh we're going to tell it where to find our functions where are we storing our serverless functions so that i can use those to create uh the endpoints that we can call and then our publish you know once it's built the folder that you can find all the files in is called build once you're run build that's not as important so functions are stored in our functions folder so let's go to our functions folder right here so this is our serverless functions right this is outside of our source our source is all of our front and stuff but then when we want to create um a a backend function say for retrieving data or adding data or whatever we're going to create a serverless function in this folder and so this is an example of let me scroll down on our repo here this is an example of one of those functions right so we're going to export our our asynchronous function and this is what it's going to do right so anytime we have one of these files so this is add.js netify is going to search this folder this functions folder and see okay i've got an add.js file it's in the functions folder so it's obviously a serverless function i'm going to create an endpoint for this file and it's going to create it in a very consistent way that we can count on um it's going to be like netlify slash function slash add in this case and we can actually see that if we go to um actually i haven't done the netify link stuff yet but if you go to your netlify site um kirsten do you mind navigating to your functions just a tech hi i'm uh are you keyboard warrior i was i was yes um all right so um you want to see my what go to go to your netify site and go to the functions page okay i don't believe it oh let's just um go there so on the top you see that um oh no not the not the actual type the the five back end that you were just in okay yep all right so on the top there's the the tab functions go ahead and click click the functions tab i'm kind of walking into it so you can see uh think thank you kirsten this is i'll just uh talk through this part okay go back one page go backwards tell me when to click yeah this is good you can go back to keyboard warrioring um okay so this is um what netlify sees in our functions folder right it's gonna search this functions folder and it's going to create these endpoints and so it's got add add data edit and posts and if i go back to my code you can see we have add add data edit and post and so it's detected these files and it's created the endpoints right and so those endpoints are usually.netify function slash whatever the name of the of the file is and so that's the endpoint that we can call to execute this function that we've that we've defined um so if we talk a little bit about how this is working um if we go to the utils uh folder so this is not technically a serverless function but it's the utility that we're using um to to make everything work this is how we connect to our database right so we have our astrodb we have our credentials that we've stored in environment variables and we're using the astrojs collections library now this is the library that is used for the document api that we're using and one of the things that we do is we we we have a function here called getastra client and we are creating a client basically a connection to our database and we're giving it these environment variables right so we've stored our dvid we stored our region and we've stored our application token and it's going to use this information to create a connection to our database and then it's going to create something called a client that we can use then to manipulate it yes kirsten um so i'm i'm not uh sure that everybody definite dust knows exactly what a document database is um are there other databases that are document databases that they might be familiar with like yes  is a document uh database so document the document based document oriented databases are primarily schema-less databases we use them to store uh basically json objects usually um it's uh that are called documents um and it's just kind of a way to very quickly store information without having to worry about creating tables or a schema or anything like that we're just going to store these documents get a document i store these objects as documents get a document id and we can retrieve that information later so that's kind of the basic rundown of document-oriented dbs now astra is based on apache cassandra which is not technically a document oriented db but we have the api layer that allows us to use it as a document-oriented dp and if you want to learn more about how we do that we have another workshop called introduction to nosql databases and we dive a little bit into how that works as well as a bunch of other nosql database styles so not really inside the scope of today's um no i just i just wanted to make sure that they understood like we're gonna upload json documents and then they can do operations on those documents uh based on the contents of the documents right so you can look for things that you know have a matching field or whatever so um it's pretty cool i mean you know especially for something like this yeah yeah so and i'll i'll touch on like how we're power using these documents um in a little bit but first i'm talking about like how we're how we're creating that initial connection to our database and we do that by creating a client providing the credentials and and it connects us to that database and now we have a client that we can use um to to manipulate that uh manipulate that information and one of the things that we then do is we have another method called get collection that lets us get to the um the collection of documents right all the documents are stored in in something called the collection and now we are kind of in our environment um that that we can then search all of our documents so in this case you know we're we're getting the the client right that we've already defined um we're providing the namespace which is our key space um and then we are defining the collection tick talk posts right and this when this is first called we'll actually create that collection tick talk posts um and then we can then uh use it to to store our documents in um so let's this is add data so when we first launched our tick tock app this method or this function ran this is add data this is what populates all that initial kind of filler information that we have up there um so so you can see what kind of data we are working with and as kirsten said we are working with objects so this right here that i've highlighted is an object we have you know id we have the name we have the username we have the avatar image um we have some information whether they're followed or not we have the link to the video that they've posted the caption um likes comments all these different things um that we are storing as a blob as just an object that we can then retrieve based on its id and so this is the all the data that is initially put in so we have that kind of a boilerplate and then we have uh the code here let's see so we've created a const called posts and we're awaiting git collection right so we're going to retrieve that collection that we have defined uh which is tick-tock posts remember and then we've defined this array of objects that we're going to then push into our database right and so post which is our collection dot create is a method um and if we go through let me scroll down a little bit i'm kind of jumping around a little bit just because we're running a little bit out of time uh sorry no it's not like it's okay so please keep questions coming i know i'm going a little bit fast i want to make sure we touch on some of some of the prime aspects of this um but for the document api we have a few main methods and i'm just gonna go over the the three that we are using here that's create update and find so in this case we're using the create method and what this does is um i'm actually just navigate to the add.js so imagine we have an object that we want to add right we've created a post we want to add it to our collection so we have our um [Music] our collection right we've defined it as users in this case and then we're going to do users.create right create is our method that we're using we're going to give it an id and then we're going to give it the body of our object and so what this does is it's going to create a a document with that id that we've given a specific id and it's just going to provide the body of that document and it's going to store it very simple right that's how the the create method um generally works now update so we have edit right we're using the update method so now we're providing a id right so now we we have a reference on what what object am i updating right so i give it the id and then i give it the body again and so it says okay i should have a document that has this id already i'm going to take that i'm going to upsert the the body right overwrite anything that's different and then save it and then we have our find method so when we're retrieving our data um for display right we use the find method so uh the find is basically just going to retrieve all of the um in this case we are giving it an empty and empty set right so if there's there's no criteria or no filters um it's just going to retrieve all of our posts that we have or all of our um documents that we have in our tic tac posts collection um and and push them back to the to the front end um in production you probably would have some type of filter like f you know people that you have followed right give me every all the posts by people that i am following right um so those are the three main methods create update and find um and and so this is the basic structure of a serverless function right we are getting our connection to our database in this case we're getting a collection that we're working in and we're using the built-in methods given our um our astrojs library our document api library and the return um you know we're we have a try block here we're going to hopefully get a return of 200 which means we were successful and the body is going to be our object that we are expecting um and if we get a 500 means something bad happened and we need to figure that out um and so once we've defined all these serverless functions they will be served to us by an endpoint by netlify and we can see how that looks in let's see is it in card let's see i want to see trying to find the reference on the on the front end might just be at home yeah okay so so when we first run the app right we it it did that i call that function add data right so this is this is that add data function um we are using axios which is a library for uh api calls and we're using the post method of axios and we're calling this i endpoint.netfly.netify function slash add data right and so our url which is in your case kirsten something really funny that i can't remember but it'll be our website slash dot netify slash function slash add data that is our endpoint our api endpoint when we hit that it will run that that serverless function and return all of that data in this case it just runs an add data right it pushes that data to the um to the database um and then here's where we fetch the data right we have our our same url but we're using posts right so we're pulling all the posts and then we're receiving the results um and we're setting the users we're using the setup users function and giving it that data from the results all right i know that that was quite a bit of information uh all packed in there questions you know and they can be questions about you know why and how we're putting the functions separately um you know uh how the interaction works i mean um you know this is this is your time and and uh you know i'll i'll tell you that um the um uh sorry the the second part of the homework is actually a video that tells you how to build this whole thing from scratch so for those people who are like well i was thinking about you know i thought i thought we were going to build a thing well you know we don't really have time to go through the whole building part um in this workshop but um so we're providing you with the code so you can run it but you could also start a new repository and follow anya's uh video tutorial which is is it's a quite quite a good tutorial so and and onya's tutorial goes into more in depth into you know building up from scratch going into the ui part of things um obviously you know we have our are you out here which never actually all right i've used a simple browser okay all right no i'm good we have our ui here right which is already built for us because it was included in the in the code um she goes into more in more depth in how that part of the ui stuff is built um so if you're more interested in that um obviously you know we only have two hours we can only cover so much we wanted to get the basics on how serverless functions work because it's a really really useful and powerful thing but if you want to go over the ui stuff her video is the place to do that and i put the link in the chat it's also in the repo and it is linked in the homework section as well as the bottom um for you to check out all right so we have a few more minutes um we can answer questions we also have to get to our quiz oh yeah totally um [Music] um kind of uh felipe um mongoose is actually a library it's not it doesn't create apis for a mongodb mongodb by its nature is a document um ap a document db which exposes its um its data via a rest api so stargate makes astra more like uh it used to be you could only use cql to talk to your data and uh stargate extends that so that if you're more comfortable working with apis whether it's graphql or rest or or a document api it translates that for you so that you can work with your cassandra data all right cam thank you awesome i'm glad that you were able to get everything working that's really good to hear um akash you kind of lost your repo uh oh uh i mean it should still be there yeah it should still if you go to um to back to github oh oh oh sorry uh that's a continuation of a previous comment about last week's stuff oh okay uh last workout can i get the link to the to-do list we made last time which had a netlify in it where i can connect to my astrodb um i can give you the link to uh the the repo from last week for sure um if that's what you're asking yeah and also uh i just want to point out that um if you guys are ever trying to find a workshop that we did we are that all of our workshop stuff is in data stacks devs so you can always just go to our list of repositories and right now um the two top links on our repository pages are last weekend this week um so homework all right so in the repos you will see at the top of the of the repo um some of the homework is laid out it's really just follow the steps get your tick tock app to deploy um to get a screenshot of that if you want to go through the swagger ui stuff that we unfortunately had to skip that would be great again again your tokens might be visible on swagger ui so if you do that make sure you do not screenshot any of your tokens or if you do to blank them out right um so here's what you're going to do to submit homeworks uh you go to our repo right so we're on week two tick tock you go to the issues tab you click on new issue and then there will be a template for homework assignment right you can click the get started button on the homework assignment and then we'll have a pre-populated um template right so at the top the the subject line you'll have the homework tag and you'll put your name i think it comes with like brackets around the name get rid of the brackets you just need your name um and then at the top of the of the actual submission thing you have your name email and linkedin profile in order to get a badge we do need your name and we do need your email um so make sure you you fill those in and then you add your screenshots of your homework to the uh issue report um and then we will over the next week uh we will probably have a lot again um we still have a couple like we mentioned that we have to catch up from last week but we will be grading them over the course of the next week and when you receive your uh your grade we will issue you a badge and you can use that on different social media um like like linkedin and stuff and if you get all three badges um you can get the golden badge uh and also an entry to win that uh amazon gift card that we mentioned before um uh i also want to point out that um the the homework is an interaction so uh with this homework it's not quite as difficult like to understand what we're asking for but um if you turn in your homework and it's not quite right it's not like you're host right um the reason it takes us a little while to get through the homeworks is because we manually uh humans actually look at your homework and um and review it so if you did if you got something that wasn't quite right you know we'll we'll let you know and uh and you'll be able to resubmit it no problem so um so you know don't feel like yeah you have to get it perfect or if something isn't clear um you know give it a shot and we'll let you know if uh we think you need to um tune some things up uh yeah that's a good point we uh it is not automated we have to we do it manually um and we will have a conversation in that you know in those issues reports with you on how to improve your um your uh homework if it needs improvement this one is pretty simple uh to the question someone asked so the homework is just going through the steps in the repo yeah it pretty much is um we just want to make sure that that everyone was successful and followed through the workshop and and did the work so it's kind of a way to do that as well there is the optional portion as well which is watching anya's video which goes much more in depth in some of the front end ui stuff so obviously that's optional we you know we don't know if you've watched it but we recommend it so workshops that are coming up if you go to datastax.com workshops you'll be able to see all the upcoming workshops but a couple of the um uh ones coming up is on the 20th we are doing a kubernetes workshop uh dealing with ingress management with traffic proxy so if you are interested in that uh you can join us there and then of course next week we have our final week of our summer series uh where we will be building a netflix clone and this one has been we've done this one before and it's been very popular um and we'll be doing uh the graphql api in this one so if you're interested in learning more about graphql or you just want to make a cool netflix clone join us next week uh for that one it'll be a lot of fun for other workshops um uh we have so we we have more than just those two coming up we have workshops pretty much every week sometimes multiple workshops a week um so again datasacks.com workshops is a place uh to find those you can also subscribe to our youtube channel we have all of our past workshops uh recorded and we save them and you can watch previous um previous workshops that are stored there so take a look through our backlog on our youtube channel and see if anything there interests you we do um repeat those workshops quite regularly a lot of times we do like intro to nosql or intro to cassandra which are some some pretty good foundational workshops and we do repeat those from time to time so if you'd like to catch a live version of that keep an eye on that website and um and you'll see when we go live also if you subscribe you'll get notified when we go live as well i just wanted to plug our discord one more time and i'm going to put a link in the in the chat as well um if you have continuing questions obviously when the stream is over we can't uh answer questions in the youtube chat right because it's gone if you go to discord and join our discord i will be able to answer your questions continue like continuing on and it's a really good place to build community and and um kind of learn from each other and uh and it's just a really good place uh to get information and and to hang out so well and i also want to point out that a lot of our community members are amazing um astro users and they'll answer questions but also um you can bounce your ideas off of people it's not just for asking questions about workshops it's you know a community of people who are working with cassandra so yeah all right well with that uh black teacherium the new homework you can find it on the github repo it's towards the top there's a whole section for homework um yep yeah we're doing q a right i i don't think so not this week um well actually i mean if people want to stay for a little bit um we could we could i suppose um nathan griffin where do you find past workshops again um on our youtube channel um go ahead and if you go to videos like it'll be a very recent video because we just did it last week um so you can you can watch those videos there um the repo will also be in the description of those videos and it's the same um so um and if you already have that badge um it'll count towards your gold gold badge um monstrum um datastax does not provide them but that is actually one of the things that the discord channel is amazing for um you know you can talk to people who have done other things with the database and you can ask for help and you know if we can help we'll help and uh the community members like i said we have some that are just amazing so um i i go hang out there you know uh prium uh has a question i'm getting only one response from id3 on set 14. so make sure your page size is increasing the swagger ui defaults to one so it'll only return one document uh so i think you can go up to 20 let's just set it to 20 and it'll get all the documents yeah that's just a limitation of swagger ui just to make sure it doesn't get overloaded i guess um all right so um with that thank you so much for joining us uh we really appreciate you being here um and uh we hope you guys learned a lot and had a good time um join us next week uh for uh week three our final week for the netflix phone and uh we'll see you then see ya and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of cassandra who grew those powers until she can multiply it will move with limitless speed and unmask hidden knowledge with those powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous feats",
