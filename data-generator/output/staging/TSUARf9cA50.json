gonna play fortnight and I'm gonna be right we actually have a twitch channel which is but we're gonna be twitch streaming tonight because we're playing around with ideas like not everybody can show up to a meet-up it's not easy and you may be a what if you lived in Sacramento its Sacramento who has a meetup in Sacramento no way right so we're gonna invite you welcome to Sacramento person or load up okay so there you're part of our studio audience well done this is gonna be like a taping of Conan O'Brien so you will show up the laugh track than ever you have to laugh really so tonight we're gonna gonna have two talks we're gonna start out with ceedric hello ceedric hello he's been doing a lot of work with the reactive part of our new driver and it is very crippling when you're doing asynchronous programming with Cassandra changes the game quite a bit we had a long talk about it today and I'm I'm actually gonna change some of my code now thank you very much and this will be very interesting and then and then I will get up here and tell you five ways make a database need them up awesome and if you don't want to hear me talk ever again but I'll let you take it from here okay so thank you good evening okay you're still sleepy so I got three question for you at the beginning as usual so who's among you is a Java developer I was using Java okay Alfe so you will see a lot of java code in this presentation don't be afraid just simple Java code so and for those folks who using Java who is actually using the castle hard driver okay not that many you Mike Levin I'm a developer advocate as dead as tax I'm French based in Paris leukemic and as developer advocate we tend to provide you tons of content to make you succeed with Apache Cassandra can be training can be a reference application sample code getting started Academy that acts like um a YouTube channel live stream on Twitch and many things so at the end of the presentation I will give you a million link just to get you all the slides and everything you need to exactly do the same things I'm doing tonight so this is my day job and I night I put my mask my boots and my cap and I become an open source developer so I created six years ago an open-source framework named FF og meaning video flipping for Java and the goal is to enable or disable part of your application at runtime without restarting and I'm also contributing to another open-source framework name Cheops tur which is you provide that to your entities and relation and it will generate for you a full working application back-end spring boot front-end JavaScript you can choose among viewed reactive view react and angular angular 8 oh no it is outdated already right it was released last week okay so tonight for so introducing the driver to something what a change and then I will go into the reactive stuff so are we I've created the same service in three ways synchronous asynchronous and reactive and we work through them each time a demo to explain what change what has a limitation of each approach so first drive at you okay so I will go fast though if you don't use that much so Drive of v1 I won't go to into the details what change against driver v1 but here is a secret session so we get rid of an object called a cluster and crystal conflict so now everything is under Lee the sequel session it's Auto close a belt that may need to be closed by itself you need to have a single sequel session in your own application and do everything with this object then each time you need to access casts on how you will create statements it's not new this is our simple statement and you will execute the statement get a result set and pass the result set okay so far so good and today yes today we just released something called an object mapper which allows you to do some mapping between the tables in your database and your own objects so I don't like you if you look at the maven central and go for the mapper it has been just released today which is nice so what can you do with the mapper well I don't have a simple code just couple left of I've got for you but as I told you just define your entities put some annotation define the name of your service and what you want to achieve create a mapper so no code no query nothing no sequel just code an annotation and then you will be able to execute queries when queries and map form object to your tables so I will now switch first time switching to code and I will do that a couple of time tonight okay so this way okay so in the driver you expect to have some contact points but local DC key space and which is something's new with driver two you need it to provide a comm file and the comm file is in Elkin format and you know what the first time I saw that file I say Oh what the hell but a new what's a new configuration file what yes yet another config file and I don't like these sand tax so hopefully from 4.2.1 we provide a way to inject configuration from anywhere using a configuration provider so if I go there and see there is a new object called programmatic driver configuration loader builder its sole long name it could fit into spring framework actually so you've got here the way to inject the configuration into the driver and what we do is just picking the information from this file ok so once you inject you all your properties to start up the driver you will define your queries so I just created a couple of statement here as you see in the first slide so those are simple statement nothing new I will use you know something used something called a schema builder or a query builder to get my statements and which is not with this code is not only we created the simple statement as bin spring bin but later we also define the prepare statement has been so even using spring with just three pairs of statement it's a nice little nice trick to do and once you get all your statement ready to go then we will start to work and we invoke this statement using sink I think and react so if I go back to my slide and say what about synchronous okay what are the sweet spot of Apache casona these things will add me to choose the use case I would like to show you so first time Cassandra is distributed there is no point to install a single node that is distributed among the node and that is replicate the note and it's there is no master that means you can lose any of the note and it's still up so it's always on pretty hard to kill second sweet spot it's the scalability you all know me or maybe not but in a single note of guess on how you can go up to about one 3,000 transaction per CPU and per second and what in with about one terabyte and if you need more throughput at new node and if you need more capacity at new node its scale and linearly and last but not least is the global distribution and maybe you heard about this use case lately in the news or something you may install that data center that ring one in AWS one an azure one on GCP one on premise and all those node will communicate to each other you can write anywhere with anywhere and the data will be replicated for you among the different node and different rings that mean you can go a bit cloud multi-cloud easily same database same lay some data layer everywhere in the world no more duplication on your side no need so fancy moving files or something so in the reactive world we most want I speak speak about speed and foot put so the scalability is the thing I would like to dig in so scalability can be volume and can be throat ports here I will dig into throughput and what base you schedule what base use case that time series to have a huge throughput so I won't show you a lot of sequel tonight so but this is the table I will work with with the stock table symbol value date symbol is the partition key because I want to get all the stocks information coming from a single symbol in a single partition and I use the date as a clustering : I put that date as desk because I would like to the latest even first because I would like to draw some nice curve based on symbol and as I work at that as tax I just add a little bit of magic so d for TTL and the compaction strategy fitting the no secret the time series use case okay so what about the application now okay if I put Cassandra on the right path and my client you want to invoke on the left in the middle this is application I bid for you and it's returned in no surprise Java latest version of Java the driver again no surprise it the data stacks driver driver to I expose my service as an API a REST API by the way and all the glue all the framework inside is spring I already did not speak about spring two or three times and when I need to invoke those application I will simply create a unit test using G unit five which is a latest version of unit and some spring classes so let's go with the first implementation of ourselves okay so I just close that so Zeit application is built in Ivan MIDI module maven project that means I will have multiple implementation I would provide you the source code anyway so first module is synchronous if I go to the lowest lower level in the repository here I got all the statement I just defined in the common path just before so they are injected that mean they are just imported at runtime and if I want to find all the symbol in my table well pretty simple I will use my prepared statement I will bind get a bound statement that means I will associate parameter with some question mark in the query executes microwave get my result set and then trick I would like to do some paging I would like the record from lower bound to upper bound so I just put my razor set as a stream iterate and find the first and the last using a limit and skip you know it's part of the stream API pretty easy to do start and end and for each single record I will use a mapper to find my object and if you notice before now we got the object mapper from today so I won't have to do that anymore from today but I didn't change the code yet just released I told you is very pretty recent so this is my repository and on top of it I will create a controller so it's a rest I reuse the spring REST API and if I go to my find I mean list symbol it's straight to the point invoke the DAO get my stream return my stream and that's it and I do have a small test for you I can run that sample first demo finger cause here we go I don't want everything and just want my own stuff here you go I just want my fine stocks when Rinna's do unit test it's not like I did that 20 times today okay here we go and if we go to a data stack studio which is a nice web UI to work with Cassandra I can see that I should have my stock table filled and my key space demo and stock table feed for me okay so that's sync and that's pretty easy straight to the point so what does when we just see so first when we initialize a condition it's always synchronous and later today I will switch to asynchronous and reactive and each time to initialize the connection I need to execute the very same code and it's synchronous so at startup you may lose some seconds but later you will of course gain a lot a lot of speed and for the result set well we initialize the statement at the beginning they are paths and if you make a mistake in your cql statement you will see you right away at the startup and afterward you will just push the parameter through the Casanova node and on the Cassandra node you will you will have already all the pre-pasted the prepare the context prepare to execute your query and you won't have to pass the full query only the parameters though those justing synchronous okay what about the service are invoking something I passing the parameters bind invoke asanga go back get my rigid set past the rigid set get my result and finally we get the result all that time the customer waiting for the records and we need to wait up to the end of the query to get the results so this is not what we want right even if synchronous is simple easy to test and maintain a simple brother and you're ready to go to Oh service well as you can see it's blocking and you lose a lot of time and if it's blocking you're looking some resources disk CPU whatever and you cannot scale scale up as much as you will so first approach will be to switch from sink to a synchronous and see if we can get rid of the blocking and the scalability issue so I get my services I want to put that services I think which technical stack will you pick to expose NASA News Service GMS mqp kafka no okay from GI x RS 2.0 rest is already a synchronous so you don't need all this fancy Africa cluster to make a simple icing service it's working out of the box just using some annotation to make the service I think it works both for the service and for the clients yes so no change and let's see what we did with the code okay demo number two let's go to eclipse then ok so module number two I think and I will show you first the repository the lower-level way to access your services find all symbol and I bound exactly the same as sync but now I have the execute as sync method and I won't return a result set but a complication stage and only when the stage is finished complete then I will compose two to get my stream and row mapper and I need to find a range of record I put a limit start and end the now everything is icing so I don't know actually when I will get my last element I need maybe I will go over multiple page before I was able to get the number of attempted so I need to create something called a row collector which is something like that so I need to count by myself to know if I got enough information yeah of course I don't have a stream I don't have the Skip and limit method anymore I need to do it manually by myself but it works but I do it by myself so now if I need to create a REST API on top of this completed stage well let's see how it look likes controller I think and okay I just want to show you okay so and then I get my completable stage you might tell okay pretty easy but what about ever only let's say now I would like to update something okay so now I would like to find something if I find it I'm happy I will use a mapping but if I don't find it I need to go and do some exception but if it's not there I need to create it if you feel there I need to update it and this is what it look like right so I think it's pretty nice pretty fun pretty fast but this is the kind of source code you are coding nice we love icing right okay so if I go back to my nice slide deck what did we see this is icing queries I put my parameter I bound I execute get my completed stage immediately I don't wait any more and only when the result is ready I get a notification for each page because each request is always page we always use paging in the cast on car driver so when the first place ready we get back with the result I think Ready Set and reappear yeah it's exactly what we would what we wanted only later small problem you might have seen it's pretty complex to handle I mean to execute and get all the result in the proper order this is what we call the callback hell so many nested calls so many complicated code and so yeah I think look pretty nice because now it's not blocking any more and we can scale the TRP but we introduced two new witness the first is the callback hell and the second is maintainability if you have a new nested call to put in that crazy source code what will you do it's pretty it's pretty hard to maintain so what will you do I'm pretty sure you guessed right we will do the reactive approach so what is reactive so reactive is based on specification the reactive manifesto you can find on writing manifesto ugh and so the purpose is to create some application data maintainable oh this is exactly what we want to do extensive you can add as many features as you want and rest responsive that mean it will always respond something in a predictable time frame so that mean if you get a lot a lot of load the application should be able to scale and this is the elastic part and if somebody goes wrong while the application should still be up and running and this is the resilient part so we can use some circuit breaker graceful degradation pattern but when you're using reactive stuff you need to under all that limit use case or all the error and to be able to be Ella elastic and resilient we need to reuse the well-known massage driven but then loose coupling I think accumulator all the things you know you're so okay so what how do i implement this reactive manifesto well somebody did that for us so there is a sip specification and it's called reactive stream so it has been released first release was 215 and it has been created by Netflix and pivotal pivotal and live band more or less and so we define two roles first the publisher that will emit some event and the subscriber I will subscribe to the publisher get back subscribe and start to get some requests and for each result I get a callback so now it's not a callback per pages or per result it's a callback for each single row some reference application in the Java world for active stream you notification for the uncomplete now to implement that stack I need to change little bit the way we expose the service because in the Springwood world if you don't provide a fully non-blocking application that you won't even start spring will told you or your endpoints rest seems to be blocking so I won't even start there is a single loop in reactive and if somebody blocking that loop every everybody is waiting so no wait anywhere so to export the service we move from spring web MVC to spring my flux which is also a pretty new framework created two years ago and we invoke that right cheap stuff using Spring Fling white flux new new classes and again do you need five ok so let's see what happened to our code so eclipse is this side ok so let's go to the reactive world so let's first use our repository low-level API ok so now we bind exactly the same as before and we use executive executor active and we don't get any completable future or complicates completion stage we get a reactive resin set which is the publisher of the reactive implementation we just so and so we will just create a flux from this rigid set and it will be a flux for reactive row and you get a notification for every single row in your results it and you know the good part of flux is behaving the same as a stream it got the same API the same method so now to be able to do Beijing and get items from offset a to of to the limit you can reuse the skip and it's not called limit it's called take and just like that directive framework will do all the things all the weights under the hood to be able to get the item you need it's not really waiting just accumulating to the result and get the mapper so that's it for the low-level API what about the controller let's go to the controller and here we go and you know what it's exactly the same controller as the the synchronous implementation now there is no more callback l you can just under that the same way as we did before using exception and no more callback l we just simply save map reuse the same Java lambda as we get used to do with the synchronous way see find all symbol there is absolutely nothing to do and we even reuse the same annotation get mapping any interactive and it's I think pretty nice right okay so when you use the reactive stack okay you put the parameter prepare statement bind that is the same when you bound you get first you know the reactive result set that we change into a flux we start to execute some requests just after doing the subscribe so week we secure Zurich does the query and get a row which is here a reactive row and we got a row for if in notification for every single role and once we're done we get enough result we just sent the uncomplete yeah so you might ask which framework will do we pick to implement the reactive pattern in the driver is it Alex Java is it reactor well not at all that attacked just rewrite we implement the reactive stream there is something called a TCK for test compliant get to know if your own application match with the reactive stream specification and that's it this is what exactly what we did so when you read a lot of data coming from kasama as you get a notification for every single record we can say oh my subscriber which is here my client cannot keep up with all the notification i pushed to him so I can tell - Cassandra well please slow down just to help the client to consume all the event hey you got an embedded back pressure mechanism which work on the read side and but on the right side unfortunately you cannot just ask your client just just send you a lot a lot a lot of even especially if you working on even sourcing model so eventually you will just get the default behavior of Java which is everything is fine until it failed so at the punished time you may get some exception overloaded exception but yeah you know guess on a scale so eventually if you eat the limit of Cassandra at a new node so now if the reactive stuff we not only we are simple on not blocking but we are scalable and mental able as you can see the code is very close from the sink way to implement and it's still I think in still fast but we didn't get rid of all the weaknesses again new appears first is is it are to debug because now if you do some unit test you will have to block or compare the result only when all the rial the role have been processed so you cannot stop in the middle of the call to say it's not working anymore you need to get all the result to do the comparison so you need to be aware to under all those use cases and the last threat is the overloading exception there is no back pressure when you write so eventually you can after overloaded exception but I just say in the beginning 3000 transaction per cpu per core now most of the machine of eight CPU is 20k transaction per second per core and you know most of configuration is 5 node so it is only it's about 100k per second which is already pretty pretty high for a basic use case right so about all the links this is the only photo you need to make tonight so a lot a lot of links so first is a github repo if you find all the source code so Gandhi status tax Academy Academy that's like calm when you find all the training to improve in Cassandra this is a new website again all new stuff we just launched at the beginning of the of these months it's called community that the last icon if you get any question on Cassandra Andalus tax go here asked question is free we are expert on SWA question and below YouTube channel twitch channel height which and download that as tax we also provided some labs and beta version of everything's new and everything's coming so you got that estat desktop you can install on your station you find the new version of that attacks graph and all new tools that's coming at the end of the year for our on Gia thank you question yep no no I will repeat the question yeah you are the callback for every single record in the object reactive result set it's a subscriber now because you you will process all the you know everything related to a record in the single callback why do you have called back of callback it's not the same as I think when you need to and they'll multiple thing you know when in I think you get a full page and depending on the page you can have multiple arrow and so depending on the error you get another callback so multiple branch in the same callback because in the callback you have multiple record but now on reactive you get a single record so you can't just decide it's true or fast correct or not exact exceptional not you still have you still have a callback which is hidden here it yeah it's now a flux it's not a computable feature but you know what you can just get a completable feature in java 8 and move it into a flex yeah but if you move from flux to complete compatible future you lose all the uncomplete stuff and all the nice pretty features you get with the flex but yeah you still have called back even more callbacks yeah it's it's not really as I mean so the old sequel statement have been created with the query builder in the common but something like that so everything has been initialized at the beginning so I now create something using serial identifier but just immutable and then for my statement I would just say query builder maybe this one is okay that Incept to reuse all the security denture filters to create my statement and get my prepare statement that was okay this one will generate so query builder insert will generate a sequel statement inserting - there is no notion of partition key when you insert into you need to be aware of your partition key and if you do not provide a partition key the insert statement it will fail in the create table yes here I create table so new statement create table and I will say with partition key and name Oh fine by oh it's just me which who knows it who know which is the partition key and I create the query accordingly because I know which is the query yeah we you know if I do find my ID it's me okay fine fine by symbol this is my I need to monitor this big I think this is great although I think I would break my head is like what's going on over here you know here yeah so this is my simple statement this is me but putting the where Clause because I know my magician key is part of these we're close but it's a good point in the object marker but which is I've just been released today if you look at the simple in the beginning of course it in the beginning then you just annotate your own titties here is a partition key so if you if you do that with the mapper then when you do the save and the insert by ID he knows oh by the way we got a issue here it's a face sample yeah we got here we we should have the UID here and get exactly the same but you will notice depending on the annotation how which is but it will generate exactly the same statement as we did explicitly using simple statement all right all right thank you I need to borrow your stuff okay I'm gonna borrow this and this yes and Wow is that cuz this our twitch setup is this what makes it work yeah is this all the magic right in here right in one box hey can I use your clicker to ceedric what did you say can I use your own akika yeah where is that I would give it to you what about the mic oh you already I already have one of those can I have your presentation yeah yeah yeah all right do one mic cool as well yeah can I use your car meet you presume yeah can you do the presentation all right what am I here for all right I can't move all right stay here yeah yeah apparently yeah I was really nervous I mean we have my laptop oh you can't see the data stacks logo got it all right yeah we can't have that all right so um welcome everyone what's that you it might not oh god no well you got like all these people helping you it's great you don't see this behind you but there's like five people back there oh all right she looked good everything's fine there all right we're good okay cuz you know I'm really worried about those 3,500 people are on Twitch right now it's amazing and welcome everyone from far-flung places I actually heard that the International Space Station is watching this right now yeah so a lot of people want to know about Cassandra in space why because it's the only database that will run in space and we're gonna prove that someday mark my words I have a plan and I've been trying to pull it I talked to her CMO about this I say look I have a crazy idea give me two million dollars trust me and she didn't say yes yet but I'm working on it I want to put some cube SATs in low-earth orbit all Network and they will work I want to put a cluster in space you know because Microsoft where they have cosmos DB whatever it runs on earth I'm gonna show terrestrial what is that no I want one in space and I'm pretty sure it will become the official database of SpaceX bluella be hard with Blue Origin Jeff Bezos will have to finally admit Cassandra's better than dynamo because he doesn't run in space all right I'm sure this talk has nothing to do with that just just giving you my dreams just letting you know who I am all right so how many of you are seeing some familiar faces but how many of you use Cassandra on a pretty regular basis you walked in and said oh you're here yeah well good there's a lot of not hands up there and so I'm gonna give you a pretty quick run-through now this is this is going to make you extremely dangerous with Cassandra data modeling but it'll give you a good overview of what you should know how you should understand a Cassandra data model and hopefully give you enough information that you can move on from there so let's let's start with where you begin everybody does this right I have yet to find out is anyone here not using relational data before it doesn't know anything about relational data modeling still no hands see this is going to be the case for a long time although I did get one hand at a university so they're like oh we never use a sequel oh wow it's starting to happen but we're not there yet so relational database five you know you have u5 normal for ins no one gets past three you have foreign keys you have joins this is what we build and when you build a tables you your joining them together you have your employees and your departments this is what we're used to doing and then you build these things whether it's gonna be our DS you know these things really well you've probably prayed to them as you wrote your application right because where's my data well you get the little crow's feet here you know that show like one-to-many relationship so entities and the relationships now that's SQL right no this is not SQL this is an entity relationship diagram so relational data modeling you take that ER D which isn't your physical data model it doesn't say anything about the SQL itself and you create an entity table you add constraints you put your index fields in there you add some foreign key relationships and this is I mean I was an Oracle DBA for fifteen years I did this in my sleep you know this is how we build those and that foreign key relationship is maintained so whenever you do a delete cascade and then you know the redo logs fill up and your DBA is call you and freak out but that's what this is for so you don't you wind up not creating problems the problem with all this linking and connecting and everything is this runs on one server right and it is pretty heavy acid compliance is hard and what I I think we've all learned to do is we take this domain of data and we create models from it and then we write our application and our application adheres to that data model here's what I'm I am ready to say this because I don't think a lot of people believe me I was just at the velocity conference but maybe you were there to assist in San Jose a couple weeks ago talking to folks about did you know and I'm gonna make you believe me by the end of this that almost every relational database use case can be moved to Cassandra oh I saw somebody's head don't walk out stay here I will prove it to you and this is even things like banking this is one of my favorites well banks would use relational database no they don't banks don't use relational databases for transaction management you know what they still use probably a mainframe or Cassandra so how does that work let me explain so Cassandra data modeling flips this data modeling scheme on its head you go from an application you I'm going to build an application you build the models to match that application and then eventually your data comes out of it and that is completely on its head from what I showed you before where you take that domain of data build your models then the application and this is what we call application based data modeling that is how you build data models for Cassandra so I'm gonna give you a quick example we have this reference application called killer video comm I would recommend you go check it out and the reason I think you should check it out is because it give you some nice there's a tour click on that button and it'll actually walk you through the application and show you the data models that are there to support the application that's kind of cool and it gives you some real world this is an actual running application and gets really read any wave Cassandra it's kind of like a YouTube cloned and you'll get to see some cat videos and everything we totally stole it from YouTube but that is just a simple system but you think about this is a system with entities that requires transactions that acquires you know all these things that a relational database typically would be used for that Cassandra can do really awesome you know what you else else you get with that is multi data centers hybrid cloud multiple clouds no problem active active active all the way across and this database is built to scale and replicate unlike that wonderful of the relational database that everyone seems to be still hug you know how Oracle scales right up until you run out of money alright so thank you my reps always hated me telling me that alright so building an application flows we're gonna start we're gonna do five steps here this is not Ted twelve step this is what five step building your application workflow step one now probably where most people most application developers get a little tweaked they're like hold on I don't know my application workflow you probably do so this workflow what am I talking about in the conceptualization phase when you're talking you're doing the whiteboarding you know the fun stuff you do with the product manager and the architects and the developers and we all get in a room and we have pins and we'd start marking on the board and there's this conceptualization phase like what are we building it's a part of our product or it is a product well during that moment and when you're doing that and you've probably all done it you've go through this thing where you mock-up pages and you start looking at how your application will work and things like user will log in there's a sign-in button up there these are all pretty common right but you'll learn things like oh user selects video these are parts of the application that I need to be able to support now what we build is this thing it's called an application workflow and it's very simple it's you don't just show the basic information about a user you just don't you can but it's not something you're gonna ask in an application you're gonna require a login first right you're so you're gonna have in-state you're gonna have who that user is samos showing about a video in its details either you're gonna click on a video with all it like an ID number on it or you're gonna do some sort of a search to find it so all that stuff is part of that workflow so you're not you're not seeing is like well I need to be able to write any random query I need at any point that's SQL where I'm gonna track all of the queries my application needs and build those so that's the next step modeling those queries now when you have a pretty decent workflow good but let's go back to this this is an entity relationship diagram of killer video and this should be really familiar this is the same thing entities user video comment those are all entities and I actually heard somebody tell me you can't do entity management with Cassandra I'm here to tell you that's all it does and these entities have relationships and they have properties this is what a database do you shouldn't be able to just dump JSON in it and expect for the best right let's model our database so how do we manage that look at some like I have requirements user logs and decide okay that was one of the things well the query that I'm going to map to that is find user by email address that's how I'm doing my user management how about comments show comments for a video find comment by the video or the idea of the video and I have a requirement that I want the latest first so there's a reverse order on cron on the timestamp so all of these things I'm starting to pick through and now I have a pretty good idea of what my data model should look like now I'll pause you for a minute there are some that require a little more finesse or a little different type of data model for instance something that is more like an index like five video by tag now normally in a relational database I would maybe index the tag field it but if it's a collection that's gonna be really hard I probably have to add some sort of a search mechanism to it well in this case I'm actually creating a physical table on the filesystem on the database that will index all my tax like you know the cat funny laughable all those different things that you have we tagged videos so I'm gonna walk through these and how now we're ready to actually make a table making that table is going to be somewhat familiar so you take the users that's you and how you name those and this is this is my personal naming scheme but one that I hope many of you will adopt which is entities to give them a single name user comment video and then we have these relationships that we also create tables for the relationship that's a big one we create tables to build the relationships it's not a foreign key like a join now this table is actually the joint so in this case find comments by user so I'm gonna give these some very descriptive descriptive names and I'll show you in a minute what those look like now static table I want to find video by ID well here's videos table and I say this should look familiar because it's a create table this does look a little bit like SQL so you have a table name some column names you have data types to call it's a cql data type cql data types are cql cassandra query language data types are very important they do a lot of things first of all they marshal the data so if I say UUID and I throw a number at it it will it should bounce it shouldn't allow that it didn't force the schema but also it does things like does sort order if I need that it maintains that sort order now what it doesn't do and you'll notice like varchar' doesn't have a size on it you know how many of you can type varchar' 255 in your sleep you know well it doesn't allocate size and that means that you have a lot of flexibility when it comes to storage the storage actually is two gigs per column don't do that that will ruin your application trying to stream two gigs of data from your application to the database you'll your network people will find a place for you to be buried that would be really mean but you do have some flexibility you're not going to get capped on size but that means the data that you put into your database is what you actually that's the storage requirement whenever you do a create table in Oracle for instance you it allocates the space on disk same with my sequel all the relational databases because it's a random access file you have to create the segment on disk and this as you're writing data it starts using disk and that's that's really easy for scaling and that helps you you could do scaling exercises very easily by just looking at the data types and what you're gonna store in the database and do some simple math now finally we have the primary key designation and this I will argue is the most important part of the data model this is the part that I really want you to take away tonight and say aha I will make sure I know how to use a primary key primary key has the same use as a relational database it is it says this record is unique based on that primary key in this case it's this one thing we call a partition key called video ID so this is a single ID lookup table I will Pat I will say select from this table where video I equals whatever that UUID is and I will get that entity back that's what this table is for now a more dynamic table is something like fine video by tag well this create table of videos by tag aha now that's a little more interesting because now we our primary key is gonna change and as I said the primary key is probably the most important part of this here's why because it's not just a single partition key lookup I'm not looking up just the tag I'm also including the video ID now any the first item in a primary key is called a partition key every other column that you add into it is called a clustering column you could think of this as a way with a partition key is used to to allocate like where it is in the cluster and the clustering columns allocate the storage there they denote the storage will go into this but this dynamic table then allows you to store all of the video IDs for that one single tag on one file on your disk but ultimately and it makes for a very fast lookup these are millisecond lookups at this point so whenever I do users I have these two things going on here like for instance I'm gonna find the user my email address in the user credentials table and then as part of my application workflow and this is just to demonstrate the workflow the next step in my application is I will take that ID that's returned from this table and then do a look-up on users when I display the next page so mobile application web application I hope no one is making CICS applications anymore that would be terrible but those are typical you have a workflow with your user right with your user user interface now number four get the primary key right I said it was the most important thing here's how I'm going to prove it primary key again that part of your table declaration which denotes this is going to be a this is a unique part of a record that first part is a partition key the partition key has a very important job and now since we are now we're no longer talking about a single server good that means you no longer have a single point of failure now using a distributed system all right now you have to understand distributed systems work and this is the as much distributed systems I'm gonna give you tonight but it is a pretty cool topic I have a whole degree in it but the idea of distributed systems is that you have locality of data that it's you have multiple systems but you want them to act as one so when we create a cluster of say a thousand nodes and yes there are a thousand node clusters out there in the wild some of us here work at that place I'm not gonna point out names anyway when we have a thousand node cluster you run into two problems first of all you're running a thousand nodes second thing is where's my data now if you were looking for select name description from videos with that UUID and yes that's a UUID what are you gonna do with that now if you're looking at this cluster and every single node a full cluster scan really sucks okay that's a spark job that may run overnight so thousand nodes no the partition key which is required in a select what it does is it it gets tokenized it gets hashed into a consistent hash and that actually is mapped to a single node and it's replicas so that partition key is really critical for finding where that data is so in a thousand node cluster that video ID that record only exists on three nodes because we have a replication factor of three if you have a replication factor four then it'll exist on four nodes and that's it it is like it's like the address of your data on that cluster and this is what makes for fast data models the dynamic part of this adds a little more to it so I have a partition key tag so if I'm looking for cat videos those are probably gonna be listed on one node so that gives me a locality but then I have the video ID which is something that I want to show like a whole string of now let me show you how this would work so the partition key and the clustering column the partition key would be like a tag would be data model but the clustering column is that record after the partition key this is how it how its stored on disk but this is all a logical arrangement in the storage system why did we have it like this is because we want to do fast look ups on partition data and it so use a partition key to find out where the data is and you're in your cluster you use the clustering column to create order now I need to change this example because you you idea is not sortable really it is but it isn't but think of that something like a date or a number dates are really popular if you're doing an IOT application for instance being able to create a partition key let's say like a device number this is very common in fraud detection and the clustering column would be the date stamp of the data that you got from it and you could change the order on disk making ascending or descending that makes for some really fast data models all right finally now that we've left we've departed from primary key and primary key there's a lot more to say about it but right now we're just gonna move on to something that's also pretty critical is using data types effectively this is one of my favorite things that when people talk about oh no sequel database no schema right on I can do whatever I want wrong they're a schema in Cassandra and you have to adhere to it and it has type typed databases are awesome and data types do two things like I said they do data marshalling hey is this the right data type I'm making I'm enforcing the schema to my application our drivers all enforce that as well get strings that string all of that is baked in from top to bottom so now this is good for the DBA is this is good for architects is good for developers because everyone agrees this will be a string or this is an int now the order controlling is probably the thing that that's where you get into some really cool like ninja skills when you're like you can really do some cool stuff with ordering and clustering comps and the ordering is controlled by the types so I move on the ordering these are ones that are really typically used for order like int obviously you want a new numerical ascending descending day time stamp now tiny UID very special data type which is does two things first of all it's a UID which is a universally unique ID number which is guaranteed to be a a unique number in the universe it's kind of in the name but I'm sure there's plenty of people who argue with me but anyway it's meant to be a random number hash that is going to be unique but it adds a timestamp as part of it and that's pretty cool because whenever you're doing something like really high resolution IOT and there's a potential where you have two timestamps that will intersect there is the way that Cassandra works on inserts is that if you're trying to match like your primary key includes a timestamp use a time UUID if you have high resolution why because if you're using a primary key and there it's to exact same data points that you're the exact same value it will overwrite the previous value as a feature you could turn that off but now you're you're affecting your speed more than likely you just want to store both values time you ideally like to use the exact same time stamp with a UUID component attached to it which gives you that randomness and you get both of them now time UUID since it has a timestamp in it also has a comparable so it allows for sorting so when you'd say select and you want to sort on time UID it will do it in time order and that is that is one of those things that will save your life if you're doing IOT banking loves time UID they never lose data and so just keep that in mind we really try to map like directly to Java types and there are some special ones but like for instance decimal goes to big decimal float double big integer we try to map as much to the Java driver as a first-class citizen but there's also special typing that goes into Python C++ and then finally collections these are these are ones that can get you in trouble because I'll give you an example but first of all you have three different collection types you have set list and map set is I went to the data that I put it in the order it goes in is the order that it'll stay in so or I'm sorry by the ordering of the of the type so if I say it's set of our chart it will do alpha order in the set if I do a set of int it'll do in order entered your order inside of the set list I get a control the order that's a little heavier of operation and then map is just a key value and again you have cql type for the key and a cql value for a type for the tight and for the hub key and the value but here's what you don't want to do and this is you can nest types you don't want to create a database in your database and i've seen this happen before was like oh I have a map now I could build a database like a key value store inside of a Cassandra partition there is a limit first of all of how many map objects you can have you can have 65,000 of them that sounds like a really familiar number I'm sure it's actually 65,536 and that's a limit for a reason because every time you read a map it has to read the entire thing off a disk so that's a huge hit it doesn't do incremental reads of maps that may change in the in the future if you don't like it I think a juror would be awesome remember this is an open source project or a contribution yeah we'll see all right maybe one of the 3,500 people watching on twitch I'm looking at you all right so the map though is really a useful it is a dynamic part of your data model inside your data model and it is useful up to that limit of course but you can create a list of maps and you can do collections or collections so there's some really cool things you can do with it it's a dynamic part of more of static data model and that is the beauty of it it is built for a reason it does give you some of that dynamic dynamism so for instance with set I may have a set of different images for a video like thumbnails for a video or something like that I think that's what I actually did here preview thumbnails weren't math sorry the tags I had a set for tags and so it gives you some really flexible stuff in your data model alright so what are you gonna do now since everyone here except for you has never used Cassander before how do you get it use it well we got a few choices if you want to just go the open-source route go to patchy or Cassandra dot Apache org download the tarball you can download trunk which is pretty cool that's for dodo trunk which is not released yet so we would love to hear your feedback on it or run the 3x trunk if you want to if you need open you like open source but you just want support we have that available at data stacks it's called um Davis X distribution or Patrick's and ER it's a support package we have different levels of support like really will call you sometimes support all the way up to I want critical support on my open source systems and then finally when you want all the bells and whistles of an enterprise database including security and auditing and a lot of really cool backup tools and operations and it's a very enterprising product Davis tax Enterprise so we give you the full range now you may have heard it made me not that we are we have announced the product called constellation and constellation is our cloud product and part of it is this thing called Cassandra's a service so we have signups going right now you can go to was it what's the URL constellation that I know constellation out Davis tax calm and you can sign up get in there check it out and we will let you know when we have openings for it where we're gonna be releasing that soon but this is just stuff to look for that's coming we're really excited about that part of it because as most of you are probably aware running a database kind of sucks unless you are the person who gets paid to do that and then it's awesome and then there's one other piece I think also there is docker images available too and I forgot to mention that so there are lots of ways to do this if you want to know more and you want to get more information like this like I said this is five steps but there's way more to this go to Academy data stacks comm we have tons of resources all free e-learning you can see me and David and a few other people up there talking about how to build really good data models and there's a whole course on data modeling there's a whole course on operations all parts of like our operations product ops center all that's online it's for free you can go check it out so I think that's all I had you have all the resources you need now questions yes yes right strong you get strong consistency with Cassandra what what I think the myth of the bank use case is that you need commits rollback and that you need to do strong transactions where you say I'm gonna change these two accounts and then do a commit no bank ever does that and why you can look at the back wall we have a lot of banking customers and there I'll put all their transactional critical path is probably running on Cassandra why is that banks don't need to have a trend they probably wouldn't even trust the transaction at that level because it if it fails and MVCC does fail then how do you unravel it and it creates a lot of redo and what banks have done since the beginning is banks computing on banks started with mainframes right what they do is they have this there's a data model called ledger data model so what you're doing is you're tracking every single thing that happens every transaction as like a flight recorder so if you're say moving money from one account to another transaction one remove money from account transaction to add money to account transaction three update balance and that is that's a series of transactions and if something happens in the middle then you can go back and replay it and this is how we built a lot of systems around this and it is kind of like a redo log but banks don't want to lose any data they're not going to lose the money they don't move money but they don't want to lose data so just making discreet transactions in there now blow that up into all kinds of different use cases for instance if someone like your Bitcoin transactions I've seen a couple of those use cases are pretty cool Monza bank I don't know if you've heard of them at all internet bank 100% Cassandra no relational databases to be seen why because they have a bigger problem they need to be in multiple data centers active-active they need to be international so they need to have their data geo-located if mons oh the small internet bank went to a big company like IBM Oracle and said we want to set this up they couldn't be a start-up it just wouldn't work because they couldn't afford the kind of systems and even that it wouldn't even match what they need so that's why I'm pretty confident in saying that and I that's the kind of thing that we try to like get you thinking about is what is that real transaction it's easy to do a commit rollback but is that really what you need sorry long-winded answer but I thank you for asking the question other questions yeah excellent couple of questions that I could tell you where you were paying attention so first of all for every query you're going to have a table that seems like you're gonna have a lot of tables yes more than likely it depends on how big your application is but having you know tens or hundreds of tables is not uncommon but you want to think of it actually there's a good way of thinking about is like a materialized view your denormalizing every single data bit into a single table you may have data duplication you will have applications that support various parts your app tables that support various parts your application which there may be many but what you're doing is you're really optimizing the database in the application together so whatever you create new features you just add a new table this is how companies like Netflix stay online a hundred percent of the time and they keep adding features because they do these ad stuff where they can add things to the database and migrate data over real time and then have that feature online immediately without having to go through like alter table you know that do that on a big database a member of Facebook did an altar table on one of their schemas that took over a month to change and so they're scale brings new problems right second question you had is what's a good partition key and I really love that question there's a couple of ways to do it so a UID is always a good choice for a lot of reasons it's easy for drivers to or any language can generate a UUID Java Python any language so that that is not a Cassandra thing it's a it's just a part of software engineering but a lot of times I what I try to look for is a natural key something that for instance on that user lookup table the the email address I know that that should be unique and I'm going to enforce that uniqueness now here's a maybe a little side subject on that but if I'm gonna have an email address and Cassandra will overwrite my data if I do an insert on that doesn't that sound dangerous well there is a there is a way to do this and this is to the strong consistency there is a we have this thing called lightweight transactions that do an exclusive right to the database but also do consistent checks so you could say insert into and it will with that insert into with that email or that email address and when you do that it will lock the database lock that row look at the lookup on that row first of all see if it exists if it doesn't exist it'll make sure it's the exclusive writer write the database write the data to the table and then release the lock if that data exists already and this is the the key phrase and that insert only if not exists if it exists it'll turn it back to the user saying I'm sorry this row already exists and reject it so we have mechanisms inside of it to maintain a really strong consistency but something like an email address which is almost be unique use that as a primary key now a little more advanced would be maybe using something like what I call composite keys which is a combination of two things as a partition key if you use two different items like for instance if you have a device ID and and I'm here that you want to use is your partition key put parentheses around it and that that can makes those two items a single partition key so these are like some of the things you'll learn that we have a course on online called ds2 20 is practical data modeling it goes through a lot of this stuff but this is where you you can get some really cool skills and impress your friends make make all your co-workers totally jealous because you know what you're doing but that primary key like I mentioned that's the most important part you get that primary key right you've got a great data model yeah right I really wish I could say yes but it's a very you're you're going from a normal form multiple dorm room form database to a fully do normalize database so no is the answer and some of the things that I let me explain some of the parts that make make didn't answer know a little more palatable is whenever you have a fully normalized database third normal form second normal form the important part is the queries that you're running against it at that point so what in order to migrate data you would have to be watching every single query on the database so I would if I was migrating data from a relational database to Cassandra I'd be a way more interested in a list of SQL queries the Select queries you do versus the tables themselves you see why yeah and so that's that's one thing also when you're building a distributed a new application based on a distributed database you really do want to start rethinking some things what would I tell you like Aurora you're right it's pretty much Postgres right and of course it's gonna you could migrate it over because it's a relational database but what if I said hey you have to run yeah on your on-premise data center like sabbath's around the corner and oh we also need to run in Azure at the same time with two with the same database you got very little choice at that point and this is actually where a lot of Cassandra users are right now is running in two different data centers that are like one's a cloud and ones of my aunt Prem we're migrating or sky who's one of the logos back there they run in Google Amazon and on Prem I active active active and they have this there's a common micro services tier in each one and they all access the same data which is fully replicated those three data centers so this is the kind of reality we're working with and then how do you migrate your relational data into that you're gonna rebuild a lot of stuff yeah anybody else all right well thank you very much I appreciate you being here [Applause] goodbye everyone from twitch 16 yeah when I thought there might have been somebody from the Space Shuttle or the International Space Station you",
