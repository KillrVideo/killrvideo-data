  "description": "I wanted to see what it's like to use ChatGPT to query my database so I built a chatbot and you won't believe what happened!\nI used OpenAI's APIs to create embeddings of my data and stored them in Astra. Then ran a vector search and fed it into a ChatGPT prompt to get an answer.\nWith just a few lines of code, I've built an AI chatbot with ChatGPT and Astra, powered by Cassandra vector database!\nIf you'd like to know more, check out Ania Kubów's video on vector embeddings -- https://dtsx.io/3Pj5dTq.",
