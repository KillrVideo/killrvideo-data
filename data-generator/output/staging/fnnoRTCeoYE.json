    "text": "how fast can you architect a gen app well let's find out I have this whole thing planned out and I'm going to show you how to do this it's really simple let's start here this is a product specification for an app that I want to write this may be something that you're interested in in this case I have a bunch of order database stuff going on in my Cassandra database I have customers already using it it's an app that was built a long time ago this is like an e-commerce app but as many meetings are probably being had even in your place hey how do we do gen with the data we got this is a spec around that we take our customer data their order data and give them a self-service aspect like chat with it they can do some self-service look at what's happened that sort of thing but all natural language so chat you type stuff in it'll answer questions for you and it's using the existing data that you have in cassander already check out this spec it has a lot of stuff in here this is pretty typical of what you can see it's like here's what we wanted to do here's all the features it has this like automated customer service order history some of the technology it's like hey we want to do it this way this is soap high in the sky it's like we're going to use state-ofthe-art AI we are going to use state-of-the-art AI but when you have this spec this is cool this is what everyone agrees like yeah this is what we want we want to have a user interface and then here's the benefits metrics now the important thing on this is that it also goes through the existing tables for customer and purchase data now you may have some of these in your database but in this case I I just made this up but this is pretty typical because I've built about a 100 of these and you have a customer table you have the orders and then you have the order items and all of these are have primary keys they have columns that have data denormalized data in it pretty typical cassander table now I want to use that data for my chat application okay so how are we going to do that H we're going to use some AI to make some AI if you've never done this before I'm going to blow your mind if you have well maybe not so much but it's still really cool I do this all the time now so take a look at what I put at the top here I'm going to use this product spec and I'm putting a prompt in the front and for this prompt I'm using chat GPT now you can use anything you want you can use Gemini you can use claw it's not important I think there's different levels of quality this is why I'm using chat GP I like using GPT 4 because it's pretty high quality when it comes to this kind of stuff Cloud 3 is pretty good right now too as of check the date stamp on the video that day right so it will probably change pretty soon so just always look for like what's the latest what's good for this sort of thing where you're looking for architecture chat code generation that sort of thing what I have here at the top you know you are a generative AI consultant that helps company build applications we're giving it a role we're saying this is who you are old large language model and it gives it some direction to move with okay after that we have this is what I want you to do I want to build an application in the text below I would like your help on creating the architecture we're using python as a backend react on the frontend in a chat window details on how to properly architect this application this includes what llm to use and how to integrate L chain so we're getting a little specific here but we want some help on that here's a product specification boom so what I'm going to do super simple I'm just going to copy the entire thing and I'm taking it over to my old friend Chad GPT and if you don't use chat GPT for this sort of thing you are missing out remember the whole point of generative Ai and this is what we're building for our customers but what you should use it as well is to make you more lazy it's okay to say that we want to be more lazy because we don't have to work as hard to get more productivity it should increase our productivity and this is a great opportunity for us to increase our productivity with this particular application so I'm G to move my bubble over here and I'm going to take that message that I copied out of that dock this is a it's great to use a dock for something like this because then you can play with the prompt you can add some details that sort of thing it's just a scratch Pad but I just copy the whole thing now I'm pasting the whole thing and I'm hitting go and let's see what it comes up with now of course because chat GPT it's going to start off with like oh we're going to you know have we're going to build this Acme product chat requires careful consideration thank you chat gbt but it starts getting into it it's like hey here's some options here are some things generative AI models um like maybe you should of course it's like you know what you should use gp4 because that's me of course and we could ask it different questions but it's giving it giving us a lot of details now and the best part about this is that this isn't just the end of course this is all very useful information but we can start tweaking on this quite a bit um for instance uh as when it's finished up and O it throws out security and privacy considerations this is all good stuff right and it's how you can start taking your product spec and building out an actual application so I can ask a question like uh what about using Sanic instead of fast API so I can ask that question so it's it's like sure you want to do that go for it um of course it's not I rarely find that chat TBT is like um would you want to do that I don't think so we should probably play around with that that' be a fun thing to test out but it gives you some advantages you can work through it because this has all been trained on pretty recent data most of the stuff that it's giving you is going to be pretty up to date I think I think it was as of like last September or last October or something like that so that's this is recent news and information thank you very much for chat GPT doing this what about specifics I want to get API endpoints I'm gonna ask it hey how about some specific ones and it's gonna do it now it's not the ones that I absolutely have to do I don't have to go out and create these exact things but these are a great way to springboard I'm doing the brainstorming right now I can continue I can refine I can even take it to other people and see what they think kind of a cool setup here because now it's getting a lot of my work done I don't have to go and type any of this stuff I can copy and paste it edit it modify it do whatever I need to do but I'm going to have some fun with this um what if you know and what if we ask it to do something really stupid I'm going to say can we do this using Pearl and um it's possible of course this is It's really excited about using Pearl okay maybe that's a bad example point being is that if you want to do something stupid chat GPT is here to help you but we want to weigh this out and so maybe this is a better question to ask and I'm just giving you some examples of how this should work and I think this is a a wonderful way to just I mean from just sitting here I've done this on my laptop a few times where I've I've jumped up a couple of things used chatting BT to throw out some ideas refine it do some compare and contrast and it's really been helpful mostly to helps refine my thinking when I'm working through it like an application idea or something that's a little it's not fully formed in my head this is a good place to go because if anything it helps you refine what you're thinking and articulate what you want now this is great because I said I want to use Pearl and it totally supported me on this so what Pearl or python I asked a question I got a very detailed answer but you know think about this in terms of how you architect your applications in your environment in your world with your people you know there's going to be those moments where somebody says Hey I want to do it this way and I want to or I want to do it that way maybe you have some folks who really like rust and you have some folks like go and they're going to have at it this is a good way to weigh those two things out hey if you want to use go or rust here's the pros and cons now I use Python and pearl in chat GPT was very happy to tell me the difference and can you know the contrasting and give me some ideas around that cool but in your world you may find this actually helpful because we don't just have these monolithics now I know some of you only use spring Java great but what if you don't there's going to be some band of developers that are only going to want to use go for for instance this is helpful you can build out your documentation and architecture and this should work I hope this helps",
