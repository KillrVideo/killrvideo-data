    "text": "yeah my name is raghavan srinivas but i go by rags i'm work as a developer advocate at data stacks i've been doing you know nosql for a long time obviously you know done relational databases as well for a long time uh basically i um i've worked as a developer advocate um you know doing uh java kind of more of the application development the inner loop and so on and and i love this group because our main mission is to level up your skill no matter where you are uh you know whether you're a um you know really a beginner or a experienced person and hopefully we can talk to you about uh kate sandra and share the passion that we have because like i said before i think it's a great match for nosql and um you know kubernetes to come together and you will see that in action today by trying it out yourself so that was a brief brief introduction for myself right and i want to keep my hand even i want to keep my introduction even shorter i'm developer advocate and data stacks we do a lot for cassandra case android stargate and many other technologies we like we work with but most of all for developers who are interested in these technologies now let's move on uh that's not only two of us behind this workshop but there is plenty of people who invested themselves a lot into that and put many effort into developing software and develop a workshop and develop everything what we are using uh for that workshop and many others and on our stream uh on our youtube channel we have at least two workshops per week so we will be happy to see you joining datastax developers on youtube now a little bit of housekeeping and setup so we have a pretty huge program today and we will see what's going on to happen a lot first of all for this workshop we provide a special certificate of completion or we call it achievement unlocked page if you follow this workshop with us you have to watch the video live or record it ask your questions do the practical steps make the screenshots of those steps and submit them at github.com kids under workshop in the wiki you will have a link on how do you submit that okay now things you need to know first uh link most important link for us today is github.com kate sandro workshop and uh you have a kate sandra community discord thing and we suggest you to join community at kate sandro dot io and of course twitter kate sandra kate sandra is a big thing and i hope in the end you will like it as much as we do and for today we have multiple installation options so you can prefer the one you like the most local cloud and installation uh first of all local installation is for any kind of a development purposes are you using kubernetes in docker good are you using mini cube also good whatever you like uh that's great then for today uh we also see yeah just a little bit to add alex there um you know there are quite a few options here uh and and pretty much we have we have tested the instructions for for most of it um you know steve kind of straddles the tool so even though it's on the cloud we have made it more of a local install because the idea is that you know you can effectively use it as like a local cluster but there are some options uh where you can connect and you will see that today in action uh where you can deploy an application and essentially uh access it uh like like it was um you know in the um in the cloud or something so so see what kind of straddles that uh there are there are some issues with traffic right now uh and that's why it's not going to work in a in a cloud mode but but um you know traffic is being worked on and then you know you can you can kind of use it like like a gke or eks or aks uh but but for now you know these instructions are gonna work on pretty much uh kind mini cube or uh you know whatever you choose yep okay uh good then uh maybe you will proceed from this point if you're ready rex so let's go to the next slide ah okay uh you just can start okay i can do it yeah sure yeah oh would you like to share my screen alex is that the easy if you wish yeah we are in zoom so you can just start sharing let me do that that might be the easiest and meanwhile there is a question in chat a good question i want to mention if is is this workshop suitable for beginners and my answer is it very depends on your definition of a beginner we do recommend it to people with at least some kubernetes knowledge i would say yeah well we've kind of um you know prepared the workshop in a way that uh you could you could get started uh we you know most most most of you will probably be familiar with cube cuddle um using the cube cuddle command so um you know uh if you if you know that then you're probably good uh and by the way can you see my screen alex i can see you but i cannot see your screen so far let me see if i can all right oh yeah that looks better all right so let's so the first thing you would probably do is kind of figure out where you're going to install kate sandra um you know whether you want to do it uh and and thanks to civo we have a link where you can you can get a kubernetes cluster pretty much in in a couple of minutes i've already created one um and and you can use that uh this is available only till uh a couple of days um or maybe you know it will go away in a in a couple of days so so um you know just just keep that in the back of your mind uh if you're if you want to use this infrastructure yes okay um i think this pretty much you know uh talked about what what we uh said before which is basically you can use the local install or the c1 instance or you can use a cloud instance if you have uh um you know a way to stand this up either in gke or eks or and and really all that you're gonna do is you know you'll see uh we'll just follow the steps outlined in the workshop uh there is one step that you know we need to uh you know remind you a couple of times uh it's it's called out in the workshop pretty explicitly but but just want to make you aware that you may want to replace this ur address especially if you're using a datastax provided vm but if you're using cevo you don't really need to do that but once again you know traffic is working traffic is kind of the ingress so we're going to ignore the ingress part today for for sevo but but you know if you want to set that up later you can do that and you're going to pretty much follow the same steps as you were going to set up you know if you're going to do the data stacks vm so so maybe it's left as an exercise to the reader so you can try this out um later but uh but for sleevo uh you don't need to replace this ur address there are different yaml files and as you walk through the workshop i'll i'll uh you know we can we can take it uh look at that are we ready to jump into minty which is really our cool part right yeah good so uh we are ready to jump to main team yeah and you may want to shave your screen alex right yeah yeah sure i know i just uh want to check what you are ready to switch to maintain so what is the mentee and what's going on take a look uh we use mentee for two purposes first one you know what you can ask us questions that is fair but without mention we cannot ask you questions that's not fair so first we use menti to ask you the questions and understand what's going on like what are your primary topics what should we focus on and so on you will see in a moment but second in the most interesting is we use manti to play a game and the end of this workshop and in the end of this workshop you can play game with us uh answer questions if you do it fast enough and if you give for right answers you will get prizes from data stacks so first for now it's not the quiz it's not a competition but just the setup part so you can start using 20 make yourself familiar with it and you will know how it works it's very easy you just go to mention.com and enter the code 42541711 or just scan the qr code on the shared screen and then you will be in one more time please go to mendy.com four two five four one seven one one um you don't have to do it but if you don't do it you cannot participate in the game in the end of this workshop so i do ask you to join if there are not too many people join the mentee there will be no real competition and we love real competition on our games so we want to be there a lot of people with everyone having a chance to win the prizes and we go with the first questions uh that's not yet do not rush that's not yet uh that means how much experience do you have with kubernetes okay so i see there is someone who never have heard about that welcome to kubecon that's a conference dedicated to kubernetes you are going to have a lot of things to learn here and i see most of the people known but never use it use it once or two or even some people use regularly and hey we have some kubernetes experts that is great uh good so okay that makes us understand like what about you and well if you never have heard about that that's going to be a rough ride for you by the way if you are interested in docker and kubernetes we have a special workshop series on docker and kubernetes you may find on our youtube channel datastax developers how many cubecons you have attended before have you attended many first one that makes sense and welcome one or two three to five hey we have some uh people with a real experience here but for most of you that's the first one our congratulations we love this workshop and we are happy to see you here in person we probably didn't right for well not for the last couple of years at least and we have no no no we don't have many questions have you attended live or virtual sure uh so you can ask in chat but not on the team good now very curious where are you this time it's north america cubecon but because of this ability to attend virtually you can be from basically every part of the world and looks like we have people from nearly everywhere everyone from australia or australia is uh sleeping already very cool to see darts all around the world right it's so cool yes yes yes that's amazing and we have people from indeed from all around the world yeah hey cairo here i see brazil i see some part of staubern uh i'm south america but i'm not sure if it's chile what what's that you know island is that indonesia on top of australia [Music] that must be i'm not sure what is it exactly yeah i'm curious yeah that is interesting brighton in the chat it's indonesia mostly probably i think so filipinos filipinos yes it is indonesia and philippines okay right that may very much makes the sense like that's quite a global audience very well you know what don't worry about the prices we ship worldwide we may expect some delays with delivery but in the end you will get your price if you finish in the top free now we are going to harder points how much experience you have with apache cassandra too difficult but never use it practical experience hey is it a database at all basic understanding and or experience cassandra expert hey is it cedric in the chat good so cassandra is one of the best and most powerful technologies in the nosql world so today we will make you familiar with that then prometheus does it sound anyhow to you have you heard anything about the prometheus in the context of kubecon okay we have people who has a real experience with primitives or daily usage some people give some experience some think about monitoring never use it uh good of fire well yes but no not today day for you prometheus is not a god of fire but the monitoring all while not only monitoring but the two we will use to understand and keep under control our databases on kubernetes grafana does it sound to you anyhow have you heard about that i know how it works i know it but i never used it never heard of it that is good as well so it looks like for some people we have a lot of things of new things to cover today good you have a few grafana experts which is nice yeah well grafana is a kinda industry standard yes so that's not a big surprise and many people say grafana is a monitoring tool that is wrong grafana is data visualization tool so you can use it for monitoring but it can offer you so much more i like rafanam so operations or development are you more into the operations administration or are you more into the development or you stay on the both sides which is also very a lot so no surprises devops or operations mostly kubecon was mostly for those sites so this distribution makes really a lot of sense and as most of you have voted already and we have to move on uh are you going to use that deployment on your uh own uh local laptop or are you going to use cloud training instance okay like almost to 5050 that is interesting that's what we're thinking right so yeah yeah yeah you know what on previous cube cons it was different now more and more people tend to to use their laptops and like a couple of workshops ago it was not close to 50 50. it was very much for cloud training instance interesting okay but we support whatever you decide we support you in any of your choices and finally are you certified cassandra developer or administrator i know [Music] that most of the answer will be for nope but if there are any i will i would like to know about that as well so looks like most of you are not certified for that and that means what for currently 68 people have answered and still counting oh yeah we have one certified congrats well done so we have a great news for everyone who is not certified for apache cassandra as a developer or administrator data stocks sponsors your education and certification for apache cassandra to become a certified passenger developer or administrator that means what you can pass our courses online for free and they take an exam online for free and become a certified cassandra developer or administrator completely free of church thanks data stocks i love my job actually so if you want to be better in the powerful nosql world they have a very good news to you so we will explain it a bit later in the last part of the workshop now let's proceed so thank you so alex do you want to yeah you want to remind the attendees that this was just a practice because later we will come up with the real questions right the technical questions right right so right so now you've kind of you know got your muscle memory ready um you know you'll you'll have fun later as well because there are a couple more opportunities to kind of participate this participate in this the the uh the thing is not only do you need to get it right but you also need to be fast right and that that is kind of hard um you know especially for me i know i have i have trouble being fast but um but you know just keep this in mind now that you're used to it uh we will have uh one more you know later in the workshop right so uh yes but that was my very next phrase keep this window open we have a quiz in the end of the workshop so then that will be a real competition with real prizes perfect but that's enough for now and we can proceed and we go we've uh basically a story of the databases on kubernetes not story like history but a story like something what's going on and what you need to know to understand what are we focusing today at this workshop so cloud application architecture from a very very very high level we basically can split into three simple parts applications data and infrastructure so application is there not necessarily microservices it still can be a monolith and it may be good what it's wanted not everything should be reworked into microservices but anyway whatever they're using it they we're going to work with the data we're going to persist with data on this so it's not lost we are going to stream survey some data in case we need event streaming and we are going to analyze some data pretty much often and finally it's all going to be running on some infrastructure consuming compute networks and the storage very free layers it started then with monolithic applications using databases then it started it wasn't legacy database for sure for sure running usually on your own on-premises data centers um you all know that that was a traditional approach uh very familiar to many of you now then uh people realize it what modern world first of all clouds with all of their powers and micro services may be much better fit for the many many many cases but you know what you can adjust say a magical world a word and uh transfer your monolith into multiple microservices to modern purpose build databases to the cloud using databases as a service using cloud infrastructure as a service usually doesn't happen like that so migration started and many companies using hybrid cloud already it means what they still have their own on-premises data centers they still use those databases they use it to use for dozens of years and still you have these monoliths but new services are being developed usually as microservices often and running on the cloud already uh having this hybrid cloud not because it's a perfect solution for them but just because you cannot migrate a huge major application within single clicks it's not so easy and of course here we started to speak for the modern parts already for purpose-built databases about databases as a service both are getting more and more common and well-known nowadays and of course it was actively using benefits of cloud infrastructure as a service um and then finally docker kubernetes and containers have come actually containers work with us for a long long time but before doctor times there were no simple and convenient way to use them and uh kubernetes sorry docker became like the number one thing what provided a convenient way to use originally lxc linux containers and then they changed low-level engine to support some more things and here came the kubernetes kubernetes was originally developed by google to solve google level problems but when many many companies realized what they cannot now live without containers and if you want to manage containers on the real scale on production you have to go with kubernetes there were a docker swarm we started those times but actually it was it was too late docker swarm at this moment at that moment was not delivering any it wasn't just ready let me say so i was exactly doing research for my company it should go with docker swarm or kubernetes some years ago and kubernetes was the obvious choice and then many companies decided let's run it all ourselves in kubernetes and many companies many projects many people uh went for it and finally found out what actually it gives a lot of benefits but also there are some downsides they have to consider and still using cloud or self-managed infrastructure as a service doesn't matter if it's an open stack or i don't know amazon web services for example but still having kubernetes engine uh above having uh databases already above that or outside of kubernetes but still close to it and microservices running on top of it but never using databases as a service and focus it to keep full control over the databases and the point is a database layer is not easy and there is a lot of operations and a lot of things to do and in the last years more and more companies start to think of using databases as services basically using the same approach in running their applications running their microservices uh as a kubernetes spots but uh also having using already more software as a service database as a service simplifying their work because it gave them more time to take care of what they want to focus on instead of just running operations if you have experience on running operations on for any kind of a distributed database on your own you know exactly what i mean there is really a lot of things to do now what was uh what's the current state of these paths after the clouds path to them microservices and uh kubernetes hosted applications uh usually depending on your um your own definitions of success first of all because there is no one-size-fits-all we still speak of cloud-managed or self-managed infrastructure as a service vip kubernetes engine now hack can be a trick it can be your own kubernetes or something like for example uh kubernetes service from amazon web services or azure or google cloud working with a data tier on the purpose build databases and microservices running on top of them they've or not better to say on top but alongside with them uh we've proper observability stacks for your applications and for your data and that's a very important point because if you don't have proper observability you cannot manage what you can't measure and observability stack became a very very very important uh and then finally getting closer to what we have now we speak about the single observability stack what helps us to keep control on everything and literally each and every aspect of the data and application we are running together and there are a lot of skepticism about running your data on the kubernetes that is well i was uh in this crowd that's for sure you can be absolutely sure i was worried against databases and services and especially running databases on kubernetes because you know first of all containers were burned to be stateless and containers works great as long as they are stateless but then you run into something uh you want to be stateful especially for databases uh kubernetes those times wasn't perfect for red that would raise it actually this skepticism many people thought what you cannot run your databases on kubernetes for this point by the way i do cancer if you ask what i was as skeptic as i do as i did then i do recommend you to get to read this um article from christopher bradford our colleague and project manager for uh kid sandra who was also a skeptic like many of us and finally you know what as he was a skeptic for data on kubernetes now he develops and runs the development of kate sanders which is basically a data on kubernetes so it's quite an interesting transformation and i do suggest you to take a look at it that was right and i i myself i come from the cloud foundry side of the world and and you know um the uh concept of the 12 factor app right you know which is really stateless yes yes was very popular and status apps are great but but you really need um you know data to be persistent you know you think of any application and and admittedly uh it was not easy initially but but you know we are well beyond that and you will see today how you can install kate sander yourself and kind of play around with it and do the routine uh tasks that everybody does you know and and that's really what's exciting uh because you can you know it's really democratized the operations of databases on communities right okay so this talk or this workshop is a part of the data on kubernetes community there is a huge community dok data on kubernetes which basically focuses to make these uh to take care of the reasons what brought these skepticism to happen because it was reasonable for quite a long time okay and they are going to speak about what is kid sandra and why do we speak about that today so kate sandra is a great tool it's an open source project it's mainly developed by data stacks but it's an open source and you always can join the development you can use this project for free on ecas or whatever cloud provider for kubernetes on your own self-hosted kubernetes before i use it to call kate sandra cloud native scalable cassandra with administration tools and easy data access apache cassandra is a database nosql database we will mean a lot but now i say it's a cloud native scalable data tier view administration tools and easy data access why and what changes you will see soon but that's a very important point uh originally idea was to help cassandra running on kubernetes with ease because there is quite a lot of configurations knobs buttons levers you have to push and with a proper help it may be much easier especially when we speak about multi-regions multi-data center deployments that's going to be a very long story but later over this project there were many secret of course not for real secret but many more interesting ingredients added so now kate sandra is not just cassandra on kubernetes it is way much more we will show you today uh first idea was to develop a casa operator if you don't know what is a kubernetes separator don't worry we will explain it today but the idea to use this car saturator didn't really fit now we built uh now we built a kubernetes operator for uh kate sandra to take care of the many tools uh you will see soon but in general that's must be clear but it's not enough to just run a database do you need to understand what's going on in this database yes do you need to have a proper monitoring yes do you need to have proper tools to run backup operations yes and there are some more you need to know so that was also very interesting reading of the new stack dot io how you push it helm to the limit and then build the kubernetes operator and i do recommend you to read it that's a pretty interesting story by our very own jeff carpenter and john sander by the way jeff carpenter is an out co-author of cassandra by definitive guidebook and john sander is one of the best software engineers i've ever seen so those two make a perfect team to write something what may take your attention yeah and and one of the things alex if i may add here is that uh you know we're going to show a multi-region cassandra in operation um so essentially it's going to be two clusters uh and and we gonna network them together um and you'll see that in action later and the idea behind that is that again you know you can take helm only to a certain degree after that you know you have to have you know other components that can help you and that's where the operator kind of comes in because what it's doing is constantly monitoring the state and kind of keeping um track of how many uh you know instances are there what is the desire what is the current and kind of matches them and and uh does the routine operations for you uh that you know otherwise you would have to worry about it yourself right so so um you know uh this blog kind of walks through how you can do this multi-region cassandra and a bunch of other things that are enabled by this new what we call as the kate sandra operator right okay so one of the problems of traditional databases they go for vertical scalability and that means what instead of using more machines and spreading over multiple servers and data centers like you could do with your applications you go and scale your traditional mutually relational databases with vertical scalability replacing the older one with one bigger new more expensive it was an old approach it's easier to get and it is has some downsides first of all it's getting very expensive very soon and that still provides single point of failure so if you know a company running application on kubernetes but running a database outside of a kubernetes mostly probably they are they go for vertical scalability now applications on uh kubernetes and not only go much more often for horizontal scalability that means what when you need a more powerful computational cluster you just add more servers and your kubernetes take takes care of that and automatically can reschedule your ports over those new servers and that's exactly matches the cassandra replica scalability strategy you will see in a moment so now we go to my favorite topic about cassandra and why it was chosen to be the foundation of these data layer on kubernetes why kate sandra is kate sandra bay white k sound is based on cassandra not on for example there are multiple reasons but let's first of all first of all let's discuss the main features of apache cassandra what people and why many companies using that so first apache cassandra was originally developed at facebook and later it was donated to apache software foundation non-commercial non-profit open source foundation uh tomb uh become a top level of it uh very soon in 2010 uh current uh latest stable version is for it's distributed and decentralized database and you know what those two words take only one single line okay distributed decentralized database okay so what how many master nodes does cassandra need cassandra is decentralized it has no master nodes and it's distributed so it can handle any amounts of your data just add more servers cassandra is a perfect fit there are just no better fits to a kubernetes ideology and with it elastic linear scalability if you need more capacity if you need more velocity if you need to handle a higher amount of questions you just add more servers to a cluster no vertical scaling but horizontal scaling and you are good to go it has a globally available way to work so if you need to have multiple regions multiple data centers it's a perfect fit and you can go with it and it works seamlessly it's obviously highly performant cassandra is used by the titans like apple like netflix are one of the biggest cassandra users not only users but also developers now it's very well known for highest possible availability and fall tolerance or some people prefer to say disaster tolerance because that's obviously a very important way for any modern application to be full tolerant or preferably disaster tolerant now with the tunable consistency we will say a bit more about that in the end but very often people say what cassandra is eventually consistent if someone tells you what cassandra is eventually consistent uh you better say cassandra is configurably consistent or tunably consistent that will be a better way to for a phrase the words and in general that's a partition at row store so there are no joins it's not a relational database you cannot make a query run over multiple tables because you know what at the big scale really those joints don't really work if you need your queries to be fast so when you have thousands of servers for your data that won't work how do you work better with cassandra we have a dedicated workshop about that so we won't stay for too long on apache cassandra okay we have more things to cover on today regarding the kate tundra but there are two main concept concepts you need to understand data is distributed and data is replicated what does that mean first of all data is distributed take a look on the right side of my screen you have the simple table population per city per country and that basically means what in the like just a simple table three rows country city population how many people live in the city i guess numbers are a little bit outdated right now you may need to refresh them later but that's not really a matter it's just a demon so how this normally would work with traditional relational databases even if you already have some cluster let's say the full copy of the table will be stored on each and every server right and then there is the second problem uh these uh data works well and your server relational databases work well as long as all your data feeds to a single machine like master slave slave or primary secondary servers or whatever you call them idea is the same at some point as your data grows you don't you can't store it all on a single server and then you have to go for something very bad it should be considered a crime it's called sharding starting is a very very dangerous thing shouting is a very much much of pain and manual thing when you understand what your data in your relational database doesn't fit in the single machine and you have to split it two parts it's a manual project it's a manual process it's basically makes it very hard to use any kind of a relational database features like joints and things and it's quite painful every time you need to add the note or if you have to remove a note node you have to do a lot of manual work so in short friends don't give fred don't let friends use sharding if your database has grown enough to think about sharding you better think on the migration on cassandra it will be in the end much easier because cassandra was created to handle the problems of such a scale so okay but how does cassandra solve this problem with partitioning which has the same idea like sharding you split your table over multiple parts on the database but it is automated completely and you don't have to take care of it manually you just have your table splitted into parts distributed over multiple servers if you add more servers like you expect you are netflix or netflix employee let's say and you expect the release of last series last episode of games of thrones you know what everyone in the world will go and watch it and you have to make your database ready then what do you do you just uh bring more servers to the cluster cluster sees okay i had like let's say 1 000 servers now i have 2 000 servers it means i have to move the partitions partitions being automatically automatically spread over those servers so now now each server takes care of a lesser amount of partitions and in the end every server is able so cluster overall is ready to handle much higher workload much higher amount of requests and then if you are done and no one is going to so the demand on your services decrease it and you don't want to pay prices for more of a cloud infrastructure you know what it will be no big pressure because everyone is sleeping eating discussing on reddit former series you can then take down some of your servers and cassandra cluster will uh and really understand the situation okay you are decommissioning the servers we expect uh not too many a lot let's get those partitions back to the servers what they remain and therefore you will pay less for the infrastructure if you have any experience with sharding you just understand how much it matter what it's all fully automated you put more servers you remove servers and cluster does all the work for you it is amazing i absolutely love partitioning but partitioning is not enough because you know what if data spread it over multiple servers what will happen with french data for per recent to lose if this server is down if this server is down when we cannot access data of friends and that would be quite sad because you know we have arrived a lot of great people in france so let's take care of them okay let's protect them for this issue it's called replication and cassandra uses replication all the time that's how it guarantees highest possible availability at the market of the database management services replication factor is something what defines how many rows how many times a row or better to say partition will be stored on different nodes that means what your data is stored every row every partition you have stored not on the single server but it's stored on usually we recommend duplication factor free so it's stored on three different servers that means what your data then being dispatched to multiple servers and that brings us to the situation on how do we properly distribute these data over multiple servers idea is uh first of all we may have multiple data centers and that matters a lot keep your data close to your clients and we keep things disaster tolerant but meanwhile within a single data center you are going to have multiple server racks or if you are using managed cloud solution then if you you will go for a cloud we will speak not about data centers and racks but we will speak about regions and availability zones mostly probably you know what i mean if you use clout already so what does that mean we have what's the purpose of the availability zones two raise fault tolerance to raise disaster tolerance then your availability zones are basically technically for example for aws those are different data centers with independent power sources when independent network connections and so on there is a probability for what one availability zone will fail together because of power outage and so on but the other availability zones will work successfully because they have independent power uh supply for example and same goes for the data center servers within uh the same racks have higher chance two fail together because server rack may have for example the same power supply and the power outage may take but will wreck down now how exactly uh cassandra puts your data put puts those uh replica replicas because of replication factor free normally we have free replicas it will intentionally put it into the different racks or in the different of availability zones so you can make it and that is again automated so especially with kate sandra for case for cassandra running on your own you have to think more more about that but the general idea is cassandra manages replicas trying to keep your data as far away from each other as it's possible within single region or within a single data center to reach the maximum level of the higher availability or highest availability so [Music] so and last point for me cassandra's fails horizontally that means what if your data model done right and again guess what we have a dedicated cassandra data modeling workshop on our channel which really deserves your time but if your data model done right then cassandra scales horizontally and if tomorrow you have to handle the doublet workload you can just double amount of your servers and it will be perfectly fine [Music] finally cassandra was born to run on multiple data centers and complete the platform agnostic on hybrid cloud and multi-cloud that makes it very capable and that makes it a perfect fit as i said for kubernetes this ability to run over multiple data centers still combining enter the single cluster over multiple data centers and ability to run simultaneously on aws google cloud microsoft azure and of course your own on-premises data center and hey rex yes so you know what i was talking for last for a long time now it's your turn absolutely okay um so let me i'm going to um a little bit fast forward here right and um right so the installation um is pretty straightforward the first thing you need to do is as we call it you know pick up the red pill or the blue pill right uh the blue pill is something you're going to install on the cloud um so if you have a cloud instance already running um you know then you're fine uh you you're gonna use that right um but if you don't have a cloud instance you don't have something installed locally you're gonna pick the you know the blueprint all right sorry the red tail right which basically is um you know i may have it the other way around but but you get the idea uh is um you know you you're gonna install it locally i know the in the chat uh people are already starting to install it on mini cube um you know and some people have tried the data stacks provided vms uh and essentially you have two paths uh one is the data stacks provided vm right and the other is the local or the ceo so you can get a instance in cbo running up and running in in a matter of couple of minutes okay so the first thing it was really quick and and i will walk through that um you know i'm not going to go through the whole thing but essentially the idea behind can everybody see this uh do you want me to i think so oh yeah that no that looks good to me yeah at least on my side it looks good okay fantastic um so obviously you know most people have docker but we put it there anyway right and then you have to have a kubernetes cluster and this is where um you know the resource requirements for local clusters are you know are given here typically you need like about eight gigabyte of space or something like that um you know if you don't have it then you know i think uh the recommendation would be to install sibo okay um but if you have the resources there are a couple of options you can go um one is kind the other is mini cube so you can go either of either of those right um it's always going to be um you know like either a local cluster local install or a cloud install but within a local install it may be a little bit different for cevo a little bit different from kind a little bit different from any cube but we will call it out you know in you know wherever it's relevant uh the first thing you're going to do is you know i'm sure most of you already have this uh you have the cube cuddle uh which is a command line tool uh obviously there are other options that you can use you know many of us use lens uh which is which basically comes with cube color and nowadays you know most of the ides also come with cube cutting command but as long as you have uh access to cube cuddle somehow i think you're good okay um i personally like the cube context tool which is the cube cdx very handy tool you know i don't like typing too much so i i kind of use that quite a bit as well and then what you can do is you can install the watch command on mac which is not for whatever reason not installed by default i use that quite a bit and we have a lot of instructions which which kind of walk through that so once you have all this and once you have the kubernetes cluster access okay then you're going to use helm to either install um you know in kind uh or in mini cube and and if you don't have it installed already we have some steps which talks about how you can install in kind and mini cube okay and and i i will um i will talk to you about that uh one of the one of the key things about you know any of these is that you want to make sure that the storage class is compatible you know with what the operator uses right so so you want to do the cube cuddle get storage classes and you should see something like this where it's like a wait for con first consumer okay uh if if you don't have a wait for first consumer then what we recommend is we recommend you install um you know this this particular uh wrencher you know extension which basically does the local path provisioning okay and you'll see an output which kind of looks like this and then if you do is get storage classes again now what you would do is you'll see you know wait for first consumer you know i think the steps are pretty much the same okay so let me go ahead and try to do an install all right i mean i'll obviously done an install first thing you want to do is do this cube cuddle okay and config get context right so this will give you all the contacts okay so if you're running into some kind of issues you may want to check if you have um you know like for example you can also do this cubeconfig right where you can [Music] you know a particular config file so typically what i do is uh i make sure that you know cubeconfig is set to nothing okay and then what i can do is i make sure i'm running the right context because i have so many of those running um so this is a uh you know i have as you can see i have a docker desktop i have kate sandra i have kind and then have mini cube i've tried it on pretty much all of these and and the nice thing again about kubernetes helm and all that is it's it's exactly the same right and all that i'm going to do is i'm going to cut and paste you know from the command line window and just kind of walk through the steps and when i'm walking through the steps i'm going to you know kind of try to understand what is happening uh under the hood um so so that's kind of let's so let's kind of walk through this so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm uh you know just make sure that this is up and running right so you can see i have something called as ksr okay and you'll see here uh it's running a k3s cluster it's uh three nodes it's been running for about you know like nine days and it's running the 1.20.2 version whatever right i don't care too much about that all that i'm going to do is i'm just going to say hell and i'm going to say install okay so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to say install traffic on the um you know on the particular cluster okay obviously this is going to come back because i think i may have installed this already but it doesn't matter okay so essentially what helm is going to do okay and i'll go back to installing it okay so once you have the local setup okay if you if you want to do the um uh cevo then what you're going to do is you're going to follow the steps for sibo and and you know it kind of walks you through that it talks about how you can create an account and then get an api key install the cevo cli um you know add the api i'm having trouble hearing you add the api key ignore ignore that that's my watch and then you know you make that current and then you create a cluster and once you have the cluster created which is really what what i'm using uh then you merge it into your configuration file and and if you do a config use context it will use the right context and then you can you know kind of look at what that cluster is and then now once you've done this you can do this sivocubenities show cassandra okay i'm going to show that just for so instead of kate sander i'm using a different cluster here okay and hopefully this should work okay so you can see here this is my cluster it's running in frankfurt okay and it has an id uh it has an api endpoint uh it has a dnsa record you know which are which is all things that i'm using and and you'll see that you know in a little bit okay um so so how do i go about installing it you know it's pretty straightforward it's it's in the slides uh but it's also in the um in the instructions um you know all that you're gonna do is you're going to add the repo which is the kate sandra helm charts which is available in a helmet.kate sandra io you just add it to your helm chart helmet repositories you do a helm repo update and then you do a helm install kate sander after you've done traffic uh you're gonna install kate sandra in this following way the only thing that's gonna change is you're gonna specify a different file okay and that file otherwise um you know what's going to happen is it's going to take the default values which may not work for every instance right you know for we customize it for for example if you're doing a production cloud then what we do and you'll see that later in action uh you have three instances of that so that it's you know if if something goes down uh it's still available right you know because the other two can serve it um so so there are different options um but you know again if you go to kate sandra at i o uh and look through the docs it kind of walks through all that but our workshop instructions also kind of deal with that and kind of talk about how we can do that okay so let me go ahead and install and again you know i've done this before so um you know it's probably not going to be too interesting tremendously interesting but really it it takes uh you know a couple of minutes to install uh and maybe uh about six more minutes you know for everything to be up and running uh including all the components and then you're good to go okay so how do i install this again the same command right so install um so use this for local and cbo installs right all that i'm going to do is i'm going to say helm install i'm going to use the same repository the gate center repository which i already added and and basically use the um you know the kate center component to be installed and i'm going to call it as kate sandra and and i'm going to specify the values in uh kate sandra local seaboard at yama okay so so let's go ahead and do this anyway uh even though i know i've done this already okay so that's fine we can ignore that not a big deal um so now if i go back to and take a look at you know what this is okay you can see here there are a couple of these things that i'm using um you know the kate sandra local keyboard at yamo are if you you know if you look at your you know install you'll have a kate sander or a dml that you're going to use okay so uh let's look at this briefly okay so you can see here what version of case uh cassandra are you using uh you're installing right and then you have different resources that are listed here and this is the data center that we'll you know we'll kind of access as we look at you know the the different components we have grafana installed we have stargate and we'll look at all this in a uh you know in in a few slides but essentially the idea behind stargate is it provides a unifying api to be able to access this is more from a developer perspective we're going to install a uh an application called pet clinic which is essentially derived from a sample app called from spring and using that um you know we can we can actually access the data on the back end by using the stargate apis there are a number of ways of accessing it you can do graphql which is really cool but you can also do rest you can also do sql uh you can and you know so it's basically a unifying api uh and and you know this this yaml file does a little bit of that you know or like i said customizes it now once you're installed it you should see something like this okay if you just do a couple get parts okay uh you'll see that uh you know most of these are running right so here's my cash operator uh we will walk through all of this traffic is already running grafana is running traffic is running um you know there is cube there is reaper wheel we're going to talk about all that and i've already installed pet clinic so you know when i when i go to that particular exercise i'll delete it and reinstall it but you also have stargate and and a bunch of other components okay so maybe what we should do at this point alex is should we take a pause and see if everybody is uh kind of um up to speed or should i just we can for sure but i wouldn't be focused so much on the pace because anyway our training instances are still they stay available for some time after workshop and you can always catch up later and watch the recording so we will be good all right yeah so yeah we can make a little pause here for a moment yeah let's take a pause for a moment uh any questions that you know we can i'd be happy to take a look you mentioned various file uh it's in the repo for the so github.com slash work kid sandra slash workshop if you get some deprecation warnings uh blah blah blah port security policy is deprecated uh it's completely fine just exist yeah good point so all the files are available in this particular directory we i just put it on chat github.com case channel workshop yep and yes you are getting the recording that is for sure oh thank you for pasting the link yeah that is good so adit shetty uh asked a question i'm getting an error while installing helm um i i i feel like what if you're doing this on civo probably uh then then what might have happened is that you may have installed without traffic um so if you if you look at the civil install let me go back to that uh we basically make sure that we install it without cbo okay so so you can see here without traffic and maybe that's the reason why it may be happening so so what you want to do is you want to specify this minus r traffic so that um you know it's not installed uh by default so maybe that's what's happening uh but but if you want to put a little bit more information on where this is happening we can help you all right yep or maybe it is running already simply because uh if port is allocated already then maybe it's just running and you are trying to install it again that also can be the point okay [Music] so so i think there are questions about how do we access the data stacks provided instance alex maybe you can help help with that uh so uh easiest way here to go with sivo exactly as described into the documentation workshop and if workshop is done and some time has gone and siva generous offer is not available anymore you can contact me in person in linkedin or via email and i will spawn a training instance for you if you wait for a moment i will send you the link to contact me but please i won't be able to dispatch you yes uh i won't be able to dispatch you a training instance right now only after this uh training is done because i have other things to do and link is in this zoom chat good so if you will need a training instance later then you can catch me good and ex uh rakhavan uh said uh very right you can create your own cluster with google kubernetes engine or amazon web services or azure and whatever you prefer that's all support perfectly fine so [Music] so the system volume claims um you know just make sure you've installed rancher extension um you know i i kind of walked through that but but make sure that that's happening so so what i would do is run this particular command which is get storage classes okay cube color get storage classes okay and then if if that run this anyway okay the cube catalog reply uh and and install the rancher okay so that may be what is happening to uh who's that peter zoo he did okay okay okay so so what it is um one of the things you can do is you can just go ahead and help delete kate sandra so i'm gonna put that command here you know if you need to reinstall you can just say helm delete etc and then install it again okay so you know there may be some times when when you know you may have to kind of reboot so to say um then what you can do is you can you can just try the helm upgrade uh and and instead of install you know the install command that you have just put the upgrade in there uh and and you know that should fix things for the most part again you know you don't have to do that but but this is again just for instruction and it might actually be useful for you to try that out okay so what you can do is you can just do a helm upgrade and the exact same command uh and and you know the uh you can get the uh um the cluster back to kind of the initial state so i have only one laptop it seems that i should have set up another screen to follow no you can you can just bring up multiple command line windows so it should be pretty straightforward yeah yeah like jeff jeff says you know for production we don't really recommend you using port forward um you know you want proper ingress but but for a workshop like this i think it's just perfectly fine to be able to do uh port forwarding because in effect that's exactly what you're doing and i'll show that as well um you know when when we are working with the data okay so port forwarding i think kind of gives you a little bit of under the hood view as well so so i think that's that's good so let me continue with the components and then we can take a pause again um is that good alex yeah yes yes all good yeah all right hopefully you can see my screen now um essentially what yeah does it kind of straddles the um data part and the infrastructure part because kubernetes by itself is not enough right so uh you know that's why we came up with this concept of cache operator and then refined it further to come up with the gate sander operator right and what that does is like for example you know you can set node affinity i think one of you is adit i think is using the google cloud right gke and maybe what you're you know you have multiple zones multiple availability zones and you may want parts to be nicely distributed across those zones so you can set affinity to for the different data centers and things like that and that's possible and that's exactly the value that the cadet sandra operator or the cas operator is going to provide and there are a bunch of other things it does as well um you know that that you need to you don't need to worry about but it also um you know takes care of the data aspect you know which is why you've come here right you know you want to install a cassandra database you want to be able to access it using stargate uh so so what it does is it kind of straddles the two and and and makes it very easy to access the cluster that you just just created um you know either using uh stargate or maybe even just using sql sequence sql as we'll talk in in a moment is the cassandra query language so really what what you know kate sandra is is really a scalable cloud native database managed by the class operator which is going to be replaced by the kate sander operator it is a data gateway providing the rest uh graphql and document apis it's a unifying api it's available as target you can use any ingress really but you know we document quite a few cases using traffic and again for the purposes of today for the exercise uh for the workshop today uh i think you don't even need to set up ingress except for one exercise where it may be required um and and you know especially if you're using a sibo instance then it might be required but uh um you know it works with different ingresses and it kind of and that's again the nice thing about communities is that you kind of rely on other components and make it work and you know whatever infrastructure that you're going to use reaper we have a exercise for this which is essentially a bunch of utilities for repair and backup um of course nothing is complete without uh monitoring right observability has become a big uh aspect uh in in all of these microservice based approach very critical and prometheus and grafana is one of the first exercises that you know alex is going to talk to you about right and all of these again is packaged and delivered by hum charts uh if you if you're really uh you know a uh helm geek or you want to know a little bit more about this you know we have sub charts and you can kind of look through this all of these are available in github as well we would ideally like you guys to kind of help us uh by at least putting some uh full requests or or maybe even um helping us uh come up with these help charts as well so typically what um operators do is just helm install helm upgrade or help delete whatever as the case may be right and what it does is it's pointed to your kubernetes communities cluster uh which is what you know is the context right and what it does is it installs all of these components okay uh and then how do you get access to it is through in english right in a typical production environment that's exactly what you do you don't really worry too much about you know how to access this target directly but you know what you're going to do is you're going to use this wire traffic and again for today we might be doing port forwarding but you know if you substitute the port forwarding with ingress that's exactly what you see in this picture okay and again operators will will have access to some of these components directly as well you know as a developer i probably don't care about many of these but but you know um it it all depends on kind of what what hat you're gonna wear right as an operator as a developer as an operator i'm interested probably in the right right side of this and as a developer i'm interested more and kind of the uh how do i get the data access and so on now we also have a way in which we can do backup and restore in you know a variety of clouds and we leverage what is referred to as mineo and and the exercises i actually walk through that which is a simple uh object storage based around amazon s3 which is available on multiple clouds or even on local infrastructure okay now this is kind of putting the same thing you know like slightly different picture uh and these are all the port forwardings that you're going to set up you know the blue dots that you're going to see to make sure that you know you can have access to all of these different components okay and and the workshop instructions are going to walk through which ports you need to forward and so on um and and you know again in in a typical production environment you're not going to worry about that but because you're going to do um you know set up the ingress it leverages the secrets let me go back sorry it leverages secrets and and that's kind of how you know it's done in kind of a secure fashion and we'll see how we create some secrets uh you will see you'll walk through the instructions uh so there's really a whole lot of things that are coming together and and you know uh the nice thing about kate sandra when i started using this is uh i myself learned learned a lot about kubernetes that i did not know before uh and and you know it talks about how how these different components are installed um you know what are crds and and how you know i don't need to worry all that i'm going to do as a user or as a system administrator is just going to ensure the helm install command or if i am a a developer all that i'm going to do is just you know install the yaml file for the application uh and i'm um and i'm uh up and going right so makes it very easy um so um is there anything uh else that i missed alex is this good uh i think we are good yes yes yes all right so with that um you want to take over with monitoring uh give me a second to check could you please meanwhile check chat for the questions sure i'm going to check that i'm going to stop sharing so uh seema amwad asked the question uh i'm not able to open traffic local seaworld adiamo that's in the workshop directory and that's where you get started so maybe i'll i'll i'll repeat that again you know the instructions okay so if you don't mind i'll do the screen share again and you know we want yes please we'll just start using it right so so essentially so what you're going to do is you're going to click on this link right and um it has this particular local sevo okay so either either you can download that but ideally what i would do is you know just um download this either git clone it or download the zip file um or you know there are a number of different ways of kind of getting this yaml file okay but but all of these is set up in here okay um and you can start using okay um oh um i don't think i screen share it so let me repeat that again for the benefit of that happens no worries yes yeah so so essentially what you're going to do is you're going to click on that link and that will bring you to this particular page and you will see here there is a case under local c word yamo and you can either get cloned the whole directory i mean the whole repository sorry or what you can do is you can you can download this zip file if you you know it's really completely up to you how obvious you want to do that and then after that just open the labs in wiki okay so just click on this particular link and now you know it'll walk you through the different steps okay so we did the first step okay and we did the local setup and all that right and then you know we can look at how to kind of do this in a communities um you know the appropriate kubernetes clusters for example for local civil installs what you have to do is you have to set up this port forwarding okay as you can see here okay and you will see um i will do that as well so all that you need to do is just do this right now if you uh look at the uh jobs you'll see that you know it's running this port forwarding and next all that i'm gonna do is just click on this right so really all that you you're going to do is just follow the instructions here and you will you'll you'll be uh directed to traffic okay uh so once you see traffic okay then you can click you know you can click around and kind of look around you can see here i have set up some paths you know which are really ingresses and so on so all of these are in the instructions but the first place you want to get started um you know is let me stop sharing the screen is really start with that workshop directory okay and let me know which you know if you have any any issues after that all right alex it's all yours uh should we again give people a little bit of time uh yes i believe we can give people a little bit of time and i'm like i know i know that one person rom is using it on windows i'm sorry we don't really have the time to kind of go through the windows uh i i yeah i'm sorry yeah we we have some recommendations what you can do is you can use git pod um and and with git part you get a linux um and an ide uh a linux command line so so if you don't have access to the linux tools if you don't have access to cube cutting tools it's easier to install it with git pod but we really don't have time to help you with you know the windows aspect sorry yes and if you uh take a look if it doesn't work out how you want it to work today then don't worry contact me and i will i will create a linux virtual machine for you in the cloud so you still will be able to do all the exercises uh the if or without linux or android or freebsd or whatever you prefer we have you cover it okay so that should be quite easy i hope so and good so so there was a question about what what do i have to install helm yes the local installs kind of walk through that uh step six of the local setup um kind of walks through that please uh install it uh with with you know depending on what environment you're in right so so if you don't if you get a um helm and um you know you you cannot do anything after that you obviously have to install hack all right yes uh helm is a package manager if you didn't if you haven't met that before helm is kinda a package manager for kubernetes it's a technically this name is wrong henry's not package manager right uh but it works very close to the idea how opt or hume or whatever package manager you are using works basically the idea is the going to be exactly the same so should we try to get a thumbs up from people who have already set up uh kids handler yes please uh that definitely makes sense thank you thank you for the immediate response very cool nice the competition is not over yet we will come to that later but let's focus on getting the kids under cluster going first perfect if you have any other questions you know feel free to put it in chat or you know discard chat actually is going to keep a record and there are a lot more people helping there as well so there's a question about kate sandra helm chart how does differ using uh from using kudo um i myself haven't used kudos so i don't know the answer to that um anybody else no uh which technology is mentioned sorry k-u-d-o sorry you know uh this uh frankly speaking this world of kubernetes really reminds me of a world of front end uh in the very last few years when new technology new technologies was spawned get to the top of the world and then they were completely abandoned and forgotten within one year so no sorry we don't have these questions experts there right uh kubernetes experts so maybe you can add you know what what kudo is and how would the person have yeah i see it mentioned in the chat by lewis thank you i will take a look that's interesting and uh question from pavan kumar how do i use cloud instance what is offered by you people so how do you use it you use it accordingly to the installation instructions you have in github and how do you get it is i will again paste the link to my uh https i will paste the link again to myself on linkedin so you can you can catch me after after the uh workshop good so uh yes looks like good question by aman don't forget the trailing slash and dashboard then it will say give a incorrect path okay so that's great thank you aman okay okay so maybe you can go on and show uh grafana and prometheus part because i believe a lot of people are ready to follow along already okay you want me to do it uh okay you know i can do it actually as well i'm just not sure if it is already at this side was okay cassandra overview no data so far i'm not sure if my cassandra has started already so i have empty grafana and primary fuse at this moment which is a bit not enough to show sure which is developed because prometheus is running so yeah maybe you can show it oh no it's starting i hope so looks like i know if yeah i believe you better start because i'm not perfectly sure if it will work go for it yeah so you better start okay okay so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to follow the instructions so let me keep my fingers crossed and hope that it's going to work okay so let's let's go with sharing my screen okay and again the first thing i do no matter what is i make sure that i'm running the right context because that's the first thing you know you want to check so i am running the uh ksr which i know is my uh my sibo cluster right and what i'm going to do is i'm going to make sure um you know i'm the parts are up and running right so so just just make sure that it's all running right so you can see all of them are running which is which is kind of cool okay so um then what i'm going to do is just go into the instructions which talk about that okay so i'm going to open that this is exactly what is on the wiki um you know because i just chucked it in right and what exercise are we in we are monitoring kit scanner right so i am a local civo install so all that i'm going to do is i'm going to set up the port forward right so i'm going to set up all these three right and set up power forwarding pretty straight sorry i'm laughing because the very moment i told you okay go on it started to visualize the date on my site perfect perfect you we can show that also because that will give a difference between local um install and a vm generated install right you know right so so let me finish this and then you can yeah of course of course okay so i think this is fantastic so so now what we're going to do is use the links um 9292 for prometheus because if you go back and look uh you know if you just do a um the background jobs that are created you can see here grafana is sitting at 9191 prometheus is 92-92 and reaper which we're going to see in the last exercise is 93.93 okay so all that i'm going to do is i'm going to access uh you know one of these right so let me go to my edge device okay and uh i'm going to do localhost 9191 that's it as simple as that and hopefully this is going to work right so so this is the login and it will let me log in okay there is grafana coming up okay cool okay and uh i think the default that we have set up is admin and admin so it asks me again because it's the default so let me put it in any way i don't care okay and i'm good to go right again um you know thankfully i'm not an operator because you know i violate all this rules for passwords and all that but but what you're going to do is you're going to walk through this right you look at the cassandra overview um this will give you a view of the dashboard what are the recent throughputs what is the read write distribution how many nodes are in there um what is the disk space usage uh a whole bunch of stuff right so you can kind of look through all of these um and then you know if you go back to here okay i don't care about this dashboard because one of the nice things about grafana is that it allows you to create uh customized dashboards okay so we just saw the cassandra you know you can look at stargate you know how many http requests per second uh nothing really right now right because nothing has happened uh and and you can kind of walk through this okay so uh so that kind of gives you an idea of uh how to use uh prometheus right or graffana sorry um and i did 911 so if i do 92.92 okay you can execute this different instructions you can select you can select any metric and see uh what's the current status and see what's the data you have exactly exactly so so you can kind of you know there are some there are some examples of what to use here as well um or if you if you're really interested you can go to just kate sandra i o um you know and i'll kind of walk through that um if you if you look at this keith sandra that i oh and and just go through the docs you know you can kind of walk through what you do from a sre perspective okay and this is exactly what what i did 91 91 92 92 okay you configure the port forwarding um and then what you're going to do is you execute this particular um so you click on 92.92 and verify the these things are running and then what you're going to do is you you know so you you choose the target and verify that these particular things are are working okay so so all that you're going to do is you're going to follow the instructions so this is kind of the local install so what alex is going to now show you is the data stacks provided vm which is actually running a vm with a local install of kind but you know it's on a net network which makes it a little bit interesting so again you know kubernetes gives you different combinations uh we are not going to be able to cover all of them because we just don't have the time but at least we'll give you a flavor of that yep well i'm not really sure if well i do can to show it but i'm not really sure if we have to do it because it will for the end user let's say it will look the same i have grafana running on my cloud instance as a part of the story height video panel yep i have grafana running as a part of my cloud installation and the idea is the same we have prometheus and prometheus use it as a storage place for metrics uh for monitoring purposes so that must be familiar for you if you already working with kubernetes deployments if you don't it may deserve your interest and it collects a lot of metrics uh from different points from different metrics and you see as you see here uh metrics collector for apache cassandra is the tool we use to get data from cassandra and put it to prometheus and to grafana and i can execute the statement they see okay there is some data we receive some information from our notes but if you want to see the graphs then it's much better to go to grafana and important point i want to highlight here grafana is install it as a part of our kate sandra deployment so if you go for cube ctl gear ports you will see here grafana running as kit sandra grafana blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and you know what batteries are included by but swoopable if you already have your own grafana deployment you of course don't have to in a enable and install our grafana you can just connect it to the existing uh kids android deployment which won't have grafana in this case as you can figure that but what matters it's not enough just to con connect uh mce metrics collector for apache cassandra to prometheus and prometheus to grafana you have to understand what to visualize and our deployment of grafana is of course have a great set of dashboards ready panels and dashboards for them so we can go for cluster condensate and see their particular status and particular views over time and actually that's a very smart thing so you can group it by cluster by data center by rack and even by host the only point is what at the moment it's a cluster of a single data center of a single rack of a single host so information won't vary but in your production deployment of course it will be different so we can go for a smaller rate and we can go for smaller rates we can filter by data centers and racks we can even filter by key by key spaces and find the difference and understand what's going on we can go up to host specific deployments we can specify which percentile we are interested in this moment and get different information and also that's a cassandra cluster condenser overview so it makes the general understanding of what's going on the compaction latencies coordinators and so on and of course there are some more dashboards uh so system and node metrics this is one quite traditional that's to understand the server states so uh you see cassandra or not cassandra you have to understand cpu consumption memory consumption disk space consumption which is incredibly important especially with cassandra and so on and so forth and finally we can go uh for the overview on some more specific uh kate sandra notes to focus on the read latencies uh request counts and so on and so forth so one question there's a great yeah sure here how can we connect our own from uh prometheus or graphene instances to kate sanders instance so in other words can we take our kids and push it to you know this instance that they are monitoring in a kind of in a centralized place right okay so uh if you use uh kate sandra weave monitoring enabled i mean kate sandra monitoring enable it when it's all out of the box so literally let's take a look at the command what deployed these uh [Music] of you all these beauty so let me clear it a little bit and command what install it it was just helm install hate sandra with some values as uh raghavan already has shown you so if we go for caitsandra.com you will see everything what is enabled here cube prometheus stack blah blah blah blah blah stargate reaper cassandra so everything was configured here and then i just go for helm install and it works out of the box including setting data transfer metrics dashboards and variables and prometheus and everything so you have all of that running of the box i didn't do anything to get this point uh and uh if you already have your uh grafana and prometheus running somewhere and you want to uh make it um for our cassandra kidzandra so you won't enable cate sandra built in as said batteries are included by but swappable so you can completely configure it on uh with cassandra to work with your own prometheus deployment and with your own grafana deployment that's uh explain it in details in k200 documentation i don't want to go too deep into that because it's already a little bit specific use case so we better proceed so again you know let's remind everyone that you know this card is really the best way to get you know support for this uh because i think like like you maybe other attendees will probably have the same questions as well um and you know discard is probably the best place to get more support uh i know we are up to two hours right now already um you know but but i think yeah and we have some more time once we're created i think we're we're you know these these exercises we can run through pretty fast okay yeah yeah right so uh we can go uh for we discussed monitoring cal radium uh and we discussed at monitoring cal already so we can go to high availability step right right yes i'm going to go i'm going to proceed to have eliminative step so take a look cassandra replicates data over multiple nodes that means what in any moment of a time with a single data center replication factor free you are going to have at least three copies of your data that means what if one server is down you will still have your database operational and answering your questions replication is a very powerful mechanism meanwhile if you write data and one of the servers was down at this moment that means what we've single data center replication factor free two servers will be updated and third one won't be because it was down during the write you understand the situation i believe three servers responsible for your data one is down you made an insert adding new customer for example for making and whatever your customer makes and you order at your site you have now new instance created new euros but deliver it only to two servers out of three one was down and it was unavailable now don't worry don't be scared because first of all as said cassandra is very smart and cassandra is able to handle of this situation at the self-healing capability self-healing means what server will recover and information will be recovered and delivered to this server completely without your participation and that is amazing just like that's really is amazing what is the mechanism behind that let's take a look we have three servers responsible for the data and one server who got their requests don't forget cassandra is decentralized so we can deliver you can reach with your queries any of your servers and it will take care of the rest of the things and you will be good [Music] it doesn't matter if that's the replica server for partition 59 or it isn't doesn't matter so then this query coordinator sees what there is no confirmation what was data was stored at the failed server that's completely fine it will store and persist so-called hindered hand-off hidden hinted handoff is the first layer of cassandra's defense versus cross-node inconsistency what happens then then the server uh will be recovered it will announce like okay guys i'm back online what's going on what did i miss anything the one who stored this hinted handoff we'll send it to the failed server recovery server okay that's what you've missed and again as i said that's executed completely automatically so you don't have to do anything in order to protect the the situation from this so that's the story that's the main story behind this so we can show recovering from a failed node i'm only thinking if we should yeah let's recover from a failed node in the simple way and that's not for me relevant okay good recovering from affiliate note okay yes finally so i will do it using my uh cluster in the cloud and i will do it following the steps for we have for this installation [Music] recovering from a failed node with kit sandra recovering from a failed node is very easy because kate sander takes care of your operations it's fully automated and uh it will be like very simple one first i'm going to get the list of the bots so let me clear that and let me get the list of the bots so you've seen that already we have here the main board for us is kit sandra dc1 default stateful set zero it's it's cassandra node number one if they get to them there is my command [Music] here i want to check the status of my cluster and looks like it's somehow lost so okay i will give i will give this comment again not a big problem right i need to get the password and i will connect to my cassandra node that is my password and i will wrong button [Music] i will ask for these status okay uh but but i have to replace the password of course so what's my password okay so most of you must be not familiar with note 2 because most of you have no prior experience with cassandra i will help you so we have here information about current node i'm just executed command node tool status it looks a little bit wider because first i have to go for cube ctl exec when i have to specify which board i'm addressing and which container in this port i'm addressing can then give user name and password but what really matters here is node 2 status so and here is my status i have data i am in data center dc1 datacenter1 i have one node and the most important here is you and like united nations but it's actually up and normal uh so u means up and n means normal it means what is it has joined at cluster and it's all good so far we have cluster of one node but soon we will fix that now what's going on to happen next recovering from a failed note how it works it kate sandra i'm going to go and destroy my uh stateful set and no although instruction suggests me to use grace period five i want to be cruel on that and i'm going to skip grace period and i'm just going for cube ctl delete port k200 dc1 default stateful set 0. it's exactly the server you are seeing here but more kubernetes name of this node right and port was just been brutally deleted like it's not a normal so in general if you run a kids under cluster please don't do that because uh watch uh uh you will notice what it's not exactly the idea okay i was too late i should have executed cube cdlga watch bots a bit sooner so uh the general idea is if you run your production cluster dot don't kill it like i do if you decommission if you want to decommission a node you don't do it with uh delete bot okay you instead of that uh decrease uh the uh count and have their kids under yamal file mostly probably but what matters as soon as the port was destroyed brutally then a kid sandra immediately notices what the port was destroyed and you know what it creates it again it's a fresh new port but because it was not just a random board but part pawed what was a part of a stateful set it's perfectly fine and now we see how kate sandler starts it and yay that is running uh and this just seen how it's looking at the current state and the desired state and it's matching it right and that's really right not anything unique of our operator it's it's a it's it's exactly what kubernetes does which is really referred to as self-saving right so yeah yes yes so uh there are two important points there and again we see what our note is up in normal state now there are two layers of healing first healing uh stateful sad spots it is taking care by kid sandra by cassandra or sorry cassandra by kubernetes at the very end but in uh the case of the data so what data will not be missing it will be taking the this taken care of by cassandra so you see it's a teamwork and teamwork makes dream work we have here cassandra and kubernetes seamlessly working together and taking care of first no as soon as a pod is crushed it will be restarted and if in case some data may be lost it will be kept by the query coordinators and then dispatched later to have failed states to affiliate notes recover it knows better to say don't blame the failed nodes that's mostly probably not their fault that's usually power outage or something like that good and uh let me think i believe we just did uh with this part and we can proceed to next part and what was the next part i think this is the data api access data api access okay so i will switch to your screen so i mean you will start sharing right yes thank you okay good so you can go okay so let me um let's start looking at data and api access with stargate okay and um we have a bunch of things here um in exercise four and five uh but you can kind of go through them really quickly um and the idea is that uh you know it needs to work with both you know the dev side and the upside right and the idea is that uh you know it should be easier for sres to set up developers to be able to use you know the different apis whether i'm using document api or whether you're using graphq graphql or i'm just you know doing sql i think there was a question i'm sorry i'm sorry are you sharing your screen because i cannot see it yeah oh yeah now good thank you thank you yeah and and the idea behind the this particular slide is that uh you know it shouldn't it should be easy for both developers and system administrators to be able to do that stargate provides a wonderful way of unifying these different apis you know it's basically a way in which um you know you can access the data in different forms kind of polymorphic access to data if you will and again with microservices teams each team will have their own strengths so each team might prefer to do it in a different way and stargate actually allows access to that the rationale behind developers is you know there may be different query languages that you are kind of used to it um how do you how how do i kind of deal with it rather than kind of opening up all the ports but what you're going to do is you know open up limited ports and just make stargate um as a unifying point or kind of a api gateway if you will uh not quite api guarantee but but that's the idea behind being able to use the different apis right so there are a whole bunch of uh apis that we're looking into and one of the cool things that's coming especially from a micro services perspective uh is grpc um grpc is kind of the the the right way of of doing it with microservices because any of the other approaches um um you know kind of uh is not it's kind of an anti-pattern for microservices um and and grpc is coming uh pretty soon uh if not already right uh and and the nice thing again is that you know if you're using different versions of cassandra it doesn't matter even data stacks enterprise uh they're all front-ended uh by stargate and all that you're going to do is you're going to funnel your request into stargate stargate is going to do the right thing and give you back the response appropriately okay so with that said let's look at some of these exercises and again all that i'm going to do is just follow the instructions very faithfully okay so let me go into the instructions i think the first thing that's going to do that we're going to look into is uh look into installing a application called pet clinic okay and i'm going to open that okay so let me see where i am before i go it's target let me go with working with data okay so i'm going to install this pet clinic okay so i'll make sure that this particular application is not installed as always just to be sure i just do a cube context okay make sure that i'm running you know ksr you know if anything i just do the kubernetes nodes and i know you know this may seem like repetition but but i've been burnt several times by not doing this already okay i install it in the wrong cluster i think it makes it easier but but um so let me go ahead and and delete this if it's running okay so so what i'm going to do is instead of apply i'm going to i'm just going to delete this okay and then i'm going to start again i'm going to delete it and it's all gone okay so now i'm going to apply it right and the beautiful part about this is that all the components that we're going to see here um you know the front end uh uses and i'll look at the ammo file in a second when when this is spinning up okay and we'll just yeah it's okay all right so what we have is a deployment and it has a bunch of uh you know applications here pet clinic front end and back end right and what it's doing is is providing the secrets for cassandra your user and password to be able to access it and then i look at listening ports and all that which all happens under the hood and that's the nice part about this is you know just by using the aml file i'm able to stand up this application okay then i have the back end the back end is talking you know with a particular port which i really don't care because all that the back end is going to do is going to provide access to this front end and once the front end is up and running you know it's going to stand up as service and that's kind of how i am going to access that okay so so very straightforward okay uh if you see the instructions uh it will tell you you know this is a a cbo install like i said so um i i look at this particular ip address that's been created right and and all that i'm going to do is i'm going to look into this particular address and hopefully if everything is working you know the spring pack clinic should start loading so initially you know what it's doing is the spring uses a concept of what is referred to as lazy loading so it's not going to load you know these classes unless it's required and it's going to be injected at runtime right so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to go into pet types okay and uh let me see just give me a second it should come up you can see veterinarians okay yeah i'm not seeing that let me see what's going on here let me go back home but but you know you should be able to spin it up and see this up and running and and one of the nice things about this is i've also set it up for uh um you know uh essentially what i've done is i've forwarded my domain you know to this uh so if i just do a curl ragsonness.com i believe that's what you i should be able to see this as well so if i just go to ragzinos.com that's all i need to have access to this particular application okay so it's doing the right forwarding okay and it's bringing up the application okay and you can see the pet types here right and i can add that pet type right i'm going to add a pet type of alex as well okay or you can you know going to look look at all the veterinarians and the nice thing is you can get access to this through sql as well uh as we'll see in a moment okay so again the next step is you know we we install the spec clinic it's all up and running okay and and you to see it's up and running again very easy all that we do is we just do the cue pedal get parts if i can spell it okay um so you'll see that you know the spring pack clinic is up and running okay um it must be up and running somewhere in there back end oh um there was a problem here but but the other um i'm not quite sure what what happened here i'll figure that out but essentially you saw that actually being deployed on on silver okay um okay uh so for for local installs it's a little bit different for mini cube it's again a little bit different but in principle it's it's it's exactly what you know is outlined in uh in this document so the next thing we're going to do is we're going to set up the um port forwarding okay and let's see if everything is running here looks like everything is running okay and i'm going to run put forward this okay now what i'm going to do is i'm going to retrieve the super user password okay because i really have access to all that right so i get the super user's password and then i get the super user pass user name and now the password okay so i'm getting the password so this is the password i'm going to use okay so essentially what i'm going to do is i'm going to sql u-sql on this particular k-center cluster okay um let me do this again all right and i'm going to put the password and it's this right and hopefully if everything works we should be able to get sql access to this okay so there i am okay so now again all that i'm going to do is i'm going to look at the what are the different key spaces in here okay i'm going to use the spring pad clinic and i'm going to describe the tables okay yep so and notice this is a different database different standard cluster so you might see things a little bit different but but you kind of get the idea what what i'm going to do here is kind of look through the data and then exit the sequel okay i'm sorry if you uh struggle to understand what that means uh to define what is described what is the key space why you spring pet clinic what is select all blah blah blah and uh if you don't understand what exactly going on here it's completely fine it's basic cassandra aquarium language equations correct and if you don't know what's going on here we do invite you to attend our intro to cassandra workshop or at least watch the recording it very much deserves your time absolutely yeah good good point there uh with that let me move on to the next exercise too because i don't think we have too much time here right um right so so the next time the next exercise is really about um using stargate okay so again same um principle right you access the stargate uh by you know essentially this is a rest-based uh call you again plug in the kait sender username and the gate center password okay and what you're going to do is you're going to get back a token okay so a token kind of looks like this auth token and an access token and then what you're going to do is you're going to use this access token to plug it in here you know what is the accent cassandra token in the http header and then you can access the same data um with you know using rest rather than with sql that we show right i mean a lot of people may not be comfortable using sql they would rather use rest based call and all that you know um the uh the stargate what it does is it provides a swagger interface for you a rest interface to be able to um walk through this and like what alex said uh you know if if you you want to know a little bit more details about you know how to access these endpoints and so on uh you can even create an astrodb uh with with free credits and and actually it provides you with a swagger ui that you can you can call these endpoints it will provide you with a token that you can use and so on uh and and walk through that okay so that should be a uh that should be good enough alex uh any anything you want to add yes i think so i think we are good yeah um so uh i think we can so so here here are some of the examples like for example getting key spaces uh you know inserting documents and so on and and you know the instructions kind of what uh walk through all of that if you're interested in doing graphql we again have a workshop extensively focusing on that document api it doesn't matter you can do all of that as well do you think do you think we have a topic what is not covered uh by one of our workshops i don't i mean like whatever whatever whatever we speak we always like okay by the way we have a dedicated workshop about that we don't have one i can i can come up with one i i'm gonna do a quarkus and cassandra workshop uh in a couple of weeks so i'm still working on it but but you know again great for microservices but but you're right you know we have so many workshops you can you can definitely learn a lot uh from the workshops and i'm gonna stop talking about our workshops alex okay so uh now you know what uh we did quite a lot we deployed we monitor it we discussed how it fails and starts automatically how it recovers from problems automatically but that's not enough in the beginning i told you what there are things like replication factor and how can we have any kind of replication factor if we so far have only one node let's move on with that first thing we have to take care of is uh understanding of the scaling here understanding of the cassandra scaling uh primary you have to get that two points only two first cassandra scales elastically today you need one server well that's not a cassandra way but you can go with that tomorrow you need five servers perfectly fine next week you need five dozens that works as well and even one here you will need five thousands you will have and you can have five thousands of servers that's what uh known as cassandra elastic scaling there are basically nearly no limitations on how big your cluster can be and that's a very very very important point but second thing you need to get is a linear scaling because okay elastic scaling just a simple concept elastic scaling means you can have more and more servers as a result you can have more and more velocity and volume and stay on top of the situation even if you have now like billions of clients but with a linear scaling it's a little bit more advanced concept so i know you are tired after two and a half hours but now please wake up and let's take a look on that linear scaling means what there is no overhead or adding on adding new nodes and if it's not clear at the moment let's take a look normally with a traditional relational databases especially you can add more servers into the cluster but they always have overhead and they have also another problem what some of them will be right read and some of them will be read-only replicas not in cassandra cassandra is decentralized elastic linear for scaling and you can write to any of the notes it still will be processed but there is no overhead on adding new nodes what exactly that means late let's take a look at the research was done not by data stocks but by netflix from years ago netflix did an incredible uh research on how benchmarking cassandra scalability on over 1 million brides per second 1 million of writes per second that's quite a lot ladies and gentlemen so take a look by the way if you are not subscribed to netflix tech blog i do suggest you to subscribe personally for me it's one of the best sources of interesting articles about how does netflix handle their workloads so they uh had a cassandra cluster in the beginning with approximately 50 servers i believe something like 45 or about that and uh guiding more and more and more servers into these clusters so basically going from 50 to 300 they meanwhile uh managed to get amount of client rights successfully written to more over than one million brides per second and what's the main point of this research that's not a surprise what cassandra can handle millions and millions and millions of writes per second simultaneously just give it enough powerful servers add them into the cluster not a surprise uh but that's the main thing here is this line is straight so if you want to add more servers it will go again straight it's a straight line and there is no overhead on adding new servers as long as your data model done right and you know what rex i'm going to say that again we have a workshop about data modeling for cassandra yes right so we have a free workshop for you to know how to build cassandra data model done right advanced data modeling for cassandra and what really matters is take a look this linear scalar linearity is the shared responsibility if you don't think what you do just throw some data into the cluster let it run then you can get this linear scale up you have to learn how to reach that first and then as you do everything right you will be good and your linear your scaling will be linear uh one point you can be uh you can make experiments when you are flying a boeing in the airplane simulator like microsoft uh flight simulator you can do whatever you want and you can try to do any tricks and it's the same with cassandra running it in your testing environment you can do whatever you want but if you're going to go to production if you're going to make to have your real clients working with your real deployments you know what to do yes we have workshop workshop for vet and even better we have something better when workshop we have a full course for developers we have full course for administrators quite a long one at the academy.datastax.com and they are free they are sponsored by data stacks to you so you can get your education and then later certification for apache cassandra and that's really cool so don't make a mistake you can make tweets in microsoft flight simulator but don't go to production cassandra cluster without proper education it may be dangerous so visit the academy.datastax.com first and that is the exercise for scaling up and down or actually considering time i believe we will be scaling only up because it is very very easy and we just do not have to wait to do it is exactly the same so we won't change a lot so basic idea is for us to change the size of the cluster and i will raise these size we can do it with configuration files or using helm upgrade command but frankly speaking i do recommend you to go with configuration files infrastructure as a code and everything can keep your config files uh in git so you will have versioning over your infrastructure and configuration and that's the best approach to understand what's happened after the rest and change so let me switch to my browser so hey there are you right uh first thing i have to understand hey there are you yes is what i want to understand the current size of a cluster if i will ask helm if i will ask helm to get manifest for kid sandra it will be huge so it will take many many many many many screens because configuration of a cluster is actually quite big there are a lot of knobs and levers but what matters for us is if i want to hey what's going on let me oops so that's not what i want i will go outside but let's get to this user i'm using cloud instance as you may remember fights and give me a moment login [Music] good ah by the way if you have ah of course it was a wrong password so take a look if you will use uh cloud instance uh from me not uh civo instance uh there is and if you don't have uh experience with linux we have a lot of people who say what i'm typing password and nothing happens something wrong with your instance mostly probably guys with no prior linux experience when you type your password linux doesn't show your password it's completely fine now i'm pasting my password enter and i'm in okay i have to reconnect oh my god what was that on the good side you don't have to install anything with our cloud instant you just need to use our cloud instance and shell is in the browser so everything is installed helm cubesat is here okay good so let me get back i'm first thing i'm going to do is not scaling yeah but scaling up and down right i want to get the understanding of my current cluster so i will get size for kate sandra using helm and there is a plenty of sizes but what size what matters for me is size one this one means what we have one and only one node running we already know about that because well that's how it goes and meanwhile right oh describe describe of course describe yeah so you see again quite a lot of information here about our data center now i'm going to change this data center what matters for me is what i'm going to scale up so we will have more servers located on different workers so we will go for it id is very simple i will first change their configuration file as i'm using uh cloud deployment i will go with katesandro.com so it's going to be quite easy i will take i will take for example kids under yamla file and here we have data centers dc1 and size 1 and rex one with the name default which is enough for us i will go to two state save it and i will go for the upgrade command and so on it's so you know it's so consistent right you know if you update any of the values all that you're going to do is you're just going to do the helmet upgrade command because what it's going to do is it's going to use the new values right and no matter right whether you're doing the size or whether you're changing the names you know things like that it doesn't matter right our setting heap size you know all of them were pretty much the same right and so i go here i go for helm upgrade kate sandra using configuration file kate sandra yama and it will take a couple of seconds and my next comment will be watched [Music] where is it by the way oh okay that is here we go right okay and we see what there are some changes uh what matters for us is this one k200 dc1 default stateful set one so the first one is running already for half an hour but the second one was just started it's the new stateful set which is being initialized at the moment and it will have soon two containers running one container for uh management api and one container for cassandra and we can take a look uh on what's going on at this point so if i go for 50 here get notes and hit nodes we have some workers here and if i go for cubesat get boards on oh oh my god uh what does recommend to give this white output um yes yeah right yep thank you so notice an interesting thing take a look stateful set xero runs on kind worker free stateful set one runs on kind worker just kind worker that is not a coincidence but intentional scheduling them as far from each other as possible so in case of something goes wrong if one of the workers ours will stay available so they are located on different workers on intention of course and goes back to the high availability part that you were talking about right you know you want to be yeah yeah exactly even if one drag fails you're still going to be able to function reasonably well yes and we see what's going on with stateful set one it's in one on two management api starts faster than uh cassandra that's for reason it's much simpler than cassandra note but within some more seconds we will have a stateful set of two servers running and meanwhile while it's being started i will go to uh set up cassandra part to take a look at the server status so i will get my password i will i have passport next oh sorry i have password i will execute commands to get the status but i have to update your password okay so again uh kubernetes commands can be quite long but the idea will be the same uh okay it's done i was too slow i wanted to show how it starts up uh but it's joined at the cluster already i was too slow uh okay it's restarting so we will see it soon uh we could have seen it in joining state uh but so it should be um uj up and joining but i was too late it's already uh join it and we're starting the second one hey and i believe it will be there in a moment so i don't want us to sit and wait for the uh no tool status i believe we can go further while kate thunder cluster is doing its job um what's going to be the next uh rex what's going on so my suggestion is let's uh skip the um backup restore because we really don't have time for that and uh the repair yep and let's jump right into the multi-region um you know if you do have the video queued up and you think you can yeah okay you know what uh let's walk uh let's run through the slides quickly and uh that will be mostly enough so just uh yeah because you need yeah you're right you know because all all that we're doing is follow the instructions so it's a good idea so let's do that yep yep right but take the first part okay sure okay and the backup and the restore essentially all that you're going to do is again kind of you can you can you can notice a trend here uh you initially what you do is you set up mineo uh you know which is a way to have this s3 kind of layer on top of the different infrastructure humanities infrastructure you're going to use and then you install a backup which is going to take a backup and think of it like a snapshot right you know that's that's exactly what you're doing um and and you can do it on pretty much you know a number of different storage engines um because again we are using something that works across those different engines and how do you you know you back it up and then how do you restore you again do a helmet right uh so so you'll see so let me walk through these steps uh although i will not walk through the step i will just kind of um follow along with the instructions right so so let me open this and look up backup okay so you can see here what what i do is initially start with adding menu okay so once i'm doing uh done with the minio then i added medusa which is really a way to do backup right and it provides the secrets and you know you have the access key id the access secret and so on and then you can kind of look at the secrets and then what you're going to do is you're going to create a backup right so how do i do a backup is so i i've created some data i've done this exited this shell and then i installed the backup the new backup this is the name of the backup right and i monitor to make sure that it's done now i come back in delete all the data and then i'm going to restore it how do i restore it so i do the restore test okay and then i restore it from the name of the backup that i just created right so so the backup name is backup one and what is the cassandra data center name and and that's pretty much all that you need to do and and when you again go back and look you would have gone back to the original state that you were in when before you deleted it okay so so it makes it very easy to use um and and you know again kind of follows the same helm philosophy um and and be able to provide a unifying layer across these different clouds and different infrastructure that you're going to use you might you might be sensing a common pattern here right so okay um do you want touch repair uh uh sorry again yeah yes i repeat this do you want to um do repair yes i don't want to do repair but i want to go through repair slides quickly sure uh okay so i will present and i will catch the screen [Music] and i know that the multi-region demo is just about seven minutes so i think we'll be good with that yep yep good uh so idea of repair is very simple take a look then you know what hinted handoffs already are ready to protect your cassandra cluster from cross node inconsistency that is great but they have limited time to be applied by in the current configuration it's by default three hours so if node recovers within three hours you will be good automatically but what if it doesn't first of all you can of course raise this uh graceful period time um on editing the configuration but it's not really recommended or at least we don't recommend to go too high in these numbers auto magic self healing is great uh but there are some situations like if your node for whatever reason was down for three days i mean like happens sometimes right uh can you imagine the amount of hinted handoffs to be streamed uh to this node like when you have like a million of writing operations per second it's going to be tremendous that's why this graceful time is set to three hours and for some deployments you actually want to decrease it not increase it then but still okay if note was down for three hours and one second how do we recover from this case so there are different approaches some uh recommend to decommission the node and bring it back as new which may be good good choice but the general idea if some data wasn't recovered is repair mechanism repair mechanism has multiple triggers sometimes you schedule a repair which will go and check for them inconsistencies potentially sometimes repair is initiated automatically again when a query coordinator notices what some data received from some server was actually outdated so again there are multiple layers of defense and repairing mechanism initiation repairs is the method to keep data across cassandra cluster in sync and it's important to run repairs on the regular basis because on high clusters with a lot of flights consistency may degrade over time if you don't have repairs as a veneku marchella said cloud database architect at netflix without repairs your database is hopefully consistent not eventually not fully but hopefully and that is the best uh statement i've ever heard about repairs so yeah without repairs your database is hopefully consistent so you there are some repairs what will be initiated automatically and some repairs you have to initiate on your own i just want to show a general idea if it will work for me in the moment right so v power cluster uh kids under we have a tool installed by default which is called reaper reaper was originally developed by spotify that's not a mistake thanks spotify great job and reaper helps us to schedule and manage repairs so in this case i i won't spend a lot of time in reaper but you can see what a caver is a ripper we can add a new schedule uh we can choose the cluster and key space we want to repair who will be an owner let's say alex what will be the start time and interval let's have it weekly and i will add this schedule and this schedule is active but it will be executed at some point so i want to run it right now i run it right now and repair run is in progress so i can go to repairs and see what my repair is happening right now we've created 20 tables to cover and it investigates token ranges step by step and see if there is anything to repair and if anything is wrong then uh consistency will be recovered automatically and that is great so first segment is done and we are going to go uh for uh second and third and so on and so forth and we see what no fails were registered which is well quite expected of course so um reaper deserves its own quite a long uh description oh second segment was done already thank you reaper i just wanted to see what a repair scheduling and things are also automated here and deliver it to you with kate sandra so you don't have to install anything for that it's already there that is the point and there is an exercise to run repair i just did that you've seen i went to reaper and started that and there is a multi region kate sandra last demon before we go to the game so you stay with us for three hours don't quit now after this multi region demo we will go for the game and you will win some prizes only the best of the best because you stayed with us for three hours learning a lot of new things so give me a moment so there are a couple of people who are asking me about you know usually there is no persistent volume claims um you will have to install the uh the appropriate storage class um and and you know um i think somebody was able to get around mini cube by installing it uh earlier version of kubernetes uh if you can please submit a pr and let us know it doesn't work on the latest version and and we'll see what what's going on there um right i'm just kind of looking through you know any other i know that some people had the consistency level one pop up every now and then uh what you can do is you can either delete and and try again or you know kind of just do an upgrade and and it should fix it okay okay so i'm ready to go for the uh multi-region demo which is one of the best i believe thank you let's go hello and welcome to this brief demo of multi-region cassandra based around kate sandra which is basically cassandra and communities as you already know cassandra is immune to the failures in fart zone and keeps on taking we are taking this one step further with multiple regions this walkthrough or demo is based in gke but the idea as with anything kubernetes that it's actually going to be multi-cloud this will be a little bit forward-looking and is based on the idea of how the cache kubernetes operator is going to be replaced by the kate sandra kubernetes operator but we also show how it's working today there are few details like networking sharing secrets etc that need to be done manually and i'll kind of walk through that as we go along so the idea is really that the cassandra seed nodes in the multiple regions are able to talk to each other via some networking magic and really most clouds enable this with the concept of vpcs so let's get into this a bit the idea is that cassandra is going to be spread over multiple regions and to make the install seamless so to make this happen we have a cat sander operator that essentially is going to install kate sandra on multiple regions or you know multiple clusters in multiple regions and then you know a way to talk to each other so this slide talks about how the networking is enabled and how the gate sander operator enables the respective data centers to talk to each other or respective clusters to talk to each other this slide kind of puts it all together which talks about the kate sander operator and also the cache operator which is not going away and is still being used to install cassandra on the respective clusters [Music] so this is kind of the high level overview of what we are going to see in action today uh remember we don't have the kate sander operator yet but we're going to leverage the cash operator and i'm going to show you some steps that i had to do manually to enable this to happen so with that let's dig in and let's look at the demo so the first thing i'm going to do is look at the different clusters i have access to and you can see here um that you know i have two central one and west one um both of them have uh kid sandra installed on it okay so let's do a quick check on the pods okay and you'll see here the different components uh that are running here okay so let's quickly switch to uh best okay which is the other cluster and kind of do the same command as well okay we look at the different parts and you can see here prometheus you know stargate um and the data centers itself which are running um on the other cluster okay so how did it you know i enabled this is let's take a quick look at the values.yaml file that i used in the install and that kind of gives you an overview of how these respective data centers were installed so you can see here there are two data centers and the critical part here is the seeds so what i did was took the seeds from the first cluster and plugged it into the second cluster and that's pretty much all that you need to do um so you can see here bc1 is central one and dc2 is west west one and the two are able to talk to each other via these seeds the networking is another aspect that we'll have to get into so to look at the net networking let's look at the clusters again okay and this is more of a console view and this is the first cluster right and the most important thing here is that it's running on a particular network called rns network right and you'll if you dig into this a little further okay you can see here that actually is um has access to the uh subnet that the other you know k standard cluster is using so so essentially that's how the two are able to talk to each other in in one kind of a virtual network so to say right um so if i go back to my kubernetes cluster right and look at the second cluster okay you can see that it's using that um that same subnet and is on the same network as the first cluster and that's how kind of the networking happens and all of this is explained in in one of the resources that i'm going to point to in a second so that's it for the demo um one one last thing that i probably want to show here is the data centers in action so what i'm doing is i'm running the node tool and and hopefully if everything is working right you should see um that you know they are they are running so to do that i first have to set my cube context so i'm going to go back to i have to set it to central one and now what i can do is i can run the same new tool and like i said you know if everything is working fine you should see these two data centers up and running so you can see here dc1 and dc2 dc1 is central one and dc2 is west west one uh and they are basically talking through the sea nerds so that's it for the demo i just want to point to some of the resources if you want to do it yourself the blog kind of goes through more details but if you're interested in a more over general overview of cate sandra we have a workshop at kubecon but we also have some recordings uh that you can kind of look through um it's available on kate sandra workshop on github and then of course if you want more um information kate sander itself including being able to install it to multiple clouds or being able to install it locally you can go to kate sandra dot io and with that said thank you very much for watching this brief demo okay i didn't realize that that had gotten a haircut in the middle so that's funny thanks everybody for pointing it out yep so that is cool because multi-region deployments are one of the most complex in relational database worlds especially when you start to think of something like active to active deployments and this question just simply doesn't exist in cassandra world because it's always active to active uh great so what comes next i believe our attendees deserve to have some swag some prizes uh okay so we have almost 100 of participants after three hours that is like a dream team so let me speech appreciate the patience thanks for taking the time yeah that is that is incredible we will be ready for swag just get ready with your mentee stuff right right and boom so i'm sharing and sharing steering and what matters now you have to jump in to maintain so don't forget you go to mandy.com42 and enter the code 42541711 or just scan the qrs code i'm as i'm showing at the screen at this moment um but i hope you are already there so once again mentee.com enter the code 42541711 easiest way to use mentee is just to open it on your mobile phone and uh answer the questions there while keeping your uh brow your zoom open so you can see that because look at zoom because zoom might be a little bit late right zoom might be a little bit delayed so just look at your mobile phone or your uh whatever device you're using yes yes speed of your response matters so if you want to be in the best of the best leaderboard so you better watch indeed mention but i don't think we will have a huge delay today so let me see i see what people are joining and that makes me happy ladies and gentlemen we are in the very end of the workshop and there are many dozens of people ready to fight that is great thank you for joining i see 63 i'm a bit curious there are over hours maybe they don't want to have any kind of surprises just give it like but i will be 30 seconds okay uh if you want to join there is always an instruction go to mentee.com and use code 42541711 if you answered our setup questions in the beginning that will help you to use mentee you already know maintenance interface although it's not really complex so 70 give me 71 give me 71 and we will start immediately i like it alex oh yeah here we go all right we're going to go now yes everybody do now okay let's go so ladies and gentlemen answer fast to get more points how many masternodes does cassandra require at least three at least three per data center enough to maintain consistency known cassandra is a masterless system watch out alex is a tricky guy he asks some tricky questions yeah i yeah i have some not really easy questions and boom it looks like some of you weren't really listening to us cassandra does not need any masternodes because they does not exist in cassandra terminology cassandra is a decentralized system with no single point of failure no master nodes if you're familiar with peer-to-peer systems that's the core principle of the cassandra cluster so right answer is known cassandra is a masterless system not free not free for dc no way enough to maintain consistency so many people gave the right answer but who was the fastest test yeah okay i keep shaking was the fastest cool if yeah cool with 989 points that's a very sorry result and black on the second place with 30 points difference that's not a lot and then hey cedric london cedric employee yes yes cedric you are a data stacks employee and you're still on the third place how is it possible you have to be on the first one that's okay okay so let's take a look question number two so answer fast to get more points yeah go beat cedric don't let him have a price partitions data is copied to every note address locators prove the mail i'm very curious if you've paid the attention to what we discussed today it was a long story three hours but we gave you the answer and partitions right partitions that is the right answer most of you made it not using address locator i don't know what is it at all it's just like it doesn't exist in cassandra world and the answer data is copied to every note is obviously wrong take a look apple is one of the most widely known companies it has hundreds thousands of cassandra servers with hundreds petabytes of data can you imagine where cloud costs if they go to copy data to every node it's first of all it's simply it's not possible second of all it's going to bank to make bankrupts even of apple so no partitions partitions not data copy to every node let's see how he's doing hey cedric is on the second place oh man ravi hey all right you made it right cyric is down to four let's bring him down further yeah like don't let him get your prizes keep them for yourselves single issues first place with 1 900 points ravi fastest this question with two points difference to the first place and blair is also only eight points difference to ravi that is a great job well done keep it coming next question question number three answer fast to get more points how do you scale cassandra database how do you scale a cassandra database add faster hardware increase the scale factor add more nodes stack nodes until they reach the desired height i like that yeah i mean that's my favorite way to scale cassandra i usually i can do it all day stack those and the right far right answer was add more notes first of all scale factor simply doesn't exist and second of all what you meant was replication factor what defines replication not scaling so right answer is add more notes and we have 27 people who gave the right answers 27 people from all over the world and [Music] nicely no mistakes by leaders uh single oh no no no what's going on we gotta bring him down you uh stinglishes you have only four points difference to cedric you have to take him down and we have a new name which is a brandon brandon barajas very good job top three and ravi ravi you have to both of the ravis actually you have to fight for the place in the top three yes let's move on that's question number four answer fast to get more points a standard database can be deployed on aws only any combination of on-premise and cloud provider only one of the following on premise aws azure on gcp or a life raft in case of emergency well maybe we have some arduinos why not but the right answer was any combination of on-premise and cloud providers right cassandra is platform agnostic and vendor agnostic you can run it everywhere thanks to open source community apache software foundation and many developers putting their efforts into building such an incredible software yeah and and since most people are kubernetes you know uh developers are operators here i write for them putting it on premise and every cloud is is a natural answer right yeah so right hey take a look what's something something just happened here they together throw out celery from the top three and that is a great result he is out of the top three with single issues fastest brandon barajas and ravi first of two ravis on top of the leaderboard that is incredible but keep focused like he is still very close yes and that's a question number five so answer fast we get more points docker container is image of software storage on disk lightweight standalone executable package of software file use it to configure a docker instance something to store fish in then coming back from a day on the board ah we didn't discuss it today but you know what it's the cube con after all and most of you made it right right docker container is not an image of software storage on disk and it's not a file to use it to configure a docker instance so there are multiple different definitions but let me see oh my god we just lots lost in delicious oh no that is that is that is okay they made it to the top two places that's incredible and brandon barack is still in top three don't you think stingalicius can still come back i think it's pretty cool i think you see that well that's not really close the difference is like around 700 points that's quite a lot but i believe there will be some more mistakes by the leaders yes so using those three takes maybe he still can fight don't give up and take a look familiar name now black with the fastest answer recovers from his mistake on the previous questions okay and we are getting close to the middle and super fast to get more points in docker in docker how do you enable persistent storage of application state state service volumes persistent file layer you don't persist storage storage doesn't exist nothing is real nothing i like what said which is the last options are crazy and the right answer was volumes notice we here refer to plain docker not kubernetes not openshift no nothing just plain docker in docker you enable persistent storage of application with volumes not with the state service okay and i like it how seven people support what nothing is real i kind of can understand this point yes but now let us see the leaderboard okay ravi uh managed to answer i see cedric fifth fastest answer on the fifth place wow and valentina achiva made it to a fourth place which is a great result and driving ravi are occupying the first places that's quite interesting and single issues is on the eighth place okay at least he didn't mistake let's see question number one the second half now so so everything could change yeah right yeah in kubernetes what is a port a worker machine in kubernetes cluster a set of replicas a group of one or more containers with shared storage and network i honestly have no idea which is technically can be right answer if you do have no idea but we won't accept it sorry because there is a right answer uh right here okay it was easy pod is a group of one or more containers base unit of access in kubernetes and worker machine in kubernetes cluster is a node not port so most of you made it but who was the fastest today let's see who's fastest is things changing in the leaderboard ravi second ravi made a mistake that will bring him okay so cedric is back in place climbing up blair is very close it's like a fifth place stingalicious it keeps climbing it's the fifth place and ravi brandon barajas and sergey klongan are doing the top three with valentine or valentin sorry not sure on the fourth place getting very close to get to the top three like let's see five or six answers right you know questions to answer so yeah i think it could all change yes sure okay and that's going to be question number eight so answer fast to get more points in kubernetes what is a service a program what runs in the background a policy what describes outgoing next net traffic and name it abstraction what defines a set of pots something you order in your room at a hotel i'll go with the policy of elimination no okay well it wasn't easy service is not the policy and service does not describe outgoing nest our neck traffic and that's not the program what runs in the background in kubernetes services and name it obstruction what defines set of bots and lord balancing and rooting for them so brandon and valentine are making mistake oh that is that is okay stingalicious is on the moon and vasco gave the fastest answer cedric is back again and ravi's still holding the first place but yeah is doing very well okay so players recovered really nicely right yes that's a great job question number nine answer fast to get more points kubernetes operator helps create a custom image extend the types of application what can run on kubernetes deploy volumes ensure your phone calls get rooted to the correct destination that's a hard one i expect a lot of mistakes here oh no no you still may surprise me right right kubernetes operator work is to extend the type of application what you can run on kubernetes indeed and make deployment of face application simple and that's where you saw kind of like data center um you know the cassandra data center so when you did a cube cadillac you could get all that yeah great so oh that is interesting now because ravi made a mistake and now cedric london is fastest again on the first place what the hell yeah but now you have to take down cedric and ravi is on the fourth place with brandon barajas on fifth oh well that is interesting now that's question number 10. close getting close yeah data stacks cassandra operator describes what network traffic is allowed for a set of pots represents a customization of a particular kubernetes installation automates deploying and managing oss apache cassandra or dc in kubernetes uh data stacks cassandra operator is a support engineer who helps you with your deployment okay good so no data stacks cassandra operator does not represent the customization of a particular kubernetes installation frankly speaking i'm not completely understand what this answer means although i wrote it but the right answer is cassandra operator automates deploying and management for apache cassandra or dc in kubernetes that is the right question that's the right answer and ravi secondly for both looks like blaze is going to climb up yeah no not yet yeah it's close fastest answer but still but now vasco is in the fourth place and brandon barajas is just some points behind okay ravi buffa ferravis are still on top 10. and that's question number 11 13. three questions left three questions left and i feel like all of you are getting nervous right now so let's see what will happen in the end answer fast to get more points what is the name of a service what automates repairs pixel reaper cast corrector equalizer [Music] hey i did my job well you see very good right the right answer is reaper cast character doesn't exist as well as fixer and equalizer at least not in the context we are working with today so let me see the leaderboard okay there are some changes looks like cedric was slow and blair takes the first but now just i want those stingalicious vasco and brandon barajas and all the others to keep fighting to overtake cedric he doesn't belong to a top three on this leaderboard that's for you question number 12. so answer fast to get more points what would you use for backups backups of yeah yeah yeah of course backup at ranger stargate medusa i don't need backups anyway uh well uh if properly configured cassandra cluster you may not be afraid even of disasters like real disasters but that's still better to back up your data to avoid possible mistakes and here the capacitor doesn't exist and stargate is another tool and it's not for backups and medusa is the right tool to schedule the backups for your cassandra cluster i went through this pretty quickly where we did the medusa secret and all that but people are paying attention yeah except frederick so yeah cedric didn't pay enough attention and he gets to the third place we've seen glitches welcome back to the top two that is great result blasting delicious cedric and vasco are now the best and actually brandon barajas are the best candidates to get to the top three and we have two questions left oh sorry of course we have one last question last question last question it will define everything it will define everything everybody's ready you know what to do what is stargate cassandra configuration tool data api layer with multiple apis a tv series it's a secret technology i use it to get on earth oh now you will know my secret okay so wherever to write answers it is the data api layer with document rest and graphql apis and it is a tv series indeed so that is the right answer in this case stargate is not a cassandra configuration tool and yeah it's kind of maybe a secret technology i use it to get a nerf that brings us to the final leaderboard and looks like cedric decided not to join or maybe made a mistake too tired after all he doesn't know what matters yeah looks like looks like uh so we have black at the first place that is incredible he was like eight or nine or something and then slowly climb back right wow he was in the beginning uh on top and then he made a mistake but he recovered and got to the top of that took place that's what i really like the most is the ability to focus and recover stand up again if you fall okay then stingily juice with the same story yes lucky 13 for all of them right yes yes yes and finally vasco who wasn't on top during the workshop during the most of the questions but uh keep consistent uh good answers and used the mistakes of many other who was too much in a hurry and made it to a top free isn't that incredible results so blair single issues and vasco please make a screenshot of your winner's screen and send it to where is my chat uh rex could you please paste a email for yes jack thank you so make a screenshot of your winning screen first three places blessed and delicious vasco make a screenshot of your screen send it to jack dot friar at datastax.com link will be in the chat in a moment and i have to say following if you are on the top three you definitely have something to be proud of you made great result if you are in top 10 there were many dozens of people in this competition so that's still great result better luck next time we run two workshops per week usually sometimes even more and we have games on a lot of our workshops so just jump in next time youtube.com datastaxdevs we will be happy to see you there and for those who are not on the leaderboard but participated in that take a look our prizes are amazing but let's say that's not ferraris or villas so uh you can't survive it i'm sure but what matters you stayed with us for three hours you learned a lot of new today and now with your skills you can proceed with your learning be a better version of yourself better engineer a better application developer or whatever your job is and finally you can have better salaries better job positions and so on and so forth so that's much more available than data stocks in short let's say thank you for joining us today and i have two more questions before we proceed to the next slides first how likely is that you would recommend this workshop to a friend or colleague hey looks like we made it quite well thank you for the positive feedback i know there are a couple of things what could be improved and we will work to deliver a new version of this one with a better experience to attend this but still thank you so much for the positive feedback uh now i will keep this slide open uh so even after the workshop you will be able to write some comments what did you like the most what should we improve any open feedback uh it will be great to have your answers and thank you so much for answering while meanwhile we are switching to wrap up and very last words cassandra kate sandro dot io it's the place to get together for all the people using kate sandra sign up for the newsletter participate on forum join our discord live chat tweet and find us at twitter with name nickname kate sandra and finally the main repository for everything is github.com now i've seen what in the beginning there are a lot of people who are not certified for apache cassandra definitely makes sense uh as you attended this workshop we you get the special exam voucher with 100 discount and two attempts for that certification so with our academy.datastax.com you can get through their preparations for only for free and then with this voucher you can get for the certification again for free there are currently free certifications available cassandra developer cassandra administrator and kate sandra specifically uh workshop's resources are all located at github.comworkshop and of course all the documentation is available on katesando.io don't forget to for catch us on discord if you have questions we will be happy to help um if you interested on uh to get even deeper like very deep if you are real kubernetes expert and want to get deeper with that you may join cassandra kubernetes special interest group with cassandra operator discussions and so on meetings i'll be weekly past meeting videos are published at planet cassandra on youtube and agenda in minutes on apache cassandra that's more for already kubernetes and cassandra professionals so advanced level let's say and a very important point there is a special kubecon talk this first day october 14 how to put database in kubernetes with our very own jeffrey carpenter book author courses author and one of the best cassandra experts uh you uh definitely may want to attend these don't you don't want to miss this session yeah and and one of the nice things if you go back alex is this
