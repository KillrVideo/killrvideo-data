    "text": "hello everyone I'm Aaron from data stacks and today I'm going to take you through using the data API with hcd all right let's go all right so going to start out in Mission Control here and I'm going to sign in now if I have a look at my clusters I know that my permanent waves cluster is my hcd cluster and you can see that it is indeed running hcd 1. o.0 um you'll also notice that if I focus on my ento data center um that I have the data API enabled uh which will be important for this uh demonstration as I've said in many of these other videos be sure you've exposed the data API on Port 8181 you'll also want to make sure that you build your clusters token specifically in my case you know I need to run a uh Cube control command to uh to get mine and it uh responds with uh with this data payload um but the idea is that you can piece it together by specifying your token as the word Cassandra colon the base 64 encoded username colon and then the base 64 encoded password um so the whole thing kind of comes out something like that um important to note but you will need this for the next steps that follow so now if if we have a look at uh Postman here you can see that um I already have my URL set and that is the IP address that um is exposed for the data API service on my hcd cluster now you note I'm going to follow it with a with a slv1 on the end which is also important additionally you'll want to set a few headers of course you know you have the standard um accept content type of application Json you want to make sure those are in but from the last slide that I showed you want to make sure that you take your token and put it into the value field here now the first thing we want to do here and you can see that I have several of these um methods like like pre-made here um the first thing we're going to do is create a namespace so we're going to start out with the create namespace command I'm going to make sure that command is in double quotes I'm going to add a colon um so I'm going to say name default keyspace when you're working with the uh the data API and a lot of the clients that we've built out for Astro DB the default namespace if you don't specify one is default keyspace so that's what we're going to specify here just to be kind of on the safe side all right I'm also going to want to specify um something for options and in our options um this is where we're going to specify our keyspace properties so I'm going to say replication oh want a colon there not a semicolon and we want oh got to double quote that class and we want Network topology strategy um again just like we would in dsse or Cassandra um and then we're going to specify a replication factor of three for our Entre new data center just like that okay now if I did this correctly um it should create that namespace hey we have a 200 okay outstanding all right um so now that we have our namespace let's go ahead and create a collection so in the next one here um this one's going to be a lot simpler I'm going to start out similarly with uh with some Json and I'm going to use the create collection command and with create collection the only property that I need to specify is the name of the collection and I'm going to call this one albums just like that oh you'll also notice that I updated my URL here to pass the name of the namespace um actually in the in the URL um so let's go ahead and send that through okay so now that we have our collection created let's look at getting some data in there so the first thing I'm going to do is use this insert one command um so I'm going to start up just as I had before insert one and when I use a colon there I'm going to create a document inside of uh braces here so we'll say document and then the properties of our document uh I'm going to use title and we'll say 2112 and for the property of band we'll say rush and for year um we're going to say 1976 just like that all right let's try that out well there we go so we've inserted one document into our albums collection um which you'll notice was added on the end here of our URL um and in the response here we did get a 200 okay uh but we also received the ID of the inserted document so you know let's uh let's let's test something out here and we're going to just going to copy that and we're going to do a find one here instead so let's start that out with the find one command I'm going to specify a filter all right and inside my filter I'm going to say uh we want to we want to check for the ID column and then we're going to paste in our ID right there let's try that okay um as you can see by sending a find one with a filter of ID equal to the ID that was returned to us from our insert one uh you can see that we do in fact get our document back so excellent that worked all right so next we're going to insert many now I have this one kind of created ahead of time I I have a whole bunch of um you know albums kind of listed here from from a few different bands um so we'll go ahead and we'll insert those in there we go and in this case you can see we get a whole bunch of IDs back um one for each document that was successfully inserted so now let's go ahead and build the get by band uh method here um and to do that uh it's it's going to be similar to how we built our find one so I'm going to start with this but just say find um instead of the the find one command that we used um and then let's say we want to build a filter just like we did before we're going to filter on the field band and we're going to use the equal operator and we want to filter on albums from the band Rush now I will send that through all right and as you can see we got our 200 okay and we received several records back um so it looks like this all is working okay um let's pivot here a little bit and actually build an application which uses the data API and all of this data okay um so here inside my Java project in Eclipse um you can see I used the uh the spring boot framework to create a new web application um I'm using vodin for the front end and we're also going to pull in our ASB Java client um and it's actually going to be able to connect to the data API that's hosted by your hcd cluster the main View for the web application is pretty simple um you know I'm adding in like a like a search button um you know a way to show like the list of bands you know a way to show the the band images and you know maybe some of that other other data as well if you look over here um I actually have the images named after the albums just minus all the spaces so that's how uh that's how we're going to match these up um without having an album image field if I go ahead and look at the controller that I've built here you can see that we're pulling in some things from the spring framework uh we're pulling in some things from the uh you know Astra Java client to uh to help us build this all out um and if you remember the filter operator that we used was the equality one and we're going to pull that in too cuz we're going to we're going to need that as well um so if I look through here you know you can see I'm I'm also pulling in my uh my token and my um API endpoint um kind of similarly to uh to how it had things set up in Postman now I have three methods here that I need to build out the get one album get albums by band and get all albums uh let's let's take the easy one first we'll just do get all albums um so really this is pretty simple all I'm going to do here is return now you notice I have my collection here uh defined as a private variable in this class um so I can just say collection. find just like that and as long as I have my default collection or my yeah my collection set to albums um in the default keyspace this will work just fine now if I wanted to get one album you know let's just say that um you know we could a return and it's just going to be collection. find by ID and you can see it's brought my Alum ID parameter um into there already so that will work just fine and similarly in get albums by Band um we're just going to return ah going to return a collection. findind similar to how we did for get all but inside the find we're going to specify a filter um we're going to use that equality operator and we're going to specify the field of band and then as a second parameter we're going to pass the band parameter that was passed into this method um right there okay so that should do it for our application nice and simple let's go ahead and run this okay looks like our application is running out on Port 880 let me go up to a browser and say Local Host 8080 there we go we have our DS albums application running um you can see over here we have a complete list of all of the albums that are that are in our collection this is the result of the uh the find all that we did um and if you remember we actually did that inside of Postman as well and the idea is is that I can go through and click on you know any of these albums listed here and it'll show the detail so this is actually a map that's keeping like the uh the album IDs as well as the album titles so when we show the titles here and then click it sends the ID through to get album by ID and then I also have it set up so that we can search by band name um in which case it will send whatever text we put here to the find albums or get albums by Band so I can say Pink Floyd and say search and we have our four Pink Floyd albums that are that are in here like the wall momentary laps of Reason Dark Side of the Moon and wish you were here I can also search by Dire straight and yeah we get love over gold and communic and brothers in arms and you know just like we we had an example inside of a postman I can also search by Rush and um yep there's moving pictures and Clockwork angels and of course 2112 so yeah this is all working and it's all running on the data API in hcd for more information head on out to data.com product SL hyperconverged database hcd here you can find all you need to know about hcd including documentation and downloads thank you and have a great day",
