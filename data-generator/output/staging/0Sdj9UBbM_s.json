    "text": "okay welcome everybody for this new learning monday series uh mondays is all about you to learn we tend to do hands-on we have external speakers speaking of which today it's my pleasure to introduce visa hi hello so he will talk to us about kubernetes building kubernetes native apps because now when you build apps you really have to be focused on okay what should i how should i uh build my application the kubernetes deployment it's not that easy you know all the resources that kubernetes should should handle and how to provide parameters and everything he will explain you all that today but maybe can you please introduce yourself so hello everyone again my name is sevelot but the third one is seva that's how i known to my english speaking colleagues uh so i'm working for over 10 years in it field and we started with kubernetes quite a while ago and since that i got i lost couple kilos and sweat it a lot and today i'm gonna share some stuff that i encountered during my professional career with you guys okay so the for this session i will sever deliver the content i will read all your questions note the question and i will go back in the end of the presentation asking all the questions just to have fun okay and from now i will simply disappear like that and let you the flow so thank you so great okay what let's start so uh we gonna talk today about building cloud compatible applications of course this is very huge buzzword but not really everyone understand what it means i think i do so i would try to share my experience with you today and let's see what this will be about so we're gonna go let's say in historical way so we're gonna observe how internet and application development look back in the days and how demands to web development as we are in web development field are growing and how do developers are coming to solve these new challenges so today we're gonna take a look not only at development uh but also would take a huge deal of um our attention span to infrastructure layer because that's quite important and that's where everything like kubernetes compatible application is growing from um and let's go ahead and take a look there's some info about me which i guess not that relevant for you just just take a brief peek and i already told something about myself so i won't be delivering much more words in here okay let's go to the fun part so before let's say in around 2000 uh developers were mostly building single application based on some huge framework like jbos or something like symphony framework if we're talking about php or some framework that allowed you to deliver stuff that user sees as well as the stuff that runs the business logic on the background i won't be delving that much into structure of monolithic applications probably if you were working in it field you met a lot of them almost every application that's written 10 years ago or 15 years ago is a monolithic application that's no doubt and what does it mean for us is all the logic are stored within the same project within the same place probably split by modules if you're a good developer uh probably not if you're a bad developer but still it contains somehow within the single project and uh usually this project has one connection to some external service so something like database or some more specific service if you're doing for example we were doing some telephone calling so we had the connection with ata but it doesn't matter so this is mostly a single application packed into a single piece of code running everything starting from what user sees to what backend developer sees in the background so these uh old ways required some special not special but uh they required some infrastructure because your code cannot just run in vacuum so uh that required the node infrastructure to require some infrastructure setup so you have the physical machine uh with the unix-based os usually that's unix based because unix is much more flexible than windows but you also have the windows servers that's just my personal preferences so sorry for making you biased guys uh it had some replicated disks because ray technics are quite well known you do you set up two disks uh for let's say 100 gigabytes and one disk is storing data and another disk is just a backup so you're working with that as a single disk but they're being replicated so if one disk is going away another is taking over and all this um all these metal all these uh devices we're running with your single application uh codes container for java it's a jar container for php it's a php container with a php code with some interpreter doesn't matter so that was delivered highly manually by uploading files via ftp ssh or some transfer channels or even in the worst case scenario we had some special trained guy who was just picking up the physical uh data drive and inserting that into some usb hub on the data center and of course this was uh backed up by web server not not necessarily because you could have it also built into the physical machine and it was running traffic through in some cases you could have database split to separate machine just to increase redundancy so if you have let's say fire in your data center you could at least copy that and do not lose all the data on the single machine and making your business at risk and they were usually connected by network meaning that it was just a physical cable between two machines with some ip addressing and routing so nothing special you can you can assemble such stuff at your home easily just connecting two computers to each other yeah that's that's that's very old way that's that's the most obvious way of delivering software that's how users uh sorry developers and administrators deliver that in the past but also we should take a look what internet was in the past that was quite a lonely place i'd say so um according to the data from internet database uh in december 1997 which is 23 years ago there were just seven million people connected to the internet all over the world mostly in north america but also traction here in fraction there in all other countries and these people you can imagine right you have an earth globe with six billion or seven billion people that simon you had just 70 million people on the internet which is not that much um and also these people in the internet are not that widely presented as of now they just presented with a speed of 56 kilobits per second for those who didn't use motives back in the days who was so happy to be born in 2000 or or later i will explain so you had the telephone you have the landline you had some special device that was connecting to the landline and sending some uh highly analog signals encoded and due to a natural limitation of this landline and it was very very slow so it was like you could have a page with the text that just been loaded over five minutes also multiplied by the fact that your computer is quite slow and also in case someone wanted to call they couldn't because they they picked up their phone and they heard some weird satanic sounds from directly from hell so also according to cisco measurements uh there was just 150 terabytes traffic flowing internet per month and i mean that's not that's not that much uh we are having uh hard drives and data centers that are bigger than that nowadays and also of course you didn't have that advanced technologies and websites were very very lightweight and users also were not that demanding they didn't require a high speed on the internet because uh and high speed for websites loading because basically you had a computer which had the problems with just moving your mouse cursor and also they didn't know what is a good internet service is because back in the days you didn't have amazon you didn't have google you just had a lot of enthusiasts uh home pages of some sort like uh hello this is my homepage i love flowers i want to share that with all the worlds and then two photos of flowers that were loading for ages because they were one megabyte goddammit huge and they couldn't be loads at the time and also there were no smartphones right so users just had a huge stationary computers at the best laptops only very rich people could afford those so there were not really that much people in dirt in the internet spending that much time in the internet yeah so i mentioned that norma's on no google of course correctly craigslist was there craigslist was always and nowadays internet is much more crowded place so there are 5 billion users in the internet in 2020 meaning that more than half of the earth populations are spending some time in the internet or most of us are spending a lot of time in the internet also with a higher speed because of the broadband connection broadband connection uh is widely spread all over the world not only in the first world countries but everywhere also elon musk wants to to run his satellite network which would provide us huge shadows everywhere including some everest mountains and then stuff also you're using your smartphones a lot and smart force are doing a great deal because now you don't need to go to the computer to go to some dedicated place you can just take a look at your smartphone and of course we are having amazon and google we are having some really really advanced services that are really advanced and providing services to users and users are got used to this outstanding really outstanding quality of service and moreover uh websites should do some heavy calculations if you want to stay in the business if you want to analyze if you want to make sales you should be able to deliver metrics you should be able to deliver marketing data and there are a lot of tools for that and a lot of tools that require computational power and requires some certain approaches to that also we have fast computers user now demand a high speed because a user can click every icon on their computer which will work right away and they demand the same from the website because for average user it doesn't make any sense uh to divide them in it's in his mind so that led us to new challenges for software deaths now we are we should know that five billion people in the internet right in in the in the worst case scenario 0.0001 would require your services and still this is a lot this is like 10 000 people 20 000 people but they won't know about you in the single minute so what you need to what you have to do is uh you have to build up a tiny little system that would deliver just the main functionality and then be able to really really grow up fast because uh the the advertisement that is being provided through the internet can acquire new users in no time let's say facebook advertisement can have uh one percent of conversion uh per 10 million impressions that meaning that hundred users will come to your page every second and you need to be able to react to that also you should be able to adapt let's say your website was crafted with uh or your web service was crafted with some thoughts in mind that you figured out later are not correct and then what you do you should like be able to instantly switch it instantly deliver the new version of website no more guys running with the physical data storage between data centers that won't work anymore and businesses businesses also have changed they now need to test new hypothesis and if if before testing new hypothesis meant that you should do a new release print out cds or print out floppy drives even if we're talking about 95 but now people are just like we need to deliver this feature next week and deploy it everywhere and people should get access to that instantly also when devs are picking up some technology some database drivers some network drivers they also should be able to really really be able to switch them in case they will figure out that this is not the way to go and of course for developers business makes hard and strict requirements to deliver code really really fast before before 2000 delivering code really fast meant you could develop and deploy feature in two months because you have some time and now it means that you have to deliver features every week or in the worst case scenario every day and with all of that mentioned you should still be able to be secure because hacker script kit is there and mounts are also increasing we had some very romantic movies that uh that led people to think that they can hack everything so yes let's let's continue to let's continue and take a look to the approaches that that were picked up on both application level and develop and deployment level so i will start with this service with the server's infrastructure and i'll take a look at what do service infrastructure per se would provide it's very important for you as a developer to know that as well because your responsibility is now not only writing code but we'll talk about that in a few so we had a virtual machine so we had virtual machine service meshes we have still bare metal service i would talk about that a bit later and we had configuration management tools and containers that allow c-subs to or devops or system administrators to deploy your code faster and also it allows you to have some flexibility that you also should know about and of course for developers uh the huge step forward the huge the huge leap i would say is continuous integration and deployment systems let's start with uh virtual machines what virtual machine is so back in the days in 72 one smart guy figured out that uh your computer is like not a 72 of course but he thought that your computer can be so powerful that it can act as two or three different computers with different virtual systems with different os with different layers of hard drives and that where first virtual machine kicked off as a software concept before that it was purely software in 2006 into provided hypervisor technique uh integrated on the hardware level which of course always faster so virtual machines really started rising in 2006 so what it basically is is you can create multiple machines with different operating systems on the single machine called host machine and also you have some certain of some certain layer called hypervisor which manages all the resources so technically you can create one weak machine one medium machine with different resources let's say you have two gigabytes of ram you can create one machine with two with 500 megabytes of ram and one with the one gigabyte of ram depending on your tasks and also they will be completely isolated unless you do some special procedures you cannot access host machine from virtual machine and of course you could definitely guess where i'm leading to so this approach became very popular amongst hosting providers because you're not risking your your bare metal server your your physical server anymore you're just creating a virtual machine this virtual machine is isolated it's secure it allows you to flexibly control the resources and you can uh provide this to your customers so your customer requires some small little service a server and you don't need to buy this small small tiny server you can just create a tiny virtual machine on your huge powerful server and that would act as it and uh that's uh how a virtual machine came to hosting providers in a really fast pace i think it started in 2006 and 2007 i could already buy a dedicated server based on virtual machine so how how hosting providers are organizing that is via service meshes so it's very convenient mechanism you have a virtual machine you have a set of virtual machines you have you have a special machine or or software standing in front of them because virtual machines can also be spread over multiple uh hardware pieces right and that where it controls which user has access where and which user can do what on its virtual machine and how do we roads uh customers for these users to some certain uh to some certain machines basically you can consider that as just a plain fair firewall um if you don't know what firewall is it's just a tool that limits uh some certain connections to somewhere like you cannot connect uh to report 80 on your computer but you can connect to port 53 because this is where your ftp server is running or vice versa or you have your guy forgive me you have your counter strike server somewhere so you open this port and your internal firewall is blocking every other connection disallowing any people who can hack you or or your your system to not to do that so that's how service meshes appeared and then let's talk about about dedicated bare metal service from hosting providers because they didn't go anywhere so as i said before all servers uh used to be bare metal service in the past so that's basically the tiniest unit of server infrastructure that you can have so it's always a single tenant because it's basically just a machine with os installed and that's just it's just a machine like you're like your home pc or any server you're working with but this is just hosted on that server so that's the plane that's the most plain connection to the hardware meaning that uh of course it's not um it's cumbersome and tedious for a system to host everything as it does with virtual machines and therefore you're dropping a hardware costs and but on the other hand you're increasing administrative costs because if your virtual machine um acts weirdly you can just restart it and it will raise up in in no time but with the bare metal service you should physically restart the machine probably involving some special trained guy with who would just flip on the switch and flip it uh back again but yes it's still it's still valid a lot of companies are using that especially big companies because it's the most computational power of every approach possible and you can also use it for some special tasks like mining bitcoins or or serving some special databases with the special computations because it can has some special hardware because virtual machines are not that good they're just a common uh they're just a common hardware machine so they cannot handle this special hardware and of course people in the data centers are not doing that by hand let's imagine you have a thousand uh web servers you have 10 000 of virtual machines you have everything so and if you will just have a system administrator which you just type in comments for each machine that would be quite counterproductive like you got 10 000 servers you should set it out set them up in the rack which is not actually that tedious but then setting it up one by one would take human years and also sellers or some good pet specialist that's how configuration management tools were invented uh they are just uploading the configuration files uh which is basically just a plain file enumerating the commas that you should run and uh that's how you can set up 10 000 servers at the same time if you have some system administrator amongst us or some former system administrator they will probably have a smile now because they definitely know what is this all about and we are as a developers not that interested it's just for me it's a good bridge to come over to what follows next so docker and kubernetes a big buzzword since it was released in 2010 from google by the name borg which i definitely like more than q more than talker uh because that's uh that's a star trek reference never mind so that's not a so a lot of people think about docker containers as some sort of virtual machine which is just just more fancy it's not so what is it is you have a system you have a thin layer of isolated libraries and these isolated libraries are communicated with this machine hardware directly and also docker was built perfectly only for isolating virtual machines for isolating machine environment from each other on a on a software level so that's more like a very programmatic tool to to be able to be secure and also it has some features that we will talk about in a few um so we can we have on this channel uh my colleagues from data stacks are having an amazing presentation of what docker is and how to learn docker and i would highly recommend to each developer to delve into that it's not that card it's not that complex but it will moderately increase your uh cost on the market and also your knowledge and of course your fanciness as a developer because if you have this hashtag your two head two head two heads ahead of every other developer so let's talk about kubernetes because this is a next step to docker uh after docker was released uh that wasn't that much so it's just an isolated container the concept is as simple as that but what happens if you need to build if you need to build some mesh of services like let's say you have a database which is separate you have your one of your application which let's say sending emails you have another application which connects to database fetches some data processes that and sends email if necessary how do we connect them how do we test them we have docker which allows us to separate our environment which also allows us to emulate the same environment we have on production services but how do we connect this to a network how do we how can we test this how can we have a very convenient way of scaling multiple docker containers so kubernetes gives answers to all of that so this is a tool that that is basically just a docker container manager so what it does it controls the docker containers it gives them some comments like run stop restart die be deleted and so on and so forth and has some nice api uh that allows developers to also to also control the kubernetes itself and of course these docker containers inside the kubernetes and also what kubernetes is is the tool that can that allow allows you to build a network of your hardware and unite this into one docker into one kubernetes fleet that you can control as you were on the single machine which is very cool feature and widely used by the hosting providers and these so-called cloud services so we're basically when you hear about cloud service that's basically kubernetes it will be there by some other name maybe but that's basically it and also kubernetes along with docker brought the concept known as a horizontal scaling so basically you have two types so vertical scaling is something when you're just adding a resources to a single application which is good for monolithic applications but resources are end and the resources have an end has an end and for that you should and considering that you should know that you cannot grow grow endlessly and you should at some point think about how people can be split between the multiple instances of the same applications because you can't buy more machines you cannot buy faster cpus at some point so and kubernetes gives you incredibly easy answers to that you just buy a new machine new server you set it up with the tools i enumerated previously and with these tools um and then you just you just add this to kubernetes and say kubernetes scale up more in kubernetes we just use this machine so this led us to modern approaches so as i mentioned developers are now able to control kubernetes api so this is an even even bigger extension to infrastructure as a code meaning that you don't need to run to your data center anymore or do some physical stuff with it you just run the sets of commands sitting at your convenient office chair or your convenient rocking chair if you're at home and then you just you were just able to to control everything and of course along with that kubernetes defined uh rules for writing efficient applications because it's not that easy and of course you are as a developer it's your responsibility to know that in case you're working with a cloud infrastructure so let's take a look at that so how do we build in kubernetes native apps that's where our story of sweat and tears is kicking off it has some logical parts that i try to split as much as possible but i would say inevitably mix them up so sorry for that guys in advance if you feel insecure or you don't understand everything just wait a bit or just don't hesitate to ask questions in the chat so cedric is there and he'll be happy to answer them so let's start with the development preparation what is development preparation that's maybe not the best term but this is this just means that developers is responsible now for preparing a docker image csops and devops is a new thing it's a new branch in infrastructure and there's a new profession which requires a lot of skill but basically the the task of preparing a very basic docker file so your application will run in the environment that it needs so with all the libraries and all the dlls if you're running on windows installed if needed it's it's it's only your task so you should be able to know how to write docker file you should know a little bit how docker works internally you should test it locally because running docker locally is very easy on each system including windows and so and you have all the power and all the tools and you have a lot of material on the internet but preparing docker file is not easy because i never met a developer who just like started with docker files who doesn't has doesn't have an experience with with the clouds and who could prepare a decent dockerfile from the get-go so it doesn't work this way usually these dockerfiles are huge and cumbersome and hard to read so you should definitely get a finger on that and make some muscle memory even to to be able to write them so also that means that uh deployment pipeline increases because develop deployment pipeline complexity increases because before developers were just producing code without thinking about docker and kubernetes on the and they were just the guy who was deploying this to production service with an ftp build and there was not that much to think about and now we have very high standards of um of ivory tower development like developers are doing code developers are creating merge requests and then team leads or reviewers are approving this merge requests leading to containers being built then you have a health chart which is a tool for generating kubernetes deployments and then it generates kubernetes deployments and goes to kubernetes and also kubernetes does some magic inside so for developer it's now insanely hard to track everything and this honestly this is a theme for six separate um presentations but we're just about observing here so just keep that in mind if you're being hired to a company or you want to be art in the company that uses cloud infrastructure or docker or kubernetes the pipeline would look like that so let's uh let's switch to actually application itself how do we write code for this application so the first thing that is worth mentioning is application should be stateless i would emphasize that not none of these rules is carved in stone so i mean when i'm saying that application should not be stateful should be stateless that means that uh in 99.9 percent it should be stateless but you can have some certain approaches as certain problems where this this this just doesn't work so just keep that in mind okay so let's go to stateless so uh what does it mean application should never ever store any session or return data inside the docker container uh and the moreover inside ram that comes from a fact that docker containers are highly ephemeral uh which means the docker container can die at a at any moment and in kubernetes environment it happens all the time like let's say one of your servers in the network went down virtual machine went down or something happened part of the network connection got lost and then kubernetes what it would do it would redistribute your deployed application to other services but of course it will kill the application first and if your application is saving some critical data within memory it would lead to to bad consequences because it won't be stored anywhere it won't be flush to disk it won't be it won't really be saved because uh because hard drives that because the thing that is treated as a hard dress inside the docker containers uh it's just just some temporary storage that would be erased once a docker container is down and um you will ask me like yes we do not we we won't be able to store any data in the container how do we do that so you establish a connection to something that called stateful layer or persistence layer and stored all the data that should be persistent in that stateful layer like database or you can also kubernetes allows you to mount some some some hard drives some physical or virtual hard drive which will be more persistent so you can store it in there something like images for your website and stuff which should remain there for for for a while and also please keep in mind that user session also belongs to also belongs to persistence so it should not be stored in your machine because let's say you can have multiple machines you remember about horizontal scaling right you can have multiple instances of your website and then your website will store user data on one machine then user clicks somewhere and goes to another machine and then session is not being stored in there and then user feels uh like he's been logged out to this website so that's a very very bad pattern each uh each of your application instances should communicate with database and not share data between each other i'll emphasize again this is not curved in stone you probably encounter over your professional career patterns or situations or cases when it's not should not be like that but this is a general approach this is the first approach you should think about i will give you one a short example on how we had our problems with our applications so we had our application that was counting analytics for user website visits so it wasn't just counting so it was uh it got user data it looked for some matches said it was processing data it was combined recombining the data and then it was storing that to database so when we just ran it we of course considered that application cannot store stuff directly to database because database would be a bottleneck or should be scaled a lot and that's how we came to conclusion that each application should store some some certain visits like 50 and then then flash them to database and uh that's um how we decided to go with that and uh on the next slide i will show you what it led to so that's basically what happened with our with our deployment so two applications were counting these it's one counted 20 another counted 30 did some processing and then node the kubernetes the kubernetes restarted our one of our applications and another one continued counting and just counted 13 flash data to database and database contained 13. cool we had some inconsistent data in the database and then when marketing guys went there and compared our data with what our partners gave them they said that this is so this should be 15 or 30 and this is just a very bad example of anti-pattern in kubernetes network so we allowed our application to be stateful uh we stored some data we searched some in turn data before flashing that to database and that's where we failed so you will ask me of course how can we how can we organize that in a better way and we will discuss that in a few so let's continue to the next point in my presentation which is scalability so of course i mentioned that already as i said i'm mixing these topics up because there is no particular order for that and you should just as a developer keep in mind that you would have horizontal scaling that's what how kubernetes was designed that's what uh clouds are needed for that's how modern software is working and your application would not exist on its own so you should actually think about about what the consequences would be of application not existing alone in the universe and the first thought that comes into my mind when i'm thinking about that is um is we should not design this in a single tone pattern so your application should not act as if it's alone in the universe it should not be greedy it should not do any exclusive logs anywhere uh to to be able to start because that's a contradictory to what kubernetes states and also it should not require any external service to to be to to be up before application starts up so normally if your application requires some external service and this service is not yet up application should not just hold it the application should say fail i'm failing i'm restarting and then when external service would start application at some point would just connect to that and that's it that's how kubernetes is working failing is quite okay your application can be restarted five times before external service is available that's also quite nice so don't hesitate to kill your application on each on each requirement unsatisfied that much better than just holding something in the background and relying on on on the developer skills to to be responsible for some checks on this application and also it may be a good idea to open idle connections to database let's say so you don't waste resources for reopening them but it's generally a bad pattern because your application can be terminated and you will lose your open idle connections and if you're not managing this properly and this is quite hard with all the modern database systems you would have dell connection on the database layer and as we remember this is not easily scalable so i will give you an example about what have we done in our company so we had two applications it's the code is quite equal i mean not quite it's equal so this is just the two different instances of application two containers to docker containers running so first of them we decided that we were quite good idea to lock the database so we don't bring any inconsistencies during the startup because application was done some job on the startup so um and what we had is the first applications this is run run it set the lock on the database it started doing some some stuff in the background uh like feeling in the database and then it crashed because it was restarted we remember failing is okay then another application instance started uh tried to acquire the lock could not because first application never released its log and then we had no running application at all without any real problems behind so that's what you should avoid and uh that's uh how you should not write your applications except for the very rare cases when you're reading need to set some locks just for data consistency but for that you should definitely know what you're doing that's this this application crash is highly possible so let's uh take a look at responsibility split what responsibility split is so that's closely connected to another topic that you can meet everywhere in the internet you can hear about it on all the development conferences this is already a de facto standard in development so this is a micro services of course microservices and everything every everything that i said before about standalone applications and stuff is mostly about deployment micro services because um because developing monolith monolith are also able to live in kubernetes environment but all the kubernetes and cloud services were designed for microservices so it's very tempting to actually just start from microservices because that would basically you will be doing on your daily basis on your job or you're already doing that but i do recommend to read about that a bit and think about that because this concept is not very easy per se um as it seems so it's there is a very good book from sam newman called building microservices i mean generally most of o'reilly books are very good but this book i can definitely recommend to read it gives you very nice introduction very nice um overview of what microservices is and then on listening to all the conferences you would be able to imagine what microservices are and what they represent and let's go to responsibility split so responsibility split is is basically the the concept lying in foundation of microservices your application should do just one job so if you have your system which does um user provisioning which does user logging in which does user doing a purchase which does sending emails which does i don't know delivering avatars or serving images this is highly likely monolithic application and if you want to serve it in a kubernetes you should probably split it to email sending service to uh image provisioning service to user login services and so on and so forth so if you have within one instance multiple multiple goals or multiple responsibilities you can think about uh creating new containers uh with the specific function let's say if your application should run uh user logins and send emails and you don't see any necessity of splitting this code you can just split these to two docker files to docker containers one of them would be logging users another one would be sending emails and of course the concept that docker brings us as well is limiting resources so you should think you should not just rely on the server capabilities you should you should never say that i need four cpus and three gigahertz or six mega six gigabytes of ram for my function that's highly likely not true and you should think how we which bare minimum resources your system can run and with which bare minimum resources you can deliver you can deliver everything so this is also a hard topic let me know if you're interested in that i have very good cases and we can organize another mandala learning for that so i'll give you an example we had our applications doing migrations so this was a responsibility application was doing some application job and was doing a migration to the database and uh what we ended with is application was three instances of applications were trying to start migration and even though a lot of migration systems are designed to exclude concurrency it's not reliable and it's quite hard uh topic for software development as well so we had some some inconsistency in the database because a lot of applications were trying to apply the same migrations and one applied it for 50 percent and that's it for for 20 and the last one could not apply anything at all so it was not that good it was very complex and then at some point we came to the conclusion that it's much easier to just divide applications to applications that are doing applications job and make a separate little container that justifies the migration so just only one source of truth no no no intersection nothing that's basically what um what the responsibility split is if you think that your application does too many job or these jobs are contradictory between application instances you can also think about single application instance that will do your job or multipublications that would search up in parallel that's what i wanted to say about responsibility split and let's move to startup and functioning section so that's basically very bad term for that i didn't figure out anything better but this is about how containers are being run inside the kubernetes so kubernetes is a very complex tool it's very smart too what it does it provides the necessary resources for docker containers that are specified on a kubernetes level and so of course kubernetes has requests and limits and request is a bare minimum resources that your branches should have somewhere free to run your machine that's why i mentioned the bare minimum resources for this machine and of course limits is how much this machine can can consume so this comes from a concept that you can have one server with 10 docker containers and the server does not necessarily have the resources for all the containers working up to limits but it can have some resources for containers that are that are temporary running at limits and then going down again or it can actually kill one container and schedule it to another service which has more resources if this container is constantly at limits and also how kubernetes understands that container should be dead or how container is responsible for serving a traffic or making its main function it has a readiness or a limitless probe concept i mean not or this end this is redness and laminus probe uh existing in kubernetes so what readiness probe is it shows kubernetes that when your container um is being able to satisfy this readiness probe it allow it is allowed to run traffic through this so there's basically a signal for kubernetes that your application is ready and it's ready to serve traffic and it can run traffic through it because kubernetes is also responsible for a networking layer we'll discuss that in a few as well so um it's your responsibility as a developer to define readiness probe it can be some some end point which kubernetes just just consume and if your endpoint let's say returns okay kubernetes decided yeah it's okay so if your application requires some database it will it requires some um service to be up and running you should check everything in this readiness probe and then then when everything is satisfied the application is is up itself it can send okay so this readiness broke this so this is important topic that developers usually discussing with the sysops before starting any development and lagness probe is much more simpler so it just states to kubernetes that this container is not dead and it should not be restarted so container can be not ready for for a while but if kubernetes sees that the container is not live therefore not responding to limits probe it will restart it so think about that as well maybe create another endpoint if you know that there is something in your code that can definitely go wrong and prevent users from from having um having your services uh that rather better to be dead right you remember that so just craft liveness probe as the bare as the maximum availability for your service so craft it in the way that it will respond in like bad everything wrong on each disturbance in the force so also the good advice that i'm giving as a as a senior developer or as a technical lead in my company is do not pay much attention to the language so and each conference you will definitely see this separation like golang is better than php or java is better than c or or something like that so it's rather better to deliver your service in the language that you know than just hunting for features or some better kubernetes compatibility from some other languages so just pick up the language you know just pick up the framework you know or the framework that you've chosen or a framework you want to know and just start developing so it's not definitely related to kubernetes but that's good to know and of course um grab all possible metrics from your container like your application is running your application has some internal modules and these modules can definitely have some numbers to measure so please do not hesitate to put them into metrics a lot of frameworks are already providing providing ready-to-use metrics like let's say my favorite spring boot is java framework is providing some metric send point where it just says that these many threads are running this many memories consumed now and so on and so forth so it's very nice to know and it will help you later on we will discuss that as well so and then you have to understand where bottleneck is most highly likely it would be a database but please do not focus only on that so just just plan your bottlenecks accordingly and think about them before developing an application more or before creating a kubernetes network let's take a look why i'm so focused on the bare minimum resources the here is some examples of closest not the closest but one of the biggest google clusters in europe in north europe so which is in finland and the pricing in there so you see that that's actually pricing even for for service that would never be restarted because these preemptive posts meaning that google will restart them from time to time is quite low right because this is just two cents for an hour what can go wrong but you should also understand that if you don't think about your resources you easily consume 20 or 30 cpu months uh just serving services uh just just serving your applications to the customers and then you are paying around 400 dollars per month just just for your applications to be around so this is also a nice nice numbers for business that they should pay the bills about and please do consider that that's why i'm i'm focusing on resources every developer should know what his application is capable of running on the bare minimum resources and what is capable of running on a huge pile of resources there is no so many of good talks or presentations on that that just comes with experience so your your older colleagues your most senior colleagues would definitely help you with that and we can also organize a short dev talk about that where we'll try to clarify what's meant in there so let's talk about persistence layer which i mentioned a lot um during my presentation so the persistence layer is a database layer basically or any any data storage layer so what you should know about that in most of the cases except our beloved cassandra the databases are stateful so that means the database is holding some state and that's obviously what it designed to to do and and even cloud prepared databases are not are not easily are not easy to scale up or down so these databases are hosted on two or three containers because we have redundancy for high availability it doesn't matter so you cannot just say that yes my database is not holding up i will just scale up new database horizontally like you can do with your application so applications can scale definitely databases cannot and when you're setting up a persistence layer within the kubernetes it would also mean that database would have also limitation on resources and increasing this would definitely require restart on database that's why they they of um duplicate it or even tripled over over the network layer so this is in my opinion which is not current installed we can discuss about that in the comment section or in my linkedin page uh is to be kept outside of kubernetes because this is where it contradicts most of the kubernetes patterns kubernetes has some stateful patterns but better to keep database outside of it and if your and your responsibility as a developer to think how do would you connect to persistence layer and how you would um how you would serve your traffic through so also good advice to give about persistence layer about databases is if your team is small and you really need some some low maintenance solution and you're ready to pay some money and you don't have any dba you can think about vendor provided solution a lot of cloud services including google microsoft azure and amazon are providing um already to use databases and you don't care about how they how they host it or how they scaled or how databases are being set so how backups are being set so you just use this database and you don't think about anything else it's quite expensive but for starter it's a good it's a good approach and at the end um concluding everything that i said and um also returning back to an example that i've shown uh let's talk about some architectural points so you remember that i mentioned the application that was counting visits so this this analytics application where people were going in and then some processing was happening on the multiple applications and then everything was stored to database so this is what we are calling event-driven systems so something in the outer world is happening and we're just reacting to that that's actually and efficiently in nature of most of the of the businesses in the internet amazon reacts when you're clicking the page uh netflix reacts when you clicking play google reacts when you're typing something in a search string so this is basically how things in the internet have been crafted and on each event you should act somehow and probably should act in a short time frame and it's highly likely that you require some some definite computations that that are quite long and that's where people invented publisher subscriber or pop sub architecture so the good thing about publisher subscriber is that uh you have you have some special pieces of software or even hardware i mentioned dedicated parameter service before which allows you to split the responsibility so your application as the gateway to the user is only responsible for forwarding clicks further so just assembling maybe doing some some slide computation and forwarding it to some something called q what q system is is um the special software which designed space basically sort of database which designed in a way that um you're pushing messages to that and from the other side you can consume these messages and it will keep it will keep track where on which message was consumed and of course it was started for some time and of course it's designed uh to have as high throughput as possible so couple of examples is a rabbit mq or kafka that's a software solutions that you can use to organize the queue there is a lot of them you can just google queue software and you'll definitely find something because this is a also a topic for a separate discussion and a separate presentation and then on the other hand on the other side of queue you have one or multiple processors so you see this horizontal scaling available on both sides which does all the heavy computations and stores the stuff and database that's a that's how most of the publisher subscriber systems are organized you don't need to do immediate heavy computation makes user weight you can just do just bare minimum that's needed uh to a user and um then you can just reprocess stuff later on another good example is um you are having let's say purchase button uh purchase includes um a lot of stuff like verifying user credit card uh storing the user data maybe sending it somewhere processing at logistics center and you don't need to do everything at the same time you can just make a note that user wanted this this purchase and then you can just process credit card you can process logistics you can process you can gather goods everything you can do by publisher and subscriber so let's say your application just publishes message this user wants this item and then it being spread over multiple processors that will just do everything further so your processing can take days but user would just immediately see that they're playing that yes we created your order it will be processed and delivered to you that's basically how internet how internet shops are working so let's go to the last point which is much more of of uh soft sysops or devops point but you should also think about that so you're you're providing some metrics as a developer but this matters should be gathered and processed so do not hesitate to measure everything in your application if it doesn't waste that much resources and it will help you in the future to go to production and find out what's going wrong and or you should also of course provide logs which should not be that verbose not in the development mode but some logs should be clear and allow you to understand what's what's going on when devops are sending you the some problems from the production services which you usually don't have access to so just just consider that just think about that a lot because this is the face of a modern software development and also if you're devops or you are about to make some some nice proposal to the devops uh just think about monitoring based alerts one system that we're using is alerta so what it does it gathers metrics not it doesn't gather it's it consumes metrics from prometheus which gathers them and creates alerts based on these metrics uh in the real time so let's say you can have uh some some monitoring system you can have your mobile phone connected to this monitoring system and something goes wrong on the software level you would be immediately notified so do not do not ignore this you should think about that early from the from the beginning and really be able to deliver some metrics on your application also do not forget if you're having a database or you're having this q system that i mentioned before they also have their metrics it's also vital to measure them because we're all people we're all human beings and we all make mistakes so something can go wrong not only in your code but in vendor code and that happened a lot also i mentioned we are not humans we are not we are humans we are not perfect and of course kubernetes is also a piece of software it also has bugs it also has bugs by itself and um and uh approach itself is not perfect as well there is no perfect things in our world so that's where we have some problems with the approach which i would um which i would conclude one by one so first of all kubernetes software is a software it has boxes any software does and one of the most prominent uh which were discussed in the community which caused the turmoil in the community are security flows so we had the run c vulnerability that allowed a malicious user to run c code on the container and expose a root container to to people that should not be in there and also get access to kubernetes network and we had another bit worse i mean the easier vulnerability is with uh api ddos so you could as read only user to kubernetes ddos api and also get access as a right user so that's that's that's what should we deal with and that's what how we should uh upgrade kubernetes every time some something like that is being found now there's also a maintenance cost right because you should track it also kubernetes as i mentioned before provides a network layer but there is the networking itself is not a easy topic and the way kubernetes handle network is not perfect in my opinion so it requires a really really dedicated person unless you just have one single net of boats and and so just one entry point everything other should be handled by specialist or at least consulted with a specialist that really working with that a lot and of course not you as a developer also kubernetes api has its own limits because uh also kubernetes stores some data persists something uh usually it uses etcd which is a sort of database for this and these databases also has having its its own limits so you should be careful because we had our kubernetes crashing when we deployed when we deployed a lot of applications and the traffic was so intense within the application network that our kubernetes crushed on its own so this kubernetes is cool fancy shiny but it's not perfect let's go to another point so now before applications were just working on the bare metal stuff you know that right so now it's it's working inside the docker container and docker container connected to host system in case of virtual machine um because very often kubernetes spots are being scaled on top of virtual machines to ease deployments and work for hosting providers and of course this is a huge um this is a huge buffer huge proxy between your application doing system calls directly to the hardware so this my this is one of my favorite pictures uh uh which is quite accurately describes how describes how it looks from the application perspective so do not do not do not throw it out of mind keep it in mind always when you are dealing with kubernetes so the most efficient way if you need the most efficient way think about bare metal servers and of course um every developer i don't believe that there are there any developers existing in the world uh with more than five experience in i.t field in a web development field that didn't do internal ddos attack but back in the days computers were slow servers were slow as well and this ddos attack could be reacted to within the human reaction time now it's not it's not possible at all so if you have a ddos attack it kicks off immediately what the uis attack is is basically imagine you have application one which sends some data to application two application to reprocess some data and sends it elsewhere but if you make it error in configs and accidentally pointing pointing application two to application one it will send some postbacks to application one application would reprocess them sends them to application two amplifying efficiently um everything and in some worst case scenario you can have kubernetes out of scaling turned on and then it will throw even more resources to this application efficiently increasing packet storm and that can lead to really really bad consequences so this is more of a human problem than kubernetes problem but just keep in mind and check everything on your application especially configuration files so these are sources that i use to prepare this to prepare this presentation of course wikipedia always always a great inspiration source mostly for stealing pictures but the rest it was also quite nice to remind myself about history of the internet and how docker works so thank you for being with me today i hope that was entertaining for you feel free to add add yourself or knock at my linkedin page i would be more than happy to discuss everything with you if you feel that i'm speaking or i'm quite contradictory to myself so feel free i'm i'm i will be happy to welcome you on the page now i'm giving the word to cedric all right thank you very much it was very useful um we do have a couple of questions and questions are keep coming uh we have kind of a couple of questions on cassandra so i would elude them or put them for later so first question uh and the first question is me actually you you show them the workflow to design an app to go to kubernetes and you put helm in the middle you know once the docker image is ready you put some helm build helm deploy and you know what i'm doing is really i do have my docker image then i move to docker compose to still work locally and then i use some tools like gcube or compose with ok to change from docker compose to deployments and it seems like having elm is better so what do you think yes so this is a cool approach thank you by the way for mentioning docker compose because i completely omitted that of course running kubernetes local is a is a bad idea because this is very resource consuming and not needed docker compose is easier and yes so when you're creating a configuration you can use compose which would just transfer this to to kubernetes appropriate format but the thing with helm is that it manages a deployment itself right so the kubernetes on its own is not designed with a very complex logic so if you're applying a new release you should do this manually you should tell kubernetes which container where uh should be put when it should be put with which strategy should it be rolled out one by one and should be just all containers deleted and restarted right so it's quite cumbersome it's easy when you're having one cluster or just one application but if you're managing a lot of them right like like we are managing 60 or 100 it's better to have some tool which would decide it for you and which will allow you to to extend this infrastructure as a code approach to deployment that's why we're using helm it's actually this sort of de facto standard in the industry because it allows you to easily scale up a lot of deployments and create a new ones with just the simple configuration files i would i would recommend i would recommend my my colleagues from kubecon that were observing kubernetes which were observing home chart features it's really hard to explain the home charts itself but definitely this is a way to go when you're having a huge deployment okay um you know the question is second question is also about elements okay on lm chart standard image are available how do we do our own custom image what is needed uh so i i need i need to refine the question a little bit right so a helm chart is is the thing that just contains docker image and docker images can be standard or can be prepared by you so when you're preparing uh your docker image you should find some repository service if you're using google cloud they have their own if you're using your own feel free you can use artifactory from jfrog or you can use some of let's say nexus because it's a free you set it up on a separate server which kubernetes has access to and then you just put the links to the home chart easy as that so when helm access when helm has access to this server it will just fetch the image and put this to kubernetes put the information about it to kubernetes i hope that answered the question that's how i understood it yeah i think i think pretty pretty convenient yeah this is yeah this is what i would do um [Music] i do have a question about stickiness so have you ever had to use some stickiness in your car you told a girl stateless or for that that would be the best but sometimes app needs to talk to dedicated child or anything have you tried something like that so um i did try uh dedicated sharding like like i i understand what what the question is so like something like google does right when one application is able to to access only let's say a shard where all information starting from a is stored and then b shared and so on so yes yes this is also state but this state is not stored in the memory per se right so you can have of course some state you can have some configuration but please make sure that this configuration is either can be easily recovered so you can you you have some stateful database which also stores um stores the state of each application where application can can know about its state uh something like um etcd or zookeeper so let's say your application is working like google you're doing a search you have a b c d e f g and so on and each application you're starting is working with some specific letter let's say your d application crashed then new application instance started it should go not to the uh not it should not figure out anything by its own it should go to uh to zookeeper and no okay zookeeper which three letters you have for me which charts i should access i can access d shared okay i will be the d application that's usually how it's being done so this what i know about stickiness also uh on our own experience we even having shared state between applications so we are having shared cash but i would also mention that shared cash if one application crashes it's not a big deal this cash can be easily recovered it's not the stuff that easy to lose so that's just that's just it yeah so i i agree and so christian keep coming about state food state food i think it's a tricker's party in in kubernetes but they also yeah sorry uh i also can see that people would demand probably help charts and stateful presentations in the future oh yeah think about that yeah that would be cool to have you of course so suppose we deployed our stateful application on kubernetes what to do if and now if a node goes down um yeah yeah that's a tricky question yes so um it depends um let's say your stateful application is a database crafted by you uh you don't love cassandra or postgres or whatever um two we're having on the market you decided to go with your own database so please make sure you made it high available usually how it's being done i will give an example of uh of postgres and also i will talk about cassandra from cedric permission uh so how postgres is doing that it has one master because all postgres is naturally limited by having only one master that stores the data and has another uh note mark as slave which is usually hosted on even another server another server that makes a lot of sense right another node so one node which contains master is just accepting rights and breeds and then duplicates the data over to to a slave and if a slave node goes down not a big deal on the new note it which should be restarted you have you have empty database which will be slowly recovered and if master goes down slave tries to understand what what needs to happen and then it just takes over master role it's of course backed up with a lot of service meshes so you should also have to have something on the network layer which will understand who is master now but generally this is the approach and please if you're doing your database please ensure that you at least have master slave replication and when you're deploying this make sure that first of all you're using kubernetes stateful sets uh which will ensure that it cannot be that easily restarted and lose mounted volumes and also make sure that you spread it over multiple nodes with them with special tool code teens and anti-affinity and of course cassandra is much better in that sense because it allows master master replica so you can have two notes acting as a master with some special rules for logical split and they would be consistently up to date and if one of the masters goes down another immediately takes over which causes the downtime because of course if postgres master is down there would be some downtime for your users which hopefully not that big and self-recovering yeah so this is how you have to deal with the stateful applications if you cannot do application stateless just make sure you have a lot of instances of state state for applications and they are consistent between each other all right thank you alright good good yeah good deep dive and swear as well i guess yeah so seek some question so first any documentation about docker image and nexus repository maybe i'll take this one very quickly so uh in this channel we had the four week series on cranet um docker and kubernetes and there we explain you how to build a docker file and how to push i mean build an image push push an image to a docker registry and so you can use the docker hub which is a public one or create your own you know just to reduce the bandwidth needed each time you push a new image it's not like really nexus repository where you would store maven artifact uh but you know it's on the channel really um docker field docker login docker push those are explained in the previous video yes i i would i would definitely say that i would recommend this this course i looked at with a lot of with a lot of fun i really like this course that's that's very good explained and also you can visit hub.com and take a look at the vast amount of applications there thank you cedric for announcing that sure um yeah so next question is um i don't know let's ask let's see so uh bernard asked that actually there's some conflict between simon tech and to antivirus and the openshift cluster so did you experience some troubleshooting with antivirus and kubernetes uh yes so actually as i'm as you can see obviously i'm running mac um i'm i'm i'm desperate user i don't have any antivirus but i managed to set up a kubernetes environment on windows um on even windows 10 which is basically user system it's pretty tricky right it's it is it's it is very tricky i just i just was paid for that otherwise i won't touch that i provided and all that stuff yeah i know what it is yes so so actually yes antivirus blocks um kubernetes as a potentially vulnerable vulnerable process because kubernetes works also in virtual machine sometimes and is opening a lot of ports for its own actually uh as far as i remember for symantec there is an official patch uh official like uh library extension which allows antivirus to work with the docker environment uh and kubernetes but my advice here is if you are running windows and you want to set up a kubernetes which is quite hard on its own i would definitely recommend not using antivirus software that's that's really that's really hard sorry if i couldn't help that much in here but i don't know that's already a good thing to know that seems like a patch exist and true so we are doing some teaching with kubernetes docker on linux windows and mac os and windows is always tricky we we we must provide some dedicated cloud environment most of the time that's yeah windows is conflicting with with docker when we want to go deep dive you know using kind or mini cube or you know any kubernetes local stuff make windows not really happy yes so i would really recommend using linux because in my opinion um in my opinion setting up these windows is very glorious deed but if you want to learn on kubernetes it's not maybe the best choice yeah so yeah i know maybe this this question is for you and i will take two more questions and yeah close at 3pm let's say my time so in five minutes so um next question would be um is it advisable to use vania kubernetes in production i think against probably cloud provided kubernetes like gke aks stuff or even openshift would you deploy your own k-test cluster and which version would you use that's very good question i mean all the questions were very good and make me sweat a little but but this question is very good in the sense that uh i i was i was stuck with the same one two years ago uh we were choosing over google cloud provisioning services or deploying vanilla kubernetes uh to let's say amazon web services because amazon doesn't have anything on its own so my answer here after after five months of trying is if you don't have a special dedicated teams a team at least of two people knowing that what they're doing i wouldn't go there because vanilla kubernetes is is a is easy to install but really hard to configure so you can really easily install cubelet volumes you can really easily install the master node but to make it production ready you need a huge way of trials and error even though we now have very nice configurations ready for kubernetes it's still not worth the effort i would in worst case scenario i would say open shift or i would go for google cloud engine because uh highly likely if you're working in a middle medium-sized company and you're probably just required to move your infrastructure there and if you work in a big company you probably have a dedicated team and then that's where they would decide this so i'm a lazy person that's a good quality as a developer definitely yeah maybe one last question is uh how to secure a kubernetes cluster is there a way to configure ssl for kubernetes like cassandra so so yeah when it comes to cassandra of course you can set up ssl communication in between nodes and for customer client app to connect you won't have the same settings if the app is running inside the cube cluster and can reserve the service names or outside and now you need to open port and use some ingress or s nice tricks to make that work so yeah of course you can make a cube secure and open port only on tls ssl with the proper you know ingress configurations also i would mention about security uh there is a concept inside kubernetes which not every developer or even every sysop knows about is secret keys so if you want to connect a database but you don't want to share keys with developers or exposed it anywhere you can use a secret container secret storage within the kubernetes which would provide the keys only when they are needed very good concept i would highly recommend that all right well um thank you very much we are at the top of the hour so thank you very much for being with us i guess you pick a couple of subjects you want to go more deep dive you will have some some some some documentation to read uh you always welcome if you want to come back please tell us it would be we would be very happy to host you again and share more love around those technologies and with that um see you next time we will redo the same session in a couple of hours for people living in america and such but until now see you next time bye see ya bye on the same page [Music] do [Music] you",
