    "text": "okay cedric so i think we are live great hi everyone yeah so hello everyone if you can see us if you hear us please write something to the youtube chat so we can start all good here hi all so many people today that's amazing perfect perfect we can hear you we can see you so that's great today is monday and many people say what monday is a bad day monday after like a weekend you have to go to work you have to do something and maybe you prefer to stay at home well we all stay at home mostly during this year 2020 very special year indeed indeed that's very special but we want to break this tradition we want to change that we want by monday to be your most favorite day of the week how come because of the data stacks man the learning that was the idea of this gentleman from paris sitting left to me yes yeah hi guys so cedric would you say a couple of words about the data stacks monday learning yes so this is a new initiative we are launching today we are starting with docker it's back-to-back z back to basis cover a topic that will talk to everyone just to get everybody excited about what we want you to learn and make the datastax family even bigger yeah exactly so uh as you know most of our workshops uh on wednesday and thursday are connected to the apache cassandra and clouds and cloud natives but we also want to speak about the more general topics like about the clean code code quality or i don't know maybe continuous integration and delivery and specifically for the next few weeks we are going to speak about docker why docker is the very acquired technology from now it happened to be not so long time ago but since year 2015 it grows bigger and bigger and now it's almost always the requirement for a developer or an engineer to know what is it how it works be familiar with that and know how to use that but data stacks monday learning of course not about only the docker so for next four weeks we will meet you every monday speaking about docker how to use that but also that's about very many different topics so we already preparing something special for you docker will take almost all of october and uh cedric do we have any particular plans to announce uh for the november uh you know what maybe we will run a survey or sleedo.com and ask everyone just to vote for what should be the next topic if we can cover it you know or a mentee with the five top topics we might think of you know rest api uh or getting started with one language or another let's see yeah definitely in general the idea is to make you our attendees better developers stronger as developers and meanwhile make the itu world software development world better in general because well there are some skills missing in the world of i.t we would like to cover so every week best instructors most important topics from engineers to engineers no marketing no proprietary software but only open source and engineers things absolutely free because knowledge and is priceless so next thing to cover docker containers these four weeks course we go from very basics to best practices so if you know what docker is in high demand but you don't know what is it that's exactly the place for you to be today and that's four weeks learning path it starts today 28th of september it will be over and 24th of october so four before full weeks four weeks four classes to learn new things but also you have your own homework to do assignment and that's very important if you're going to use docker for real you have to touch it right now starting today and in the end final assignment we cover four main things this week and next week are mostly for the docker fundamentals so what comes in the basics we start simple and when we start to advance so uh that's a very good fit for everyone even a beginner in a software developer in general third week will be application development with docker many companies have adopted docker but they are using that in a completely wrong way i tell you that's very serious by trying to use docker in the way how they developed applications before and that's wrong and they obviously do not follow the docker best practices so last week will be for docker best practices how to do it in the best way most secure way more convenient and simple way plus final assignment so what we are going to do over these four weeks you are going to learn a new technology you are going to become a better developer every week you go you attend the live class or watch the recording if live plus schedule is uh not the best feed for you we run every show every class we run two times this one is starting right now and second one will be in few hours for those who live indeed in our time zones which are those are lazy people sleeping right now don't take it seriously so we have the same run still life few hours later then you answer the quiz questions during the class try to be the fastest one because we play and give out some swag not don't expect anything too big but there is still some prizes to get and do the assignment after the class by the end of a course do the final assignment gain your get your achievement unlocked enjoy because well better developers get better salaries so that's amazing good and we are at the week one docker fundamentals and we are about to start what is docker so best question to answer today what is docker as some of you remember maybe very very many years ago some microsystems told about java think what made java so popular is write once run anywhere basically on any platform you can run a java virtual machine it means you can run a java application on that it's a little bit more complex than that i guess i'm not a java developer but this idea right once run anywhere is the really really great approach which was basically reproduced many years later by docker team in the form of built ones run anywhere everywhere but now not only for java now for basically every kind of a software application you can write in any language you can use and that's incredible and very short docker is a set of tools to build ship or transfer transmit and run any software packet with all its dependencies at ease and it really does what it says it allows you to build ship and run software on any docker enabled machine over the world and you doesn't have to install any kind of specific dependencies on your own machine for example as a developer advocate at data stacks i work with very different proto projects i work with multiple python projects i work with golang i work with javascript i worked with python again but in other versions and so on and so forth and if i would install any all the kinds of dependencies for all the kind of projects i'm working with my laptop would be seriously exploded after some weeks and there is no joke because there are multiple projects sometimes very complex and there are those uh everyone brings its own dependencies but what indeed i have on my laptop install it only docker because everything is pocket into the docker images if i need a project which brings some docker images i just pull them use them as long as i don't need them i dispose them remove them and my apple and my laptop is simply clean after that and i don't install anything directly so how it works we will see in a few minutes whatever we need to run an application is packet into the image and when we run the container based on the image it has all the dependencies within for us to use and dispose when we don't need them anymore and that really simplified my life so there are two technologies which changed my life completely uh source code version control namely git and docker those are two technologies i love the most over years and years and years in the software development what is docker docker is often confused with virtualization and ideas of virtual machines most of you know what's the virtual machines and virtualization in general are so you have a server you have a sometimes host operating system or if it's a server dedicated for virtualization you may have hypervisor directly on that and when you have virtual machines running on that every virtual machine is the standalone operating system like all the full application over full system running under the machine with all the required utilities file systems i don't know whatever system processes you may need and there are a lot of them so even when you run a small linux distributive um you still have pretty a lot of running processes like i don't know things like systemd or whatever you may need and as the things getting bigger or i don't know if you run windows therefore there will be more and more processes to handle so virtual machines allow you to run guest operating system over hypervisor or host operating system and that's great it was a really huge advantage when this approach was invented it was like breakthrough but it also has some downsides first of all uh well as it provides better isolation but it also provides some um first of all they are much more heavyweight so as you br you need to have host operating system you need to have guest operating system all of those processes are running and it all of course brings a huge overhead and it's fine in general because as long as you need strong isolation from one virtual machine to another and from virtual machine to host to host machine but for many of the use cases it was not the best choice but still a lot of companies were using virtual machines for example at one of my former projects we use it virtualbox and background to set up a developer's workplace and the image of a prepared guest operating system with all the tools required was around six gigabytes so it was pretty long even to pull besides the fact what it took like two minutes to start up containers work in a different way so idea of counterization is pretty interesting instead of running an operating system with inside the operating system and have your processes running inside the guest operating system so you see i'm repeating myself that's because yes there is a strong overhead containerization allows you to run guest processes directly as the processes of the host operating system in the containers so they are isolated from the other processes and system processes of the host operating system briefly speaking if you run ps to watch the list of processes launch it in the linux machine and if you run it with your virtual machine in host system you will see process of virtualbox for example but you will see no guest processes no applications running in the virtual machine because they are strongly isolated with the containerization and docker was originally based on linux containers lxc they will later replace it by their own module you run guest processes directly as the processors of a host operating system it brings a lot of benefits so containers are much more lightweight and they are much smaller usually if you do them right of course because there are still containers in images like one gigabyte or even more but usually if you do them right they are pretty small second point they are much easier to start so a normal container startup for a simple application which doesn't require some databases connection or over complicated things to wait is within some seconds sometimes even faster so docker containers are much more lightweight they don't bring their own operating system they don't need hyper hypervisor basically the docker service process is running alongside them and run them in the memory of the server directly as a processor of a host operating system they're much easier to manage by the price it always comes with the costs of the less isolation from the host operating system and our neighbors so there are a lot of security layers defending some containers from another containers and defending host operating system processes from containers but still there is a lesser isolation now there is one point um those containers still have some files and they will be i say they don't need guest operating system which is correct but only partially they bring their system with them but it's not running but the system files they may need to use and we will see how it works in the practical step of this workshop so can comparing containerization with virtualization is very simple the containerization is a much more lightweight provides a bit smaller isolation but by now in the year 2020 this statement is not perfectly correct because now security in docker reached some very high level and i don't know any kind of reports containing containers interacting with their with another containers or with a host system if you don't explicitly tell them to do so and therefore define it some security settings for them to connect to each other good and very often asked question is virtualization debt no virtualization is a great technology it will exist and it's in high demand and of course containerization is not the replacement for virtualization but there are some use cases then containerization is much better because of this lightweight thing it's always about the thing there are no silver bullet but there is a question to get a proper tool for some job you are going to do okay how docker works very simple docker is built to build ship and run any software at first we are going only to build and run to simplify the tasks for the first part of a workshop and therefore you have only two base concepts to learn what is the image and what is their container idea of that is very simple we build images and we use them to run the containers what is an image easiest explanation of what the image is is that it's a template so uh like an class in the object-oriented programming if you are into object-oriented programming then you can consider image is an object-oriented class so you cannot communicate with class directly on runtime but you can instantiate an object of a class and therefore container will be this object image is an immutable read-only template for containers you can build an image you can launch a container container based on the image and you can delete an image you cannot change image per se you can adjust change image but you can build a new image based on the old image this immutability is a very important concept because it really helps docker to perform very good in many cases because of the caching and layer transfer and so on but that's covered in the next workshops so i will not make a 2d dive but the thing you have to remember docker image is the template and you can run a container based on that therefore what's the container constrainer is an instantiated image a process or group of processes running in the container in memory of the host operating system as container is a running entity you can do more things than that so you can start container you can stop container you can run command directly into the container you can watch vlogs and do many other things you may have to do consider container as a dedicated space in the memory of the server or your laptop whatever you are using there you may have one or multiple processes running and you can attach to it and execute some comments then when i say attached to that many people start to think of ssh or tools like that although it's possible but usually it's much easier to do with built-in docker commands so you don't need to have to run ssh server within the container i will show you so as said if you are into object-oriented programming container is an object of a class how to build an image to build an image first of all that's not necessarily to build an image so you can use an existing image and the name in many cases that's the most common use case i will show it to you some minutes later but first i want you to build an image to understand how it works in general most typical way to build an image is to use a docker file docker file is basically just in for just a file in your file system called a docker file and it has a set of instructions you use to define what has to be in the container when we will launch which files has to be what uh software we may need inside and so on and so forth for example in this particular docker file on the left we see a setup a preparation receive a docker file preparing template for the containers preparing an image to work with python application as you could guess don't make a two deep dive into that because we will do it on practice in the real terminal terminal in a few seconds the main four instructions to build an image are these four from copy run and cmd there are much more i don't know maybe around 20 i think but the main four instructions are those when you build an image you always have to specify from so what will be the base image for yours you always need to have some basement or fundament for your building you are going to build and in this case we are building our application from the python base image which is a bit advanced step again we will cover later today then copy copy as an instruction to copy quite a surprise files from your machine where you're running docker build to the final image you are going to use run run is a command to do some changes in the image being built to install some software your application is going to use for example and then cmdm is the finally command your container will execute on startup because don't forget docker images are not archives by itself but pocket software and when you work with software you usually know what is going to do so uh with the comment you specify what exactly it's going to do on the startup for example if it's a web application it will start up some web server maybe nginx or something else and so on so those are four commands uh we are going to use today and you know what talk is cheap show me the code so let's proceed to the uh practical part and we are going to do it right now and to go with that i will open my terminal i will make it a bit bigger so you will see that hopefully hello world is the size fine can you see what i'm typing it's small it's a bit small to me okay i will make it a bit bigger good i hope now it will be fine good and we will start with something very simple i want to create a folder i will call it docker test and i will switch to this folder and let's build an image we are going to create our first docker hello world isn't that exciting so first thing i'm going to do is uh to create the docker file again docker file is just a file in your operating system so i call it docker file and i'm going to add some instructions into this file and again first instruction what's the most essential instruction for me is from from specifies the base image i'm going to use now i'm going to use any default linux image i don't know let's say debian or maybe yeah debian should be fine debian and i can even keep it like that and i will have my own image which basically will copy default debian image but well it's pretty boring and as said i am going to have it as a hello world so i will say cmd cmd statement specifies which command will execute my container on startup and it will be a simple echo hello world simple as that uh we had a question for you alex what is the difference between cmd or run in a dockerfile uh good question i will explain run in few minutes okay yep so stay tuned stay with us in general very briefly difference command when i run docker build when i will run docker build this command will not be executed that's the specification for a container to is executed when i will run a container based on this image and when i type run this command will be executed directly on build time not on runtime okay so that's the main difference run is to set up an image and comment is to be executed on the container it will be clear don't be in a hurry it will be clear in some minutes good so we have from debian command hr hello world and i'm going to save this file and as i have this file now very simple and small file just a hello world as hell overall should be now i'm going to build that to build that i'm typing docker build and when i specify where what exactly i'm going to build in this case i want to build a docker file located in this folder in the current folder docker test so i simply set dot to say it's a typical linux abbreviation for to say this folder sorry and i run that oh my god of course actually i'm a linux guy and i'm used to work with linux and oh you need to start talking i have to stay for uh my macbook i have to start docker but i just rebooted my laptop getting ready for this workshop sorry so it will take on macbook to start docker it will take around i don't know 40 seconds or something like that i'm using docker for mac so while it's starting two words to explain docker is based on the linux based on the linux container and that's still basically a linux system so on linux it runs natively no questions but if you have os6 on macbook like me or if you have a windows machine it's not so easy because linux processors cannot run natively in windows or os6 very clear so to do the exercises from today's class you will have to install docker for linux if you use linux docker for mac if you use mac and it get back yeah good docker desktop is running and docker for windows if you have windows if you have windows 10 home edition you may be in a little trouble because we're a pretty hard thing to install docker or windows 10 home but we prepare it we found a great tool for you to play with docker without installing that to be explained in the end of a workshop okay very well so let's move on i'm going to docker build dot docker build in the current current folder nugget and there are some things happening first of all sending build context to docker demon docker is the client server system so there is a docker daemon running now running within my virtual machine with docker desktop and docker client which is a console command line client which executes my commands in this case docker client sent everything i asked to build to docker daemon transfer it to its server first step step one of two from debian okay so i specified debian as my base image okay latest i will explain it in a moment pulling from library debian i don't have this image debian docker image on my laptop so it was downloaded pool complete it was downloaded and that's its id pretty long one download new image for debian latest and step 202 command hr hello world and finally successfully build and that's the id of the image i just built let's take a look at the docker images docker is my command to ask docker to do something and images is the list of images i have and wow i have pretty a lot of images here when i ask docker to show the list of the images i have it usually shows me multiple things first repository so the name of the image for example on the left side tag i explained soon image id when it was created and the size of them so as you see i just built a new image nameless it has only an id and i'm going to copy paste this id and say docker images grep put my id and that's my image which was built a minute ago and it has weight of 114 megabytes so okay now i have an image but image is not do something i can communicate directly i can build one i can delete one i can watch the list but now i want to run a container based on this image and you may try to guess how my comment will look like and comment will be docker run which says to docker to run a container and then i therefore have to specify the image i'm going to use and that will be my image and i have to scroll it a little bit higher so you will see the output and the output is hello world congratulations we just executed first very simple hello world we did for them uh videos in the world and you are going to do so to do so again as a part of your assignment later so that's great but as it's a hello world it's not really useful so let us take a look if we can do something better to do so well usually uh docker works with a long run in containers well not long long but sometimes running containers in our case our container just said docker just said hello world and immediately exited how to check that i will say docker yes um yep okay uh just for everyone to see you should um you know put the prompt just above you because you're in front of the prompt or you can add yourself on screen no yep you are right give me a second oh come close to me yeah you are right let me move closer to you thank you are you riding the prom yep yep now it will be better now we are shoulder to shoulder cedric oh nice okay put your mask on [Laughter] yeah uh well there are still four hours by car from my place to your place so i hope you are safe enough good yeah i can still disappear you know get back get back good so to watch the list of the docker processes i can run command docker ps and it's empty because my container just quit it's as long as the main process of the container is running container will be running as long as the main process first process process speed 0 so call it in linux quits container will be also quit quitted so how about to run something um longer running i will run thing let me switch to another folder very well and we have no yes exactly i will run this file so let's take a look at the next file i'm going to run and next image i'm going to build first one from this one should look pretty familiar to you because well from says which base image i'm going to use by the way i've seen a good question in the chat what's your favorite uh base docker image uh asked by um gerard uh gulen uh in general answer is very very cheap there are no favorite base image it very depends on the tasks you are going to do but in general i try to use alpine as much as possible because alpine is the minimum minimum the smallest distribution you can use for docker well not the most smallest but the reasonable smallest one you can use to build as small images as possible we will speak about alpine at the workshop best practices good so this one i'm going from ubuntu why just because i can then second comment second base comment i mentioned it some minutes ago run run is the command to be executed during the build of the image so in the first step i'm going to reuse ubuntu and the second step i'm doing update update and i install engineex web server mostly probably you know and in the next comment this one is important one this one is to be covered better at the second week but very briefly when yeah we got the question what is ngc used for which this is a web server that's uh yeah stop cedric we have people of very different uh experience so it's no it's just because you said oh uh you probably already know boom you got the question okay so that's super fun my bad my bad question by the way nginx is a web server so is a software which answers uh web requests uh mostly probably when you are open um website in the internet there is some software behind that and i believe nginx stands behind at least half of the websites in the internet so it's one of the most popular web servers overall then second thing this one may look like a little bit tricky right now so let me simplify that a bit those two comments are needed to put locks instead of the normal log files into devested out and def as to the error that's a little bit that's a lot actually not a little bit about linux things i don't want to make a two deep dive into that but in very short explanation i run those two comments to have nginx locks as a normal docker locks output because docker treats um everything what goes to dev as the doubt and dev as to there as its own logs and the most important and the most proper way to handle locks of your application or nginx in this case is to put the logs into estee doubt for access lock and put error lock into the sd error lock if you are familiar with linux you understand what i'm saying right now and ln is just create a soft link to put the things to a proper channel then finally i don't need that right now uh and final comment i need that's the comment which will be executed on the container startup so first nginx minus g daemon off what's going on here so nginx is a common to run engineers that should be pretty clear but what happens and these two and the second and third arguments very easy to explain do you remember what i told you in the beginning then core process process speed 0 or the main process of a container quits container quits as well and the case is there are two kind of execution in the linux system foreground or background so the process will be executed directly or process will switch to background and execute it in the background i'm simplifying but that's the main idea basically you see the process running right now or it's somehow hidden in the background and nginx by default starts in the background but for the docker it looks like core process quits and therefore if i do not put these two arguments docker will consider engine x as just exited and it will exit and kill the container as well to avoid that i explained to ingenix it should not go background but it should switch daemon off it should work in foreground so docker will understand my nginx is running okay so i'm saving this file and i'm saying a familiar comment for you docker build docker build what which sign i should put right now dot because i'm building in this correct for current folder exactly and process is happening and process is done you may ask you have downloaded debian before as a part of a build process but this time you didn't download ubuntu how come answer is very simple i have ubuntu on my laptop downloaded already the docker image or default docker image for ubuntu then update update and update install minus y and geniux so why was it half second quarter second why was it so fast very simple because i execute this build in this folder already and docker uses caching very heavily as soon as it sees what nothing has changed it will as say here using cache and that's very important because sometimes build of a docker image may take literally hours in some use cases so you do want dogger to use cache when possible when we do these two simple run commands just to create links between access lock and deficit doubt error lock to devist there and then finally i set up this command for a container to run again command command command statement is not executed on build it's just the setting for the container what container will do alex exactly on the command line so every single argument is put under double quote is this the way the command work you know all the parameters should be double quote um so uh not necessarily but this approach is them how to say consider it to be most clean and conscious and that's the way how in general you have to do it so you've seen before i just wrote cmd echo hello world will it work yes it will work as well but in general that's not the best practice best practice is to break it write it like that so basically i type a statement statement command command and i'm giving some arguments in an array okay good so now i have this successfully built ab38 blah blah blah blah blah which is very good so my build process is done now i can do first docker run a b three eight uh there is a nice docker hint you may not type the full uh docker id because well full docker id is much longer so this then is an alias but you may even not fully type the alias you may type start to type the first characters and as soon as it allows to uniquely identify an image or a container image in this case it will execute these it will find the most proper image and i say docker run and nothing happens but nginx is running but here comes a little problem if i open my browser and i go to localhost i will have nothing this site can be reached why answer is very simple security by default docker will not publish ports of a running container to the host system and i have nginx running but there is no way to reach it by itself in this way so i want to use a first argument to dock run command which you are going to use a lot it's called publish and then i specify 18 18. so that's important to remember on the right side i specify the port of the container right side is always for the container if you speak of ports or volumes we will speak next week and the left side is always for host so left side is my computer is my laptop and right side is the container i'm having to run so and you if you want to specify that you can simply type docker run minus p it just will be shorter but today i will try to i will try to stick to the official um arguments options and i say docker run publish for host port 80 container port 80 publish and i give the id of the image and again nothing happens but okay that happens already yes because my browser remembered what i was trying to reach with host and as you see nginx is running and here we go and i have my locks here directly okay so now we have nginx running but the problem is as soon as i will close this terminal docker container will quit as well because i run it in the foreground and that's not the best way to run things so i want to stop it localhost is not available anymore pretty obviously nginx is stopped and now i want to add one more option for you to remember in simple it's minus d or full name is detached oh it's a touch sorry perfect what happened now i have some long long clone clone number and nothing more hey where is my engine x is it there yes it's where but where are my locks very simple do you remember the comment i use it to watch for the containers running it was docker ps and it's my screen is a little bit too big i will make it a little bit smaller almost done yes and i will scroll it up so you will see it as well and that's and let's see docker ps we have a container id this part is very similar to this part as you could see very simply when you run a container in detached mode when you run a container in background it docker will print id of this container for you to use if you need this id and here in the docker ps it prints the alias the short form of a unique identificator for the container when it specifies the image base image we use it to run the container specifies the command we use the user to run so nginx minus g daemon off you remember that as a cmd statement in docker file when it was created what's its status any forwarded ports and what's its names docker has a pretty convenient um idea or concept when you work in with multiple developers and you have to discuss different running containers it would be not convenient to say hey cedric how it goes with 6 yeah 2 f 6 5 e7 blah blah blah blah blah no but it's not convenient can you spell it again yeah exactly so to improve that they give some random names uh to containers and if i will run a container based on this image again uh so i will have another container with another name but think a little bit what will happen if i will run this comment again that's the uh tricky question for those who understand ports if i will run this comment again i will have a roar a roar from demon driver fail it because port is already allocated the trick is i'm trying to allocate host port 80 container port 80 and container port 8 is free because it's a new container but host port 80 is already busy of course so now i'm going to run this container again run this image again build a create a container but i will link it to another port and again i have a long id now if i do docker ps i will have a list of two containers running and those are two different containers based on exactly the same class or image class in the terms of object-oriented programming and they have different id they have different runtime but a general idea is exactly the same there is an nginx running and i can now open ingenix on my port 80 and i can open nginx on port 81 and they both are available but those are two different perks and two different containers running and as we are speaking about the containers and what we can do with them second important thing you will use all the time is you will want to see the locks to watch the logs there is a highly secret hidden comment called docker locks and in the end you specify the id of container it makes no sense to specify the id of an image because image image is not a running entity but the template so you have to specify the id of container and i can simply type 96f it will be enough hopefully okay and i see the logs here and i see what this container which is up for some seconds has only one only two requests but if i ask for logs of container jcb06 i will have much more logs because i've executed multiple things and now mostly probably in the debug purposes or development purposes you are going to use logs a lot so there are two more secrets you are going to need to be successful with darker locks command first one option is called follow or briefly speaking f minus f minus f says follow so i will not detach from locks in the end of the locks and if i will renew this page multiple times i oh okay i will have no more logs because it's the second container and i'm watching logs of the first container so i'm going to open at port 80 open multiple times and boom i have more logs coming in very well very good and next point uh it's next thing we want to do the container mostly probably at some point we want to stop it don't forget those containers are still taking your memory so we want to disable them by the way if you take a look at the settings of docker desktop docker for mac at my place and you see my preferences can i have my preferences please yes and you watch the resources you have some very solid numbers allocated of course nginx doesn't require so much but usually no one runs a single container just a single container actually by one a very nice research in year 2017 most of the people report using docker reported what the mid middle medium amount of containers running per project is around eight containers per host system so therefore to run some complex systems uh you definitely may need some more resources so if you are going to launch multiple containers heavy containers at once don't forget to allocate more resources otherwise you may run into some serious problems with your containers running okay so by the way there is some uh graphical user interface at the desktop for docker but that's not true i prefer to stick to old-school command line you can learn user interface on your own in the very end okay so again i want to stop my containers and there are two main ways to stop the container first one is the gentle one docker stop and you give the name of if you and you give the id of a container in this case it's a graceful stop so first docker sends a sick term uh signal to terminate linux definition to a container like okay your time is over you are going to quit and container has to process these signals in our case nginx receives this signal nginx knows what to do with that engine exquisite but there is a second much more brutal way to stop the container call it docker kill in this case docker will not send a sick term but immediately secure the running container that's a much faster way and in this case we had like half a second of difference but when you speak about big systems running on your own laptop uh in some case you want to save some time and if you speak about the production system mostly probably you are going to use docker stop because well this a container may need may have some time to store data to process data or finish processing requests okay and the last change i want to do we have this docker file here and i want to put a little change into that and i want to discover the last main statement you are going to use in your docker files copy copy is the command to copy a file from your laptop to the image on the build time notice i highlight the build time what does that mean answer is very simple you build once run everywhere at the build time you copy this file to the image it will be stored within the image and then you can send this image to your friend to your colleagues store it to a registry and we speak about any way distribute that ship with build ship run and that's very important point do not copy any kind of a credentials any kind of security things passwords tokens into the image don't put essential information or secret information like that because after all you do not know what will happen with your image you will send it to a private image when you will give access to your colleague your colleague will pull this image your collect will push this image to another registry which is not secured anymore as soon as you give away image with everything what's within the image you may say goodbye to that there is a very low uh amount of ways to try to secure it anyhow so watch what you are putting into there for into the image really seriously in my case i'm going to copy file index html located in this particular folder i'm building the image and i'm putting it into var www html index nginx debian html so i told you please don't forget left side for the host right side for the container in this case i'm copying from left to right i'm copy from host file index.html from current folder and i will put it to var www html index engine xdevian html file i uncommented this line i store the file and what i have to do now think for a second i changed the docker file i want to have a new container i have to build a new image because image is an immutable you can you can create an image you run a container out of manage you can delete the image but you cannot just change the image and store it under the same id well there are ways but don't do that please yeah seriously that's one of the worst anti-patterns you may have so i'm going to do docker build dot so docker built in the current directory and boom it's executed very quickly why because for every of the statements instructions before the one i've changed before the one i've added it uses cash using cash using cash using cash over time because only step 5 was added and therefore all the cash on the step 5 and later was discarded but before step 5 all the cash was used and we copy this file and we have this one and we have successfully built a new image and we can find it with the command docker images and to make the list shorter i will make grep and say bd7b boom that's my image it has no name but it's very fine because it has an id and now i can say docker run publish board i will need to powerless port 80 and detach but well actually i don't have to detach because i will be fine running it foreground and i'm specify and i'm specifying bd7b execute so no output so far so good let's open my localhost boom and we have hello world now you maybe can guess what's located in the file i've just added so file index html i'm going to show you this file but by now you have to understand what's that hello world very simple by this copy command executed here i've replaced default index nginx debian file with my own index.html file and i can put whatever i want into this file rebuild an image and i will have this image built here and available good so not so much time left let's move on good so things we covered we cover a docker file from copy run cmd we cover a docker build with no name we will cover dokur built with tech and the second demo we watched our docker images and you've seen what i have plenty a lot of them we did docker run we did default docker run in foreground with the docker run the publishing ports nvd docker run in detached mode so docker container will be running even when i quit the terminal we need docker ps to run uh to watch the list of the containers running we need docker stop and docker kill to gracefully stop or forcefully terminate running container and we also uh we well we didn't do docker aram and docker image ram but we will do it as a part of the next demo when we just have seen how to build a simple docker image and we just seen how to run a simple container based on this image but docker says build ship run what about ship how you are going to use other images and how others are going to use your images let's take a look to transfer images we need to know how to push and pull images and to transfer images we literally use commands docker push if you want to push your image and docker pull if you want to pull the image but where to push and from where to pull answer is registry or repository there are multiple available docker repositories in the world the most famous one like the most widely used is the hub docker.com uh we will see it in a moment and you are going to use it today or later this week depends on your free time and hubdoker.com is the main one in general docker registry or docker repository is the thing what stores images for you and when i say docker file from something or when i say docker run something what happens we need a base image from where something and by default it will use hub.docker.com let me even switch for a second so i'm go for hubdoker.com and that's the main official repository for images if you want to pull publicly available images then you don't need to have an account but i highly recommend you to create your own account actually that's the part of the assignment for today for you to be able to push your own images to a docker hub as long as your images are publicly available kinda open source it's completely free you have to pay for docker hub only if you have multiple repositories multiple images are private so only log it in person who you gave access may download your images for open uh public images it's completely free and you may have thousands of different uh absolutely official images here we are using you have postgre you have oracle you have i don't know of course you have cassandra and of course you have data stacks uh images yeah can you try to zoom in oh yes thank you sorry i forgot to usually i never forgot uh but here yes yeah thank you yeah so we have some cassandra things we have data stacks enterprise of course and many many many many hours for example you remember we just run in nginx and to run nginx we use it in ubuntu and we did update update update install nginx we get we gave a comment but you know what good developer is a lazy developer why should we run why should we install nginx if ingenix team did it already for us you have official build of nginx available right here with more than one billion downloads and very many different options for all the cases you may want to have and that's perfectly works good uh but that's the part of the second demo and you will use hub i hopefully today and well that's live demo second part so we are going to do some things very quickly in the terminal again so i just said we did this upgrade ubuntu update update install engine x stay lazy stay efficient why should i install nginx if i can say docker run nginx unable to find image engineering latest locally because i don't have it locally what happens then docker goes to hub.docker.com and pulls default nginx image true and it image consists of multiple layers we will cover this topic more in the future um and i should have used alpine but that doesn't matter it's stuck for first layer don't know why yeah it's downloading um so question about docker swarm i would say it's not huge at all anymore right oh yeah uh i see de baron pal asks shall we learn docker swarm is it used these days so with all my respect to docker team um swarm is not in high demand and not in high use anymore it had chances but it was in the direct competition when they give kubernetes and kubernetes has won so now everyone who has to orchestrate containers on multiple machines multiple containers are using kubernetes and swarm for example swarm is installed by default in docker for mac and i'm using docker for more than five years i um use it swarm two times in my life to estimate that and in the end we in my former project we stick to kubernetes as well it doesn't mean swarm is not in use but yes there are some better let's say alternatives from my point of view good so we see what nginx was downloaded and started with a simple comment docker run engineers and well i don't have my port open sorry so i have to publish 8018 good i can go to port come on ah of course i can go to my localhost and okay okay welcome to nginx wait was cache that looks better so nginx is running and receiving my requests but now one very important thing you maybe have noticed it uh what i didn't do docker pull command i did docker run command what's what case how it happened very easy i can you i can uh when i say docker run docker will execute pool for me automatically so i don't have to explicitly say pull but if i want to just download image without building anything just to have it on my list i may say dokalpu docker pool hello world and hello world image will be downloaded it's a default tiny docker image and it will be downloaded without running it creating containers or anything boom we have downloaded this image and there is the next thing called docker push i use it when i'm going to push my own images and from now on we cannot use just ids so as you remember we were using these ids long long long ids blah blah blah bd 7b and so on that's fine when you're working locally but when you work globally with hobdocker.com you may use you may want to have more conscious names so first thing i have to do when i'm creating a new image i want to create my own repository for that so i have my repositories here i will create a new one as my account i will create a repository and i will call it hello world okay it will be public so you can use it and uh i will create that boom now i have repository how this architect hello world now what i'm going to do now i need to link my image existing image or new image with this repository first way to do it when i build an image i may say minus t or minus minus stack i will use the short one minus t and i have to give it the name so first one will be a name of my profile hudders architect and second will be hello world that's the repository i'm using to store this image and last point i have to set the point i'm going to build it locally it's going to be quick because it was built recently so i'm using cache but now you remember like build used before successfully built bd7b blah blah blah blah blah now it has the name successfully target honest architect so owner hello world repository and the final thing is tag i will explain in a moment and now i can say docker push and i give this name of the image i have it will be hardest architect slash hello world so owner repo tag and i'm pushing that and it pushes the image my channel is pretty busy with the stream so it may take a second but in general that's the thing you can you you have to do when you are pushing the image and in a moment that's a very nice optimization i really like take a look you remember we built from ubuntu image consists of layers and those four layers were built and pushed but those three layers were not uploaded at all because layers of exactly these content were already stored at thehub.docker.com and therefore there is no need to upload them because they exist already and it mounts um those images from library ubuntu and that's really cool in this case it was pretty quick but when you work with huge images which still happens we will teach you not to do that with our best practices plus those three layers were simply mounted and never uploaded never transferred via internet which is great and my image is downloaded here okay and i can renew my page and i should have my repositories yes how does architect hello world great and we have with this repository contains one tag which is latest okay so what's the tag let me explain you let's go for python i see a lot of you are using python and that's very easy to explain what's for python uh what's the attacks are based on the python the trick is uh everyone who works with python knows very well there is no a single simple thing like python but you have python 2 python 3 3 8 3 2 not of them are compatible to each other some libraries are using some specifical versions of python and so on and so forth so tags we are using to build different images for the same repository for example if we see list of texts for python we have latest which is latest available python but we all also have windows server core python for windows we also have slim which is again default latest python but the image is going to be smaller because for example default python latest see the size of the linux version is 330 megabytes but the slim version which is designed to be smaller is only 40 megabytes it means what some dependencies aren't installed and some external libraries maybe not available also they're usually available an alpine version alpine is a very tiny linux so a free 12 python on alpine is going to be 16 megabytes which is much smaller therefore and easier to work oh sorry it's not free uh 12 python but 312 alpine version and so on and so forth you have free eight python uh you definitely will have somewhere down python version two so as you see there are really a lot of different uh versions different text for the same repository how do i use that very simple way i just built my hello world but i want to change something i go to my index.html file i'm saying hello everyone from alex control x yes i'm going to build this image and i will set a tag on that i will say alex and otherwise it looks exactly the same build process happens very quickly till level five we are still using cash because this is a cash at things at the step five cash is um invalidated because some files are changed and therefore at this step we stop to use cache and start to build from scratch so no cache anymore as file has changed and i have new one and you see successfully target hardest architect hello world alex and now i can say docker pushed um instead of latest alex and now it should happen much quicker because of the same layer already exist think so basically only one layer was changed and i'm pushing only one layer and all others were reused because although i'd get installed ninja next i execute it already and store it at hub.docker.com that's damn amazing okay and we have a new tag so i can switch to my own repositories i can open my hello world and in the list of texts i will have my two texts latest and alex and now there is a thing you may ask me but alex when you did a build for not the alex version but for the latest version you didn't specify latest here but you push it for latest one what's the trick what are you hiding my answer is i'm hiding nothing at least not from you by default this one is absolutely equivalent to this one so if you set no tag it will be taken as latest and if you say latest it will use the last this one default without so latest is the same as complete without any tech latest is the tech by default one last trick in my case i am logged in to docker hub in my console that's why i can push but for you one more comment you will need is docker login and you will have to give your password and username in my case i don't have to do that because i'm logged in on this terminal already anything else to show i've shown all of these and final things uh speaking about the cleanup i have to delete some things i don't need anymore so to delete an image i give docker image a ram i am going to delete hello world and notice i said no tag what does that mean it will use that latest default tag boom untick it and take it deleted deleted and if i want to delete the containers take a look i have no containers but that's not the full trough because i can say docker ps minus a and i have a lot of them oh my god i have to do a serious cleanup so as you see i have a bunch of containers existing from five months ago but not executed anytime and to remove a container i'm going to go for daughter ram and give id of the container boom and i have one container less i promise to you i will do a big cleanup today that looks like not how it should be so uh demo two is over and we are very close to a final slide how about real application because now we do we did very very very simple things and how it works for the real applications okay that's a very simple example i have for you that should be in my flask okay we are a little bit out of time but we are mostly done so just a couple of slides left that's a very simple folder which imitates a very simple application using python and flask framework let's take a look on what we have here i see a lot of people have experience with python if you don't i will explain you file requirements take stay is the file by default you use to define dependencies of your project in my case file requirement stake stack consists of only one line flask version one one two what does that mean my application is going to use flask framework then apply is the application by itself let me show it to you that's a very tiny flask application we import flask framework we create a flask application and we define a route or method to call which will be executed when we open the main page of application which will just return hello world i will even change it a little bit to be hello hello world hello from docker we did hello world already today hello from docker very well and final file so we have only three files is docker file as the docker file we need to build the image docker file looks like that okay i will bet for you [Music] good so from python free alpine and now you know what's going on here from is the base image we are going to use and we will not use ubuntu or alpine but we will go directly to the python official python image built by python team which is prepared may be much better when i could do that because well they are professionals working explicitly with python and now we know double point it separates stack from the image name so we go python and the deck will be free alpine so this one specifies it will be python version 3 3.3.8 so free latest but it also will be based on alpine linux to make it smaller second in a second instruction we didn't cover it before work dear you can guess workdir sets the working directory in the image for all the next actions copy copy is to copy very simple first dot don't remember don't forget left side for host right side for image or for container for docker i'm going to copy the current folder so the folder we are in docker file up pi and requirements.txt to current directory in the image and what's the current directory in the image see one line above user src up next instruction is familiar to you run what we are going to do we are going to run pip python manager for dependencies we asking that to install we asking that to install from file requirements takes time and this is not really required here i will explain it in the next workshop or better in the best practices so we can clear it up right now we don't need that and that's the next and last for today in instruction for the docker file and means environment variable in this case we specify to environment variable what would be a default file for flask to run flask up will be file up dot phi and flask environment will be set to development that means what flask will run in development mode with debug enabled and finally cmd should be familiar for you as well we are giving command to run flask with some options we call flask to execute run giving options host will be 000 open and port will be 80 and that's all what we need now i'm going to build that so who remembers how to build an image docker build dot i build that now uh real build happens now it's very close to a real dockerized application it's very simple but that's for real first we are using python3alpine it's downloaded already we set the here we copy all files we run pip install requirements txt here comes the pip install by itself if you work via python you may recognize those lines we are collecting flask vertoig ginger and so on and installing those dependencies here then we set up environment variables we are going to need flask up and flask n development we run and we set the command for the container what's going on to happen right now is very simple i have to run this command docker run fd beam one i will need to specify the ports to publish it will be again 80 80 left for the host right for the container and i'm running this one whoo it works we see what flask application is running we see what environment as a development and as we specified here it runs on zero zero zero port 80 so it's available for us and debugger is active because of environment development and we can go to our port atm localhost and open it and see hello from docker that's the real python application very small very simple but it's a python application using a framework flask yeah indeed and final thing for us for today we want to do as we are speaking here and you see logs uh my request has come and final thing we want to do for today is very simple you have noticed it what i'm specifying environment variable flask and development and those of you who relate to ops or devops may be unhappy what does that mean this image will always be running in the development application how the hell i'm going to run it in the production with a debugger enable it with uh i don't know stack trace put into the uh browser so every client will see our stack trace or maybe even credentials go on let's play let's put the passwords here no one of the easiest and best ways to set up application setup dockerized application to run to behave differently depending on the environment you run development staging production or to set up different passwords because your password and your collec password may be different other environment variables when i set the default values in the docker file i specify just f flask up flask f whatever environment variable you may need but i also can change that take a look here i was running this container specifying only the port to forward or to publish but i want to do one more thing i'm doing minus e which states for minus minus environment minus minus n and i am setting that flask f equals reduction who knows what will happen next after i run that if i did no mistake i did no mistake flask says environment production it warns me flask is a development server don't use it in production because i told them we are kind of running on production we use a production via js server instead well doesn't matter debug mode off we are running in production this way i define a default image i'm storing and i'm working with but you when you run the same image change its runtime behavior by just giving new value here minus e flask and production and it still will work the same for the end user but we know what there is no stack trades public publish to browser and there is no debug mode enabled and that's incredible so a little bit of homework we have only five things to do but i will start with the bottom one if you have uh any friends of kali if you watch this video live or well if you watch this video not live but anyway it means you like that because it's the very end and we are pretty a lot over time so i'm happy to have you here and thank you for being with us invite a friend or a colleague that's the first week and it's a perfect time to jump in as you see there is no marketing or anything like that there is engineers to engineers about engineering things so invite your friends and colleagues we will be very happy to see more people to join the participation we have to register at the evander bride page where you have mostly probably registered and now regarding the real things first you will have to create an account and hub docker.com second which may be a little bit harder you have to install docker or make yourself familiar with flaps.playvivdoker.com simply speaking where is my browser oh my god okay yes uh labs play with docker.com given you have the id or docker id is a web-based docker terminal you can work with docker directly it's not the most convenient way to use the docker but it's the easiest way to use the docker if you cannot install that i'm logged in using my hub.docker.com id i'm adding a new instance it's completely free and now i have my application running right here so i can say docker run nginx of course i have to pass through the ports publish 8080 boom it pulls nginx it runs nginx here you have button uh you will have button in a minute open port 80 yeah it's just a period and you can click that and you you have your application running and available so docker playground is a good thing uh you may have some instances you may play with swarm if you want well we don't explain swarm this time it's the easiest way but not the most convenient i recommend you to install docker locally then the main step continue writes a simple hello world application in the language or frequent framework of your choice please choose a simple scenario like the python flask application we did today with hello world choose something simple simple don't take a complex multi-container setup with caching service databases and so on pick something simple we will advance next week and you will do much more complex job next week and sure you use it every comment from today's class for the docker file and command and command line and push your image to the docker hub to your new very own repository we will need them next week thank you so much and see you next week yeah it was great what a good end zone yeah now uh cedric i have a question actually for you uh our attendees may need a way to communicate with us during this course and i'm thinking what the best way would be maybe to use a dedicated channel at our discord server would you totally agree okay very well so let me show you then our discord server you will use to ask for questions um easiest way to go to our discord server is to type beat dot le cassandra workshop i will send this link soon to you so actually that opens discord i have discord as an application but you may use discord in the browser as well i don't want to open an app i want to open discord in the browser and we have our own server here running and we are to create a special channel for docker related things and i will wait for you there and answer your questions cedric thank you so much that oh you did all the work today i'm just listening and learning well that's uh my uh own course design it out of years with docker so now i can't wait for your docker data stocks monday learning uh coming next month it will be great i'm absolutely sure and um thank you so much see you soon see you next week see you next week",
