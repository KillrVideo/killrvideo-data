    "text": "hello everybody and welcome i am david jones gilardi joined today by cedric linvin cedric hello everybody happy to be there for another week and another workshop let's do it so cedric what are we what are we talking about today what are we doing i don't even know what we're doing oh yeah i mean it's pretty obvious looking at the title we will do you will implement a micro services using spring boot spring data on top of cassandra and the best part of it you don't have to install anything as usual but we will explain everything to you in a minute so let's get rolling let's do it let's do it okay i was keeping um this is two moving ads uh both on youtube and twitch uh so we are there to answer your question mostly on the youtube chat uh twitch is just there as a backup the twitch link the twitch links is in the description just as a backup the issue with youtube is when the live ended you just cannot reach out to us anymore the the chat just stop and so we put in place a discord room so the fellowship of the rings here you do have the link beat dot lee slash cassandra dash workshop we will answer your question there 24 7 almost and guess what in this room we do have now uh 9.2 people you know that just you know almost 10k people already are just amazing um when it comes to doing um exercises you will see that that we will use software as a service tools and id in the cloud named gitpod and as usual we love this workshop to have as many interaction as possible that's right and so we will ask you quiz in the beginning and in the end in the beginning it just assess your level what you expect um are you mostly beginner expert and in the end if you listen carefully what we say during the stream we will have five question quiz and if you are fast you can win some swag as we stated this workshop will be a lot of hands-on so if you are beginners you can simply relax i won't ask you to write some complex code even if it's java java is simple no you won't have any complex code to write so if you are a beginner watch me going through the exercise redo the exercise at your face and get the most of the session by asking questions uh to me in the chat david or the crew that's monitoring the other question if you are intermediate level you can you know go to the github repo scroll the slide quickly and start doing the exercise on your own they should be more or less self-paced um and if you are expert okay so i will try to answer your question in the end what you will learn today uh it's what it's new in spring data 3.0 and uh how to connect uh spring data to astra which is cassandra as a service also if you saw people joining in you know in the middle of the of the live it's not a big deal because the exercise are organized in branches on github and so you can simply go get check out part three and you're good to go to for exercise three even if you did not manage to do exercise one and two uh all the solutions are there and you can move right away to the end of everything running if you want to the last branches it's called the end and you do have everything implemented um so with that i think we can go so today we will use we will create a very simple uh microservice it is the to do application okay if you are in the javascript field maybe you know you tends to learn a new framework to do mvc uh using the website to do mvc.com uh where you find let's say dozens and dozens of implementation of the same ui which is a to-do list so we will use that ui implement a back-end to interact with that using rest spring data and cassandra and we don't want you to install anything so cassandra will be a custom browser service in the cloud and provided by the astra service astradadas.com it's free to use no credit card nothing and we will see in the middle it's very very easy to instantiate and work with when it comes to do some java code um you can work locally but you would have you would need maven java and be always already intermediate level okay for uh this two-hour session we would rather you using the git pod which is the id in the cloud but if you feel confident to run that locally there is nothing preventing you to do that we simply won't provide you any support to run that exercise locally you know it's always some issues if you are reading windows and linux and mac and all the small details we just get lost answering those installation steps we simply say okay use git pod you will have everything ready and running and later if you want to do the exercise on your laptop you can so today uh we will first create a to-do app okay run the existing what it look likes create an empty app uh create the rest api do some mocking from the rest api so not the real implementation of the rest api and then we will connect this api to cassandra and our goal for today is to be able to create a new task and see that the tasks are updated and edited live in kasona okay so without further due um the link of the github repo for today is in the youtube description this is the first link this is also available on screen i just trust where yes and this is where i'm eating because i will do the exercise with you so if i'm going to the github repo okay workshop spring data casama by the way look at the name of the organization data stacks academy if you browse there you see all the content for all our uh previews uh workshop come on okay okay unique oh unicorn we got a unicorn what's a pity you know we're just over yeah did you always okay um so that is tax academy see we do have dozens and dozens of workshops so on you know machine learning reactive kubernetes cassandra in there for those of you who are new to cassandra as well yeah there are a lot um anyway next week we will do jump stack for the javascript folks and it will be also also here so what i would like you to do first is go there and launch kid pod so simply right click the button open that in a new tab and so it will open an ide in the cloud for you okay let's see and if you've not used gitpod before it is totally normal for it to take a minute or two right um it's got you know pulled docker images and some resources it's doing that all up in the cloud though um but yeah expect it to take a minute or two yeah the cloud ide is really uh the current age that you will pull open and we also run some pre-build as you can see on my screen and pre-build easily some maven command to initialize the project so see i have done nothing and i do have a terminal there ready to go um okay let me put that bigger yeah we definitely need a bigger okay okay what about now is he big enough maybe a little bit more and then for those of you who are watching give us a thumbs up you know as we zoom in because obviously as he's doing things in a terminal we want you to be able to see and read what he's being what he's doing let us know if it's if it's working for you if you need zoomed in a little bit more okay so simply put during the time it's starting so uh git pod is an ide that already provide uh so maven is there java is there npm is there python is there go is there so there are a ton of tools ready to go for you as you can see it's based on vs code and of course you can run vs code extension as well so for this enzyme we will use the spring boot extension the long block extension and spring boot tools okay it's the auto save is selected by default so when you edit some piece of code it will be automatically a save so that's pretty neat as well and we did get a whole set of thumbs up uh so it looks like the the size is good at least the font size and everything so i think we're good there cool so i will when it comes to do the end zone i will try to say as much as possible on this screen just to avoid you to open 20 tabs on your brother you probably already have one for us on the youtube and so if we can limit the number of window you open it's better okay so if you look at the readme so as you can see the readme has been opened with a preview on the top of the page and so here you can see expected output so far so good and so uh just simply tell you that gitbot provides you everything and so there are some a command line named gp for git pod and the first command line i can ask you to type is gp url 1990 so not all ports are open on the platform and so if you want to access the 8080 port you need to use this url so when we will start an application listening on port 8080 to access this ap uh this application you will use this public url okay gpurl80 that give you the public url to access the 880 part okay and now they asked me let's move to part one and so i will do a little bit of intro but this is how you move from one step to another so it was like the getting started and if i do keep check out part one i will check out the branch part one and you see the readme has been refreshed with the content of part one and i can start doing exercise one if i want to okay so let's see uh i will wait for your thumb up to see if you were able to open git board do the small gpurl 8080 and git checkout part one this is always so suspenseful right here we're waiting for the thumbs up yeah you know and you know the git bot guys just are calling that the stack right now saying hey guys what are you doing yeah we have definitely gotten a phone call here there between uh between catacona and getpod and others all right i am starting to see some thumbs up come in and give everyone another comment here yeah okay so for intermediate level again you can start doing the exercise one by one those are self-service i will simply go back to basics and explain what we will do okay i think we also got some uh oh god what is that i'm gonna age myself right now what is that called what is it dapping the the thing yeah is that is that what it is we have a couple dapping ghosts yeah yeah on top of the thing i've never seen that one that's kind of a fun one thank you for that travel and living thank you yes so yeah git body hitbot is just great yeah you know i really love it and uh if you really want to dig more into kit board and you already have some experience go to uh you know dot git pod folder in the repo and you will see all the settings i do have i do have some gitpod.dml.gitpod.docker file and it will show you everything that i did to have the workspace open exactly as i expect when you simply click the button okay so i already uh introduced you a little bit about to mvc and to-do back-end to mvc the reference website to show you how to implement this reference application in multiple javascript languages now to do backend it just the same things but for the backends okay so we want to create a rest api to make the to-do web ui working okay and so on to do backend.com you also have multiple implementation of the same api and what it's need with todobakken.com is it provides you some specification tester and client tester so we can implement something with a tdd approach test driven development this guy will give us the test to pass and from that we will create the app so i told you about a spec runner and client runner you will see in exercise part one i will give you the link to go there um but you will see that it's just um to do back-end api route target test route and we will uh we will be able to um you know test this api if everything is okay you will have all the tasks in your cassandra instance you know in an hour about an hour okay so um test running application so let's do part one and only then i will go to spring so this is you know part one and for part one i really want you simply to go and do a part one step one or an existing application hey cedric while you're here in gippod um i saw one question come in from one of our friends on discord that was uh geminin 79 is having a hard time opening up the port could you show real quick how to open a port and get the url there in gitpod oh um so by default all ports are closed i can set up in gitpod.yaml that i do want a port open in the beginning so 8080 so it's not it's not something you have to do i did it when i open the workspace what i ask you to do in the comment line is just some url so gp for git pod url 8080 and this is a way to show you what is a public url for port 8080 portal att is still closed but there are some routing mechanisms inside git pod that will move from this public url which is port 8080 port 80 as you can see there are no port here and it will map that to your app but you know as of today as of now there is nothing running right we haven't done it yet if i click there to open it just okay part not found it's not didn't response of course there is nothing ready hopefully we will start something and it will change okay so step part one step one run the existing to-do app so i told you about to do mvc let's move uh i can open to do mvc in a new tab just for you i told you let's speak oh i will i do david sorry let's pick i don't know vue.js whatever you like go there and task one plus two task three so this is the ui you want to have and this is to do mvc okay i can close enough of to do mvc second is to do back-end okay to do back-end run api okay so you can go to to-do back-end um what is interesting if people that already implemented this api in other languages provide you a public url to invoke this app so for instance if i try to open these on a dedicated link see i do have a web page there the application is running but as of today there is no way to access that so i can also show the quarkus one and so see here it seems to already have some uh tasks there so what i will do and sorry except now maybe point out about to do mvc and to do back end right because we do have a question over on youtube from jasper said well what are we using for the front end um so the cool thing with both to do mvc and to do back end is that you get to choose right they are example frameworks reference frameworks that are built like to do mvc right you can pick what uh vue angular react whatever right you can pick all sorts of different platforms that you want to implement the front end in and then you just go with that one so it's really nice if you're learning new languages and such and the to do back end one i don't know if you've got the screen up cedric but the amount of languages that is available for it is amazing yes yes so so the answer is whatever you want to pick i believe though cedric in the the workshop you have one already uh chosen uh yes so i mean um for the workshop in to do back end so if okay let's let's go to to do back end let's see i will show you in to-do back-end okay not only you do have all the implementation available uh order by by topic and such but as i told you there are some uh spec runner so if i open the spec runner this guy will test your endpoint and see if it's okay or not the endpoint is open and public okay we are in demo mode test mode so we won't authenticate we won't secure the endpoint it's not part of the specification of to-do back-end but not only a spec runner but also a client and so if you go to let's see it was the spec runner but if you change spec by client this is your client okay so the client is provided by to-do back-end again you don't have to know which one you will use and if you pick some existing backend that do have the api running okay i will go there and now see i can uh test and now i'm using an existing public api somewhere on someone somewhere on internet to work what i would like now is connect this ui to your environment so let's see let's see how we do okay uh so step one be test to do back end test the spec runner against one of these existing api so i will pick number two okay so i will simply open this guy so it's and this is exactly what i did i can either go to here so to do back-end spec and provide the url it will start testing so you can have some issue here and you know what it's because we are all testing the same nodes at the same time so you can have some issue so you can either open these two up as i did like that or you can uh i do have issue because this is some uh blocking on the brave brother nevermind so or you can use another command from gitbod which is gp preview to open a web page and if i do gp preview it will open the page on the left side and i can start doing stuff but seems like i do have an email cannot read property of define get yeah so that's funny like uh we all working with the same end point and if i try to you know to execute the code i can some error because probably others people are trying to do the same but anyway uh here you do have the id this is the unit test we need to start working okay let's move on expected output if you were alone working on that this is what you get but here you can have issue because we all invoking the same endpoint okay which is true for the test runner is also true for the client and so um if i i i i went there already so if you go there open the client instead of the spec now you do have la la la you do have a task that's one okay move on okay link to web one two three one two three blah blah blah are the tasks created by the test runner so later today when you will have your own app running blah blah blah would be the value you will have in your database okay moving on and i will stop there and go back to slide a little bit uh just to give you an overview what is spring okay as of now is really showing you what we will do we did not code anything yet we will implement this to-do app so spring spring is really if you want to start a java career this is the framework you know to go it's wiring most of uh application as of today to be honest is it's by far the most famous java framework out there and so it's all starting with the pattern inversion of control the id the core id of spring is really you provide multiple implementations of the same interface okay so here i do have an interface greetings creating service and i do have an implementation greeting service implementation but i can also have a second implementation of the same interface okay and at runtime when i need to work with greeting service i don't care about the implementation this is the job of spring to bring me the proper implementation and this is what we call inversion of control now we are only working with the interface and you know you can change the implementation if you want to it introduced some decoupling some loose coupling in between java component it was really the key that start spring as a matter of fact the first name of spring was was interface interface 21 releasing 204 so i was there i think i started using spring with spring.jar which was a version one very very early but spring um due to its huge success with more and more libraries more and more component to help you building apps so it's building some micro service environments reactive environment cloud everything you need to expose a web app can be the api so rest api and can also be controllers like model view controller you want to do a full web app with also views spring mvc can help and even even more and if i simply click on one of those let's say micro services under the wood you will have dozens and dozens of smaller libraries to do monitoring of the micro service to do security of the micro service to do data access for your micro service and it's all spring something spring starter activator spring boot spring data spring context sprinkle so really spring is really the toolbox that most people use when they start building java application spring is not the only one okay we do have newcomers that are getting some tractions like micro note or quarkus spring is still leading okay and in the java world the specifications are the g2e okay java 2 enterprise and stuff like micro service like micro note implements those g2e specifications spring is another beast is really using his own interfaces his own stuff all right so enough talking let's move let's see what we can do when it comes to micro services a micro services is really a component that do have his own runtime so you don't need any application server anymore so tomcat uh websphere weblogic all these big application servers running multiple applications at the same time we don't do that anymore we are creating a component that is a standalone it's not deployed as a war anymore but as a standalone jar and everything is included and the added value is there is no more coupling in between application because they are not running in the same application server and it's easy to skate to scale i mean you want multiple instance of your micro service simply start multiple time the app you're good to go okay so spring boot is the run time to create some micro service with spring in this runtime multiple layers so persistent layer to access the databases presentation layer which is api controller you know all the way to interact with your users or consumers and in between this is what we call the business layer where you use all the business logic aggregation composition and at some point spring is such an advanced framework that everything related to database will be handled by string everything related to the rest api will be on that but string and you are now your only job is to implement the business logic and the business code and this is one of the reason spring is so popular the fact that it provides you a lot of way for you to to to make your job easier okay so um in the spring boot world there are really two stacks so the traditional stacks uh spring mvc using a servlet so with spring security mvc and spring data and there is also a full reactive stack okay we won't cover the reactive stack today but say you can also have some api reactive using webflux security reactive spring data reactive including a connectivity to cassandra so reactive really means there is nothing blocking anymore but there are also some requirements if you start an application as a reactive any blocking call is now forbidden using spring web flux if you happen to use any blocking call spring make plus won't even start telling you i they take some blocking code in your application and i cannot be fully asynchronous and so i cannot you know have the performance to expect for me today super easy super sample traditional stack we will use spring boot mvc spring data and so if you look at the right part of the screen you see the layers that you will find in boot which is controller which is this is our api services services are the business layer where you want to compose repository already the persistent layer data access connectivity is really the drivers that will enable connectivity to the database and database this is our [Music] canvas our map for today and when i talk about controller i will light the controller box and so forth and so on hey cedric we have a question from arun over in youtube and roone asks in case of standalone spring application no need to deploy does that mean it contains a container within the app so does it increase the size true yes the size of the jar is really about 100 megabytes it's a fat jar a big jar yeah it's include all your third-party dependencies bring by maven but also indeed a runtime and so the runtime is by default i think it's still tomcat embedded but you can also use undertow or even jt to host your you know standalone app but yes it's a fat jar with a main and so the runtime is included indeed cool good question thanks erin very good question okay so we did the part 1.1 let's do part 1.2 so moving on here clear i will let's drop this preview can i just close the preview like that now i want to close my yeah closing the preview okay and let's go here with create your spring boot application um spring provide a super useful website start dot spring dot io and through the web ui you can set up the app you want to build and you will simply download a zip with running the app is raining is ready to run i have all the dependencies ready to go and this is your starting point and even better uh you can create some custom links so this is what i did today and so if you click on the big these links it will open standard spring.io and i've already filled all the value for your app okay so group id artifact id name which are the maven coordinates description package name the ddk you want to use so hopefully now everybody have moved to gk11 i know it's not the case but uh you know gdk8 is not supporting anymore by the way i know i'm holding gdk7 the new lts will be really soon if not already okay so yeah 11 should be the way to go in 2021 at least okay so for dependencies in the spring boot ecosystem it's all came as starter if i want monitoring spring boot starter monitoring if i want security spring bootstrap security the monitoring is called spring boot starter actuator but never mind you got the id you need the features try to look at spring boot starter features so and if i say add dependency here you see all the flavors all the technical capabilities that spring is able to offer out of the box okay so web template and shine remember i told you about mvc so you can use time leaf free marker message groovy security including octa sql no sql and guess what today we will use some no sql stuff because we will use apache kasanga and so if you look what i imported spring data for customer spring boot tools which is the the component that will restart automatically my app when i edit my code just to avoid to each time stop restart stop restart it will be done by the dev tools spring web we want to expose a api a rest api so the rest controllers are part of spring web so you need to import spring boot starter web lombok is a java library not really related to spring but it's a nice tool tooling to avoid you creating all the getters and setters and constructors and all this boiling plain boiling plate code you need when we deals with plain old java object and the actuator is monitoring stuff so you can simply generate and it will download the zip but guess what i did that work for you and when you open the repo this is exactly the content that you do app it's the zip that i've downloaded and i unzip there so this work you don't have to do but if tomorrow you need to build a new spring boot app using cassandra start with the link you will get your from scratch sample ready to go okay so now the sample code is there we have downloaded open so we can start the app i told you the app should be ready to go so i have two lines here so i will move to the proper folder and i will start the app okay i see already it's in red you will get an error don't worry it's expected okay because it's the first time we are running a maven command maven will have to download some third-party dependencies so it will start and say yeah i cannot start and now you told me what the heck you just told me that i can simply download that app and it should be working yes it should uh now um spring is all about convention so he tried to initialize the application as best as the best escam and so in this in the main class so this is to do back-end spring you do have a spring boot application which is the annotation to tell okay this is my main class this is the one you need to start well this guy is pretty clever he will look into the class pass and because in the class pass you will find cassandra or auto configuration and cassandra data auto configuration it will start to connect to cassandra right away with the default values and default values to connect to cassandra is localhost 42 and so the error message you get is simply put i cannot access to cassandra locally because this app is using all the default values so what we need to do first is to say okay okay for now please do not try to connect to cassandra by yourself let's just start with the empty app and so what we what we ask you to do here is go there and simply update that annotation to say okay exclude cassandra data and cassandra auto configuration okay all right and now if i run again the app okay okay by the way while we're waiting for that cedric avanesh in youtube asks i missed how the spring initializer was brought into gitpod if you don't mind can you please tell me how um okay it we did not show how i simply tell you that this step to download the zip and unload the zip in in git pod i did that for you you know even before starting the workshop what i did is i downloaded this zip before the workshop start and i commit this default project in the main branch of my github repo and so when gitpod initialize all the sources in this gitpod repo will be available in the gitpod and so this is why all this source code is already there i i simply did not do that in front of you downloading the zip unzip and commit but um having these sample projects just coming from nowhere would have been a bit surprising so i simply show you how i did to have this default class okay so seems like the app is starting look at that i do i do not have any error anymore and so what i can do i can open a new terminal and i can try to open now the port 8080 okay so remember so you can remember gp url 880 so i could go there and now okay it's written white label error but there is no more uh something telling you that the 8080 did not respond 8080 responds now but you do have the empty page which is a bit annoying because the empty page in spring boot is really this white error label okay and this is exactly what we want to change so i will stop my app and i will move to the next step which is i don't like this white label error page so let's see what we can do yeah so i open a new tab and just to open that url you can also use gp preview and your page will just show up on the panel on the side i will do that right after that okay so well i will simply create a controller an api i will create hello world api so in the workshop i will create a new folder hello okay and i will create a new file and i will call that file what is your name right okay hello world hello world controller okay so let's do that new file a level controller.java okay and i will you know just close close i will simply copy paste the code copy paste all right okay so now if you look at that i do have at the root of my application slash i do have hello world so now if i start my app so let's see uh i start my happy on this tab so let's spring boot and here i want to open the preview so it will be gp preview where are you gp preview okay so my app is running so let's now open the app on the left part okay i do have hello world so now i do have it's still an empty app using spring boot but now i do have a default rest api which is simply hello world okay um i will pause here and give you a couple of minutes to try to to to catch up okay um again i i probably move fast because as i told you if your intermediate level do the exercise at your pace if you are a beginner simply watch me doing another exercise and for those of you who want to take a little bit more time with it and everything the workshop is designed to be totally self-service right um so you can then follow up and do this at your own pace if you so choose afterward yes if we did our job correctly you can do this workshop service and oh by the way the stream that we are doing now is recorded you know you can use the same link tomorrow and you will have the recording of the session so you can pause the video and do the exercise at your pace and so this is it for part one so whether what is what is ask in the end is move to part two to just say okay check out part two so hey send a question for you from jasper and youtube can we use colon instead of java for exposing rest endpoints on top of cassandra oops yeah you know as a matter of fact yes of course yeah of course we can so um there is really no difference in a kotlin based application you can use uh third party libraries also in java yeah okay this is simply the way to expose the api that is just different it's all about func you know all the keywords from the kotlin language but also spring is pretty famous to try to move from java to kotlin some of the spring boot module just to ease anything i told you about lone bug that helps you remove all the boilerplate code cutling is all about that you know when you start implementing in kotlin is that oh wow getter setters are all done for you and you know you the code is much more it's it's much more small you know and something to just add on to what jasper said there that last part for exposing rest endpoints on top of cassandra so something really cool right um is with today when we use astra that the you know the the self-service the managed uh the cloud managed uh cassandra that we're gonna use today the free tier or any of the tiers um you'll see in there and we can maybe bring this up once we get there there are rest you have rest endpoints you have graphql you've got a document api and that's actually powered by stargate.io which is itself another open source project um that i believe this ep is actually out there for open source cassandra right or no actually can you use that today you can use that today is that correct cedric stargate with open source cassandra yeah yes yes so sergey enables rest endpoints graphql and a document api for cassandra so we're going to get that as just part of astra because it's already built into it but you could hook that up to your open source cassandra so you wouldn't really have to implement those on your own if you didn't want to you could just use stargate to do it so i'll grab the the stargate.io link and drop it for you um so you can take a look at that yeah sure and this is also part of the slides in the end just to show what we can do okay so i see some uh just comment like say in the redmi they mention step two yeah maybe i'm surprised i i already see that we check out part one and part two maybe this is just these steps that are misleading or the number that are not correct but you know i will check that i will review uh things after the workshop okay so let's move on it was uh create a spring boot app and have the controller ready just a rest api to say hello world okay now we need to move from this hello world to the real apis which are create to do delete to do post patch update to do and so you will simply make this halo class evolve to match the path and what are the operation needed okay so today what we will do is we will use spring boots with multiple layers so a layers to expose the api spring mvc and the persistent layer so of course we target the persistence layer to talk to cassandra but let's first have the app working with to-do list in memory and so to work with memory we use the hashmap object in the java world and so we will create the api and we will make sure that these spi's is working but is working in memory and this is part two so if i go to the readme in part two look at that so first he asked me to create a crud controller so if i go to an existing uh if i go to an existing api hopefully is is working so see here i do have the sample response from the api so the api we need to build need to unscrew something like that okay so i can even open that in a new tab just to have this formatting done automatically by a json view which is a plugin in my browser so okay so a to-do has a url title completed an order all right so now we know what the bin should look like so the first things to do then is to create a bin called to do uvalu id title complete order zero okay so let's create a new a new folder to do okay data stacks workshop to do okay and i will create a new file to do the java okay and i will simply provide these class and if you are already java if you are already some experience with java see there is no more getter setter constructor just providing the data annotation from block make your life easier and it's even working in this cloud environment because i have wired the longbox vs code extension already okay so this is a to-do uh we also want to create the controller i mean the api so now in the same folder i will create this class and of course i don't expect you to create the full rest controller in 10 minutes okay there are some you know let's say 5 to 10 operation to implement so what i give you instead is just the empty the file that is already wired and i want you to implement each operations so i go there i go there and so now what i would like to do is see okay so this is the get which is find all to do as of now it's returning null i want you to find a proper data structures in java in memory that would store these to-do and help us create the api without any database so we will use the hashmap so private map the string to use the uid maybe maybe just uuid because it's and i will use let's say to do this and i will learn to do a new concurrence yeah it's a bit hashmap okay okay so this is just a map key value uid and to do and first find all well find all is not difficult i will simply say i want all the values okay and i want that as a stream okay this one is pretty easy yeah i do i find all cool what else next is find by id and you give me a uid as a string okay and you expect to have a to do or probably have an error if it's not there so you will say you know if to lose dot get and so it's a uid so let's say uuid dot from string the uid uh okay let's say contain key okay if the guy is there i will return it so i will to do dot get okay okay and so on and so forth and if it's not there you will simply return like a response yes let's say response dot let's say uh not found sc not found yeah something like that and we can find the uh constructor to create this response entity and see moving forward we can do that for every single function so we can create a new one we can update an existing one we can delete one and each time oh see this is how to invoke so the not found i will probably do something like that and instead that i will say not found okay not found and for this guy he's need a response entity so i will simply probably say response entity awk and just provide a new response entity dot ok in that body i want that guy and just all together we did find by id and we did find all but you know moving on of course the the the purpose today is not you to do all the operations within these in-memory data structures we simply don't have time to to to do that you can try on your own properly um if you look at the instruction of course i'll give you the solution so give me show the solution and so i can open the solution and let's see uh get to do not found build response yeah not bad i mean the solution is cleaner than my solution but it's already something working so let me copy the contents of this file in my okay all right and here i have implemented the specification okay it's not happy t dot set url so okay yeah to do like that is not enough i mean it should be or i probably should i probably should compile but you know what i will also pick the to do class so let's go here preview there this is my to-do okay so it's also have maybe some oh saturday oh yeah okay i got it the idea is if you look at a sample response coming from an existing uh application let's see where do i have that we did that together or it's there right see i do have a url block and so the url needs to be wired to the environment where we are anyway so we do have the controller we do have the bin so i should be able to start the app finger across and run the specification against this guy and if everything's okay this the it should pass okay so let's see you know here i was giving you a hard time cedric and i was i was messing with you and then i realized i muted my mic because i had lawn people outside you couldn't hear me good for you right next time i will meet you okay so here for instance if i want to list all the to-do's it's empty okay if i want to create a to-do i will just execute the command so see curl is available curl is available as well in in the git pod okay so read the to do okay that's weird because i should have to do already so let's see maybe okay yeah i need to refresh like that so what i did i use curl to create a new to do and i then invoke the endpoint to list all the to do and as you can see i do have one which is sample task sample task okay so but you know we don't like to interact with curl to test some uh endpoint but see here you do have a sample for every single create read update delete operation now what we want to do is really execute the specification so remember this specification tool okay this guy we want to provide the url of our i mean your application running so to have the name of the application running gp url 8080 okay and the path is like slash api slash v1 slash to do so if i go there slash i think it's v1 api to do right so let's see let's see let's see let's see api slash v1 slash 2d api slash v1 slash to do with the s magenta toucan nice okay okay let's see and i still okay okay not bad not bad oh there we go yeah so seems like my in-memory implementation it's working pretty good and you know if i go back here and list my to-do now i do have multiple those are the sample tests that is provided by this test runner so not bad not bad so now if i move from the cl the spec to the client see i do have blah blah blah so if i add a new task cedric and i go here and update the the task i do have in memory i should have my cedric blabla cedric is there okay so we have just created a rest api that work only in memory using spring boot and using a web ui you know providing by two backend so now the time has come to change from this in-memory implementation to a real database and if you understand the inversion of control principle for spring what we will do is we will stay with these api layers and we will change the way we do the persistence okay so let's see test your controller i did that already play with your implementation i did that as well and so i'm done with part two and i can move to part 3 but before that first i will wait for you but also i will do a little bit of slide yes so when we do these in astra um they literally take like two minutes maybe um we also you know before we do these workshops we might pre-provision some things to prepare uh for that but no it's it's seriously fast uh with astro that's kind of one of the reasons why we do with these so let's see the part of the the the point of uh low berlin is really to say okay if you are done with part two don't wait go to park yeah create the database i missed that good point yes good point you know uh distributed the database creation over a 10 minute period it's better than everybody go at the same time create a strategy yeah very true yeah i totally missed this point but it's a good one but you know as david stated we know that we will run those workshops we anticipated let's say 120 people live attendee with us 50 will do the exercise so uh the engineering team has already you know 50 to 100 astra instance pre-baked for that to be as fast as possible during the workshop so thank you to the astro engineering team i know that they are watching us on every stream so yeah thank you to be there and make those workshops successful okay and when you're done with part two please give me a thumbs up i know i was fast but in the end look at that i simply copy paste the solution and so should you and it's pretty cool you do have a working app and you simply have created a single class now if you cannot cope with the pace check out part three and you will be exactly at the same uh based on me i i forgot to say that but when i move to part two to part three all my changes are dropped because i use some pretty effective git command which is get fetch all get reserved hard so that's simply you know drop everything that you did and uh start fresh with the uh branch part start point so you know if you can keep up as i told you it's not a big deal just go to the bottom and move to the next part and i am seeing a couple thumbs up just a couple though yeah i think we should probably wait for a couple more yeah of course of course you know i mean we are doing good on time so we should take our time because as of today it's only spring good so we still need to talk about cassandra and spring data so tony matthew and youtube just asked a great question what will be the value of cassandra.contact points here to connect spring data and cassandra oh that's a good point but in astra it's a software as a service in the cloud and so instead of providing a contact point you will provide another parameter named secure connect bundle it's a zip file and in the zip file you will have a certificates that will open the connection between you and astra instance you need this zip and strong authentication using certificate because you want a two-way communication between you and astra just to do all the magic that the drivers tends to do load balancing else check um paging if you need to open the http each time and close each time yeah it's slow but with these uh secure connect bundle the sql session will be open and stay open and you can do the execute as you would do if you target a contact point and local customer so it will be left empty contact points you don't need a compact point the only parameters you need to access astra or the secure connect bundle a username and a password and just saying pay attention maybe it's part of the question in the end just saying so use intelligent eda that's a good point you can use that and um we're just starting the project to integrate more astra with intellij you know it will be kind of the data grid stuff where you can navigate through the table in intellij it's coming this year yeah tony no problem all right i'm seeing a couple more thumbs up and we do have effective cruise so congrats i know i'm moving fast so if you can keep up great so all right more thumbs up coming in cool yeah so good congrats rushy chest beer cool wonderful tony of course oh tony won't already put some contact points so you know that's a very good question okay so let's say two more minutes uh let's at 20 let's move on um very two slides even maybe one slide and back to the exercise with part three see today is more enzyme that theory in the end we give you tons of resources for you to check this out no more more advanced uh samples or simply tutorials and and back to the buildings what is gas online switch wow that's just a rain oh everybody pick a sun up now maybe they are not ready they simply want me to move like stop talking come on move show us some stuff all right okay so i feel like i can move on so um you do have the to-do app working uh you match the specification but it's still working in memory and when we need to do is simply update the to-do list repository java class to now use cassandra but i don't want to install cassandra so i will show you how to spawn a cassandra instance in astra astradadas.com which is custom razor service in the cloud and because its software as a service we are running the database for you that's right so as a developer it's pretty neat because you simply click a button and you have the running uh database the service is free okay you don't have to provide any credit card you can even use your github account you go there and there is a free tier with five gigabytes of data and it's free forever you never provide any credit card now of course on the astra platform you also have other tiers if you want to scale the strength of custom raspberry to scale out so if you want multiple nodes or nodes in multiple regions over the world you will use extra tears you don't know what i'll go outside no no because you attended this session and if you stay up to the end i can give you 300 bucks of credit on the astra platform so stay tuned it will be probably two minutes in the end that will drop the link to get that credits and you know i don't know if you're planning to do etc but if you've already got astr up maybe it would be good at some point for jasper and others who were looking at that to just show well how do you get the rest end point how do you get the graphql endpoint it's it's seriously easy and it's already there so when you spin up your astra database you've already got we started when i spawned my database okay cool so when he goes to spawn it so for those who are interested in that uh just keep a watch out it is ridiculously easy um so um i found that um i mean i actually like working with the drivers and such but er i could just spin up and use rest or graphql or something i don't have to worry about the drivers anymore uh for my cassandra implementation so it's really kind of awesome yeah so and you know jack already answered the question avinash but if you want to use atl or you know bc cd choosing astra yeah you provide a credit card and a debit credit card will work um yes it will and if you do have the 300 credits you won't even get charged until you reach your credit limit so you know when you register the cb it will you know ask for zero dollar just to validate that the the debit card is okay and you will be uh good to go yeah that's super easy okay so but you know david you already said that multiple time astra runs casa on the rabbit not only on top of cassandra our goal is to make you cassandra as simple as possible so not only we are running the software for you we also providing tools like the sql console we will use that in a minute to create tables that are interact and also api if you are javascript developer python developer maybe you don't like to use the drivers you would like to invoke api and so there there are a proxy on top of castle and the proxy is called stargate open source stargate io you can run that on your local customer then you do have rest api graphql api document api so you can also read and run json from cassandra now using this proxy pretty cool loader and also some apis for um devops so if you are the kind of people that like automate you know ansible terraform api so there is a devops api for you to automate the provisioning of astra instance okay so moving on database let's go so part three part three is really creating your database so go to astro okay so either has cardboard.com or use the link in probably use this link click there and create your database if you already have one database create a new key space and start working with that if you already have the database because you can only have a single free instance do not use the serverless please it's still in beta so you can run into travel it's a beta features so keep it free you know the first one is totally okay so three select the cloud provider so because it's a free tier only google cloud would work and the reason is under the hood aws and azure are more expensive so for the free tier v so select a region so the region that is the closest to you that will have the latency between you and but you know what uh it will be the closest to git pod because this is git pod that will run stuff i don't know where your bit pods so you can pick any of those two it doesn't really matter you know when uh tony tony matthew again in youtube has a question is astra free tier free for one year no limit no limit it's indefinite that's free forever um so a matter of fact a really nice way and a fun way to use the free tier especially for development when you're experimenting and let's say you're just figuring out your data model or you're just getting the plumbing hooked up to your app or whatever then you can spin up those feature databases as much as you want and even once you already have a database created you can create n number of key spaces from that point on right so if you have multiple projects or something you can totally do that but there is no limit so have fun yes exactly no limit have fun and so we are creating to-do key space you can provide your own keys no problem but then when we do the exercise you would have to set up the app to use your keys if you use the same keys as me when you check out the branch it's already set up okay so to key space to do user okay to do user and uh to do password let's see so the values are provided in the readme of course okay and then create a database so let's see if uh mr lin was okay and i would need three minute for the database to be okay so as you can see my the status of my database is pending um and i do have a orange dot over here and as soon as the db is ready it will be it will switch to active mode okay so it's starting losing at the okay it's spending all right and so yeah okay next step is to download this zip all right okay so my database is active so i did not measure but i feel it less than a minute so i can either click on the database name here or connect okay so here you do have the summary of your database so it's a five gigabyte three forever this is the cluster id my username i use gcp and this is my key space and as david stated we can use multiple key spaces so even if you do have multiple projects you can still use the free tier for multiple projects simply create new key spaces so you you can access you can have access to else which is a graphene dashboard just to show you all the queries that has been done but you know it will be probably it will be empty i've just created my db so it will be okay well i do have one node up but of course i do not have any requests i have just created uh mydb okay and now if i want to connect to this database so you can either use the driver and this is what we will do today so node.js python java c-sharp c spruce you know data stacks is famous in the cassandra world not only to commit and create a lot of code for the cassandra database itself but to provide the drivers and so here are all the drivers to interact with cassandra but apis are provided as well so rest api graphql api document api and so here you do have the environment variables you may want to use those are the parameters to use the api and here there you do have multiple sample code sample calls so get a token and start using the api so we won't go there today because today spring data and spring data using java driver but hey you can go there document api graphql rest api they are all there for you to play okay so now let's go to java so give me java what i need to do is to download the secure bundle so download button and here right click secure connect bundle so i noticed that my screenshot is not up to date with this very ui but it's pretty close so really click on java download secure bundle and here just uh save copy link address okay in my clipboard i now have the address of this cloud secure printer okay i will now use this address to download the secure bundle in git pod so this time there is no magic i you need your zip to connect to astra so what you do is see curl dash l yearling slash tmp crate so let's do it i will curl dash l don't forget the quote double quote okay i'm pasting from my clipboard see double quote and i redirect this output to slash tmp slash creds dot zip all right and now i do ls just to check that the file has been downloaded and is about 12k 12 kilobytes okay 12 kilobytes because you know sometimes with timeouts or firewalls or search you may just download the page telling you that create is not available please refresh your page when it's done it's done the slash tmp slash cred it's there so let's move on now i think we do have everything we need to start connecting our app to astro all right so first is go to src main resources applications and properties in a spring boot application all variables and configurations are part of application.properties could be application.properties or application.yaml boot understand both and so what i what i will what i already implemented is a way to load these key from this file and to use that to initialize the connectivity to astra so look at that the key space name if you copy paste the value you don't have to change anything to do user same to do password one same key to be filled when it comes to the secure connect bundle if you again copy paste slash tmp slash quite deep you're good to go so you don't even have to change anything there now notice that in the spring boot world everything worked by convention so really spring boot starter cassandra expect keys to be spring the data that cassandra did something and so spring.data.com username password those are keys uh expected by spring data kassandra springboot starter it's a long it's a long library but this is how the magic can happen to set up your spring boot app to work with gasoline integration proof promotion graffana db under the hood sure because you sh you see the graffana you see the grafana plugin and it's based on open source solution named kate sandra so you can go to kate sandra dot io k8 double s android dot io and here you can see that uh customers are running in kubernetes and uh pro material graphene is already wired now when something working in astra can you plug your own prometheus i'm not sure i need to ask to the engineering team maybe yeah i'm not sure i'm not sure it's a software as a service so access are limited but at the same time here is simply astral pushing you some metrics you know for you to monitor the request and i guess when it comes to billing you want to have your own copy of how many requests you did against astra good question okay moving on so really i don't have to set up keys here i can move on and so i can try to execute maven test in this class so if i open this class so src test java i did this and what i do is i initialized the sql station which is the object to interact with cassandra and instead of providing contact points as tony mentioned before i will provide the cloud secure bundle path which is slash tmp slash credits unzip because i use another nice feature from spring is load values in a property file and make that available as an attribute in the class like that so here i know i do have the path and i will simply use the pass and execute that so if everything is okay i should be able to copy paste that and connect to azure hey okay connection established things as moving now gitbod is connected to astra or have some way to connect to so now we simply i mean we simply we need to implement the api and we would be good to go connectivity is there okay so exercise number two is create the table and the expected schema because if you look at your to-do application in the cafe world you will create the tables based on your queries the apple we always start with the application and build tables based on the queries but if you look at the queries we need for the to-do application it's very very simple you want to list all tasks create a new task mark a task by complete and complete all those operation can be done with a simple id you can simply get by id save by id and then delete all find all because those queries are very simple you only need one table okay so if you use the workflow to define a proper cassandra data model which is and will be different from rationale okay so please look at the youtube channel some cassandra database cool season station there it's very different from russian okay don't try to think like russian all right so you use them the conceptual data model application workflow and use some rules to go to the physical data model and so queries you saw that here so i'm simply using all the rules to create the to-do task table using a uid as a uuid we can be the full primary key both primary key and partition key okay for people uh already familiar with casana a title which is a text completed which is a flag boolean and the offset which is the order of your task index and so here you do have a statement in sql cast android query language to create your table okay in the key space to do app we will create a table name to do task all right so to do it api db ui we're good to go we will use the driver okay contact points i talk about that quickly you need to download the cloud secure bundle to open this two-way tls connection between you and astra no more ready to know and when you open the sql session you will use with cloud secure button and this is what we did in test number one and in test number two we will create the table so part 3.2 3.3 this is exactly what i'm doing right now so i will go there and execute should create expected table okay so let's see if i go to the class create expecting table connection established table to do has been created build success so i'm again injecting all the values i'm opening the sql session and i'm using a statement to create something create table and provide all the values from the table that i just show you right here okay i just execute this command against astra using the secret station okay okay so now if i move to sql cons to astra and go to sql console so remember i told you that astro provides you not only uh cassandra but also tools so sql concern is one of the tools so what i would like to do is first describe key spaces to see what other key spaces available well i put s as described okay so one of the key space is to do key space so if i describe to the key space now you can see that now we do have a table with to do and exactly the schema i just show you in the slide and if i want to see what in what is in this table uh i will do something like that uh select start from i always forget the form okay so it's not a recorded video okay i'm doing in front of you yeah right you know first glitch after one hour you're not bad and it's just me fat finger for getting one keyword okay so we do have the table and the table is empty now our job is to create the java code to fill this table and so to do so back to git pod keep doing keep doing this would put you like connect the application to astra so here it comes i told you spring data cassandra do things in magic way so because the cassandra drivers is present in the class pass spring data customer will try to create this sql session and what we want simply to say to spring data is okay when you try when you build this sql session object magically don't forget to add this cloud secure bundle and so we simply have to create a bin cloud sql station build builder customizer this is part of spring data kassandra and with that when spring data initialize it will use the connect bundle so it should be in the conf folder so java new okay so java com datastax workshop i create a new folder conf i create a new classes spring data java okay so here it is new file okay and i will copy paste the contents here um so it's a configuration class that will tell spring data please use also the cloud secure bundle to connect to astro okay and now because we set up spring data we now can commence the exclude we did in the beginning remember we say customer data to preparation exclude exclude now because we set up spring data we should simply go to the main class and uh just drop the exclude up and with that okay i should be able to start the application and at startup it will connect to astronaut right now it's not doing anything that the last part implement the code but only i mean it's not only with that by uh by setup spring data i should now be able to go there and start my app oh okay so first a test load context just okay let's just test to see if if i can connect so let's see okay def workshop spring okay okay test run one failure zero okay so my app can connect to astra so let's go maven spring boot run let's go okay so now the application is running but it's still working in memory now we need to change the to do repository class to use cassandra and not in memory so let's see what we have to do okay this is where spring data come in very handy so spring data is a om framework object mapping you want to work only with java object and make sure that spring data will save your object in the database retrieve the object in the database and we'll do what we call the marshalling moving your object as a sql statement and back a result of a query up to an object so spring data is really mapping from object to tables it's not orem object rational mapping because there is no relation in cassandra but it's object mapping okay so now this is the uh the persistence layer will both use the datastax driver we want the one we just used to connect to create tables but also we'll do more and we'll do the mapping object tables okay um i won't go into too much detail here spring boot starter data casana expect some keys to initialize the sql station as i show you already so spring data customer key space name username password and you know this guy is just us uh creating the spring data config class and just added that on top of it okay if in your java application you already defining a sql session bin with your own properties spring data will use your bin no problem spring boot starter tata cassandra always only create the sql session if you don't have the sql session yourself in your configurations classes and this is what we just did okay no configurations classes so it will use those keys by convention to create the object security session okay when it comes to mapping from entity to tables so we will create some annotation on the to do on the it's here it's task but it's to do object let's say okay um in the tables we just created uid is my primary key and it's the id and for the others string is a text complete is a boolean asset is in i don't have anything else to to say it's enough now when it comes to create some queries in this table we will extend crud repository create with update delete repository all the default available on this table simply provide the bin and the primary key of the bin as generics when you extend this default cred repository and there this is where it's become very powerful by default all this crowd repository already have as the name stated find by id find all read update delete cred and you can add your own queries so here is a sample i simply add find by task id something like that and i put an annotation at query pay attention there is no implementation here it's still the interface and that the spring data magic that will run this interface at load time create some uh cg proxy so you know class is needed and when you invoke this interface remember in version of control you don't care about the implementation well as a matter of fact the implementation is generated by spring letter i load time so you don't have to bother which is pretty neat now you only need to have an object and the query you need to execute and with that you're good to go so let's see what it look likes and we will move and then we will close the end zone with these two samples okay so let's see how much time do i need to make that happen alright so the app is working let's move to part four let's do part four which is okay we are in part four let me close everything except the readme let's start properly okay clean clean clean clean okay we're good we're good we're good okay we start and here clear okay we are good let's open readme i will i want the readme as a preview so i click here i just drag okay object mapping so first i need to update my to-do uh with to-do entities so in previous step we created tool entity while not dealing with resources now let's annotate these two entities so go here and here um so true entity okay with no annotation so what i would like to do is uh where is my guy okay to do entity and mapping that okay so this is to do entity so what i do i using a at table okay to the entity um it is a best practice to define all the keys as environment as constant here because then if you want to rename one column you will only have to change this constant so here primary key and then i put the name and the type of each column okay i updated the uh to the entity i now created a new repository to have all operations to interact with this to-do entity so i think in uh okay in the to-do folder create that guy hey cedric i do have a question for you uh here from subra in um youtube forget by id do we need to use the query as there is a default implementation in jpa repo uh doing no we don't need the query the query was there just to illustrate you in the slide what is possible but look at that right look i'm i'm building these repo and the repo is empty as you spot it i have no need to provide any query because it's provided by default beginning is omitted geez come on and so that's all you can go with the implementation and i will stay with that and you know what uh and you need test of the implementation media um oh geez i cannot copy paste or really you know i'm lazy i will go to part five and i will go and pick this these classes you know keep lazy go to the next okay it's to do and i want this guy hey that's what those are for right i mean yeah so you know i didn't put the important package but you know what okay so this is my guy all right so as uh stated by subrajit there is no need to provide the it's already there part of the cassandra get repository idea i don't want to do the simple customer repository because i don't need to car operation with sql session and so to to this is um now want to leverage shipping boot to any silicon say and just the following code copy code to replace to do i can spring that application test so where is my test to do applications spring data okay this guy and i should remove and change with this to do back and bring that application test into the same yes the same name class so it's a spring boot test okay so it will load everything from spring oh it's already there okay let's do that shoot save task when save so what i'm doing is i'm creating i'm creating a new entity using the constructor and i save okay so let's see i will now execute the test so let's see what i miss if i don't miss anything save in casama with the save 0 which mean now if i look at my table i do have the record because spring data with the save just now have created the record in the database so i've switched back to and now my data is there so i'm pretty happy because i do have a cred repository that can interact with this table the last frontier is to map or to connect this repo to the api so let's see uh we did that uh in portland if you adapt the rest controller yeah you know what show me the correction okay to do rest controller so what we do here we inject the to-do repository classes in the controller and instead of using the hashmap i'm using the repo defined by id it's all included in um it's all included in spring data so if i go there update my to-do rest controller with these values hopefully i will save now if i start my app and run my unit test my specification test again it will work as expected and create some stuff into so can i just maybe even start the app and i'm will be happy so okay i'm starting the app and i will execute the unit test here there i know so now i'm executing the unit test but instead of updating the hashmap in memory i'm updating the database so if i go to astra now the tasks are there and created in real time and now we do have the full app working so if i go to uh let's say the client now okay i do have blah blah blah okay let's see i want a new task cedric and your new task workshop and if i go to astra and list the task in my tables now see i do have state ric and workshop so with that congratulations and a ui on top of it to interact with custom using spring data customer okay so we just did all the all these layers all the steps from this only uh it's only the branch four in branch five what we do is we simply add some documentation on top of the api i won't go into the detail that's just a bonus exercise for you all because with the let's say 10 minutes remaining we will now play games and search uh so you know david you talk about uh this is what we did astra is running cassandra and we use the drivers used by spring data used by spring boots okay this is exactly what we did today in astral we do have the stargate so not only we do have this the driver sql but also rest api document api and graphql api and if i put everything in astra this is what it looked like in astra you do have rest api document and the drivers you can use with spring data and spring boots and the devops api okay and uh you know what i'm currently coding you know during my evening just sdk to implement a client in java to interact with those api and for it like that you don't have to read the api documentation you simply use the sdk it will show it will be available pretty soon all right thank you for attending if you like this content you can you know go so either use the link provided by jack in the slack right now just to subscribe to all the events that's coming you can also go to datastax.com workshops and see what's coming next week and the week after so as you can see next week we will do the serverless game and then we will do kate sandra kubianetes and quarkus shameless plug for next week is jam stack right we're going to do jam stack where it's all serverless across the board i mentioned that document um a documentdb on cassandra through astra through stargate actually we're going to be doing all that next week so we are moving over into the javascript world with react and redux and such i know this is java crew i just probably spoke blasphemy but if you are interested in that please come right because again these are free it's free information um go to the registration page just to see that super cool animation and video just teasing you hey ryan did a great job um thank you very much for being with us today if you like subscribe and otherwise see you soon see everybody and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of cassandra who grew those powers until she can multiply it will move with limitless speed and unmask hidden knowledge with those powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous beats",
