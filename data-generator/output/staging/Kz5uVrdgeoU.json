    "text": "uh hello we've got uh we're set up and going here uh we're just going to give it uh like literally 30 seconds here uh and and then we'll kick it off because uh thanks to all of you who have arrived uh on time and gotten your technology to work but that doesn't always happen for everybody so we will just give it a couple of minutes here or a couple of seconds more basically 1801 is what I'm going to he one minute pass so and you're up and going there Matthew yeah let me see if I can the screen so long yeah yeah yeah uh cool that should be the slideshow hopefully slideshow and We're Off to the Races just about excellent thanks so much uh everyone for joining us here uh my name is Phil measley I'm a developer advocate here at data stack and I'll be kind of co-hosting this with Matthew uh topic of tonight is uh unlocking the power of SEI or storage attached indexing uh and Vector search so kind of how that combines together in the world of Astra uh as a powerful way of searching metadata in a way that maybe you haven't quite seen being used before here so go to the next slide here just do quick introduction of myself uh I am a developer advocate here at DX and I've been an Enterprise architect DBA Ops Enterprise architect I've done lots of stuff over the past number of years all very much to do with data uh and so uh I'll introduce you here to Matthew who can introduce himself sure thanks uh yeah I'm Matthew uh my current role is head of engineering at Hornet um we're kind of a small team so it kind of includes a lot of hats um but you know implementing features at scale focusing on the kind of scalability and security um keeping our development pipelines running and then just you know making all making sure all of that stays in in in budget uh kind of encompasses my roles there um yeah excellent thank you uh so then just to cover off the agenda here we're going to spend a little bit of time on what what is Vector search but not get too deep into it the assumption is most people here are familiar with what Vector searches are and you're interested about the and Si indexing uh and so we'll do a bit about a hornet uh intro and demo we'll go into a technical Deep dive um so I've got a kind of working application that's not it's it's open source you can go and download it and play with it yourself uh on a code that's kind of based on what Hornet is doing but not exactly uh talk a little bit about future plans and we'll have some time for Q&A at the end so on to what is Vector search um and I think the first slide is like a dead one next one here oh slide yeah what is a vector okay so Vector quite simply is a list of numbers uh but it's a numeric representation of some set of generally kind of unstructured data could be text image video audio any other number of things and embedding is kind of a specific representation of that much like you have different human languages representing Concepts uh and embedding is just a way of doing that with the goal of capturing the meaning of that thing text image video Whatever uh into a list of numbers that capture the semantic meaning and the context of that that's typically what a an embedding will contain and it's processed by uh machine learning model usually uh and so those ml models are used to create embeddings and then other ml models can often then consume those because their computers they like lists of numbers so those are there we go objects in objects out as vectors and you've got the embedding model which does that next slide great this is just an example of that with a text embedding um so you've got your raw text there that has some sort of meaning to us we could talk this is basically an idea about how you create a token within the aster database uh and the result of the embedding model is a list of numbers that has all of that okay and next slide Vector search is saying well okay I have this thing here and I want to find other things that are similar to it so in this representation we have some clothing so it's you know an embedding space of blue to red and shirts to pants and and so if I was looking for something in this I might be looking for a shirt in which case I'm going to be looking to the top half of the graph or I might be looking for something more on the bottom that the pants which is something towards the bottom and it looks like the in this representation a skirt is something closer to a shirt than it is a a pants because that's further up the chart uh and there's a spectrum of colors here so if I want to then go and try to find out uh find a shirt uh I will create a semantic embedding of the shirt that I have I want to find a shirt that's similar to this shirt and I could go and search for that or I could say hey look I want to find red clothes and we could go use the text of red clothes and find the shirts that are red um based simply on that Vector uh search so we have a query that we want to make we turn that into a vector with the same embedding model we now do a search in our database to find all of the vectors that are similar to that and we bring those back and kind of decode them into things that are visually more meaningful to us as humans rather than lists of numbers okay next up then Hornet over to you Matthew cool cool thanks Phil yeah so um I'll chat a bit about what Hornet is so it's essentially a social networking and dating app um I put some screenshots on the right hand side just of kind of our grid and our feed uh showing the kind of social networking side and then the more kind of dating side the the classic W Horn of star datas uh founded in 2011 um at the moment we've got about 700,000 daily active users uh who send about 19 million messages daily so uh quite a lot of data happening there um and we're here to talk about kind of how we're using AI uh so at Hornet we've got I mean I think it's similar to everyone else we're trying to kind of get as much AI in as we can and see what kind of works uh we've got a couple things that we're currently working on uh recommendations which I've put in them in bold here because it's the one that kind of primarily uses our the vector search um you can kind of imagine how full mentioned you know you have the pants and the things and we wanted to kind of apply that idea to different people based on you know your profiles uh we do a lot of work with moderation I mean that's just basic image moderation but we're also starting to look into using the LMS themselves um to do things like that uh and then wingman which is another thing we're using which is kind of primarily open AI uh forward to suggest chat but yeah we're talking about recommendations today so um I'll head on to that so I've got a a quick demo here hopefully it loads um I made a video because I'm not going to taunt the demo Gods like full later but hopefully it'll kind of give a gist of of how it works so I've got a staging environment here uh where hopefully you can kind of see I've got a little profile uh it's got some dummy data about surfing on it um and then if I head to the feed we've got a little recommendations Carousel which has a few people in it uh these are all just kind of dummy accounts that I set up you can kind of have a look at all of them there's uh lots and lots but the one that's right in front is about surfing and there's you know another one about dogs and cats uh these are kind of just some dummies I set up again just to show the the ordering and kind of give an idea of how this kind of works uh so if I go update the profile uh change it from being about surfing to something about cats I think yeah then hopefully uh this kind of updates the vector so the reason this was done kind of in a stage environment is because the vectors update right away there uh in production we have a bit of a delay uh mostly for kind of cost uh implications but yeah so you can have a look at the the vectors there switched around and it's now recommending the cat guy to me first um the rest of the profiles have done me information about cheese or something I think that's why these ones kind of pop up to the front um in production it's a lot more nuanced uh we throw a lot more data into those embeddings uh so this is just an example of production environment uh my test profile which has uh basically says I'm part of the development team and these are the recommendations that it's kind of got for me um from some of the profiles we've included in the experiments uh yeah top one you know similar age uh is a research assistant travel that kind of thing so a lot of these profiles actually have things that only I would know kind of relate to my profile which is the whole idea behind kind of our recommendations uh that instead of you know just randomly getting a grid of guys you get ones which are hopefully uh optimized or prioritized to your kind of uses um so how that actually works is kind of what we want to cover today uh we've got a awesome old rails monolith uh so this is just an overview of essentially how it works uh there's a lot on the slide that you don't need to really focus on any of it so don't worry uh the main thing is that when users come online which is the top half uh we kind of check if they have a vector uh representing them or generated from their profile or one that hasn't been updated recently uh if so we kind of kick off Vector generation which is then going to generate an embedding exactly like how full described earlier where you take a bunch of stuff and you generate a vector from it and then you store that uh to use for recommendations later and then the bottom one uh half is basically when anyone opens the app like the feed like you saw in the demo or the grid uh we go grab the recommendations for the user based on their location and then obviously doing the vector search which we'll CH about in a sec uh we pull that either from a cache um if we have it or we hit Astra and do the the vector magical Vector search which then pulls out the recommended profiles uh just kind of a again an overview of how it works we take all the user info bio age looking fors we throw that to an LM uh in our case we use open AI uh which I think we have Linked In the resources here but you could use any LM I mean llama 2 or Gemini one day Google ever Google ever apis that uh you could use anything to kind of generate your vectors obviously just the size changes based on which llm you use um open AI is like 1536 I think so it's a lot of numbers so the hope is that it kind of embeds a lot of nuanced information uh which will give us better recommendations um so the ual hardcore Cassandra code that that kind of makes that work in Astra uh is here it's basically just creating a table uh and you can have a look there it kind of includes in our case because uh we don't want to recommend all the profiles we want to recommend the ones that are nearby to the user because you know recommending you someone in in Russia or Indonesia if you're sitting in Brazil isn't going to be very helpful so uh that's where the kind of SII index stuff comes in we have your profile ID lat long the actual embedding that represents that user um and then the profile ID uh we have the SII indexes on Lattin long which is what we use to kind of uh box that down uh and then the magical Vector index at the bottom which actually does the kind of vector search part for us uh in our case we use SI indexes on that and long because like I said we're kind of using kind of Geo area um but you could you know use SI indexing for a multitude of of ways to kind of scope down your vector search as to specific things like you could have if you have you know a whole bunch of documents in all different languages and you want to Vector recommend on English you could have an SE index on language or something like that um then the kind of uh queries that run on that after you do this uh for inserting it's very simple just basic SQL essentially where you just stuff the profile vectors in there uh and then querying also just straightforward SQL uh the magic bit uh is the order by embedding Ann of which does the actual Vector search but the rest of it is essentially just just filtering um on these s indexes um and the really cool thing is that those work together so you can have lots of s indexes uh and a vector index and they work together well um so yeah we've been experimenting with this for a little while now uh we've seen some pretty good results um they're not like you know super blowing out the water uh but we can see that kind of guys followed and guys viewed uh chat's pretty static uh but at least for following and viewing they're increased for the people that have the recommendations enabled which kind of gives us evidence that they're seeing higher quality profiles are ones that are interested in more um so there's a lot more for us to do here but uh so far we're seeing uh evidence that there's definitely something there um which we'll hopefully working more on um so that's kind of how we're using it at Hornet kind of brief overview with a few technical details uh there's a lot of ways to use S indexes um and yeah pH I think you you got a demo of a a bit more of a modern stack uh and something that's open source so people can actually kind of play with if they want per perfect okay now is there a way I think you need to stop sharing so I can start sharing yeah excellent and Screen here this screen here here great uh I assume you can now see my lovely map of Dublin are you able to see my map du there yep eventually there okay so uh what I've done here is taken this idea map of Dublin session for a sec I'm sorry what happened work sorry there's a bit of a delay uh but it's all good okay uh okay so um right so I've taken uh uh the idea of what Hornet's done with people matching and I've used open street map to identify things that are labeled as restaurants and I've used an llm to with a bit of prompting to generate reviews of these restaurants so uh the idea is if I click on this map here I can get number of restaurants within a sort of distance right I could look for 50 restaurants within my click if I wanted to it gets a bigger bigger map here if I could do a broader search as well if I had like um you know 500 here it's you know just large numbers of of restaurants so the idea here if I look within uh you know 500 meters uh eventually yeah I I'll I'll preface well I'll just mention that I am not a uh frontend developer so anything we come up with here is is uh you'll probably do better but if we can kind of zoom in here and we can look and see that I've created these reviews and they you know they're all fake reviews so hence the they're not representative of real world establishments although they are real world establishments um so this is metadata that came to us from open street map that's kind of included in this um not formatted any fancy but you just basically cook around their real restaurants but what's maybe more interesting is if I wanted to look for something uh for semantic search and we're going to do a semantic search on the descriptions here so if I was looking for a ro romantic dinner right I could then click on here and now there's going to be further out matches because all those 10 restaurants that I had here not all of them are necessarily having reviews that have romantic dinner and I've then kind of colorcoded them here so um beef and lobster here's the review that matches perfect for romantic dinner this is a slightly deeper green uh in terms of it's it's based on the similarity score zero to point or to one so this is 0. N4 similarity just on the similarity search that's me mentioned there so that's the basic idea of this um is that I'm combining a semantic search with a radius search on that so now as Matthew said um my rails isn't what it once was which to be honest was never all that great um so this is on node.js that I've built this on uh and I've been doing a number of um you know kind of contributions to the line chain JS project as well to help this there's a this is slightly ahead of Lang change yes there's a PR that's kind of being reviewed um but I'm expecting by the end of this week that PR will be in fully um but that said you can run this in a Docker container uh right now and it'll run perfectly fine it's just you couldn't do an mpm run without doing some hyinks so without getting into too much detail here I am kind of showing off a little bit of some of the deeper level things you can do with Astra uh as well as keeping things a bit simple using line chain so for example here we've defined a table here and I've specified specific columns and this is the SE that we're talking about so where Matthew had the create custom index whatever uh you know type storage attach index uh here's where we can Define that on this coordinates column which is itself a vector of two Dimensions so it say latitude and longitude so Matthews code that he was giving us is talking about a bounding box um but with an astro we can do uh create an index with a similarity function ukian and if it's a two-dimensional Vector we can put a filter on here geodistance so here's where I can pass in to my function uh latitude and longitude as parameters into my function that's being called uh essentially as an API call from from the kind of more front endend part of it um and but again we give it a string that we're going to match on the text the number that we're going to match against uh and a radius around which we we match so uh with that we can run the query here and this is line chain type of stuff right where I'm going to Define my filter I'm going to do a similarity skir search using that filter and then I'm going to basically put them onto the map and return back the uh map of array values so this is this is kind of a list of amenities uh that are matching the score but before that and again there's um uh you know you this where before I put in any kind of reviews I was just doing a search find within radius not using text and so again here I'm just clicking on here and I'm using that same geodistance kind of wear Clause filter to come up with the list of uh amend ities that are within that radius limited to some number of K so uh and then I'm within this code here mapping that into a ly chain document object I'm sure there's better fancier ways of doing this but I'm just trying to throw something together fairly quickly on that and this process amenity results is what ends up putting things you know uh combining our things together and sticking them onto the map so uh within that we then just have another little helpful kind of common class here the Astra connection stuff is all tied in here so um it's not quite what I was hoping to do with this piece of you know kind of demonstration code was less of a oh yeah it's another yet another python you know kind of example demonstration thing but it's actually using languages that people use for real in production if you wanted to have a node or nextjs kind of application uh you could kind of recog ize a lot of stuff in here and be familiar with that and build an application using uh a more common language for building you know frontend applications um so that is the gist of this part here so again the idea is you can create a table here you don't have to do data modeling here as well you can just there's a default version of this where you just take in the text in a vector and you don't have to put anything else apart from a prob tell me what your key is your unique value so you would have to give me the review ID and it will it's a unique value and it will add in the Tex stuff and the vector stuff to do the embedding search but if you want to do uh sais explicitly like this you would need to specify additional column and the index explicitly that's a lying CHS there's other mechanisms like the Json API does a lot of the stuff for you automatically with an ra that allows you to just send in a Json document and everything is indexed automatically for you uh the python uh kind of family of stuff uses there's astroy which is using the jsn API and then there's CIO which is much like line chain here um in JavaScript doing translations to the underlying native cql so you've got some options here but ultimately what we're trying to do is metadata search with additional filtering and so in this case here we're using the geodistance function okay so that's kind of the the Deep dive here and we can do more Q&A on this later but uh if we kind of bring ourselves back to the deck I can stop sharing there we go and back to you Matthew cool let me get the slides back up cool thanks pH yeah so pretty much the the gist of it is uh that you you can get much better results uh with Vector search when you can kind of combine it with some some filters at least for our case and also in this case and there's a million ways to use that um that looks awesome uh I'll uh download the demo and play with it to learn some node.js cool uh yeah so the future and the Beyond uh I mean there's a lot right now and there's so much happening in in the AI space um but specifically with Vector search uh and next with vectors at Hornet um even just with our our recommendations I mean initially we want to kind of roll this out to more users get more feedback and then update kind of our our prompts or how we're generating those vectors to make sure that we're getting kind of optimal um recommendations back apart from that uh there's a lot more ways to use it that we exploring um just kind of uh two of the the things that we're busy working on are uh using it in the other direction so instead of people kind of requesting these recommendation vectors uh when we make a new recommendation Vector for a new user or someone who's come online in a long time and we get their Vector back we want to try to reactivate profiles or bring people back into the app by you know getting a radius around them of of of the people who uh they most match and then peeing those people and saying hey there's a new match near you um and another use is also bot and spammer detection um the idea there being if we have these vectors that represent these profiles really well uh and we've had some kind of undesirable profiles and we suspended those we could probably get vectors uh of those suspender profiles and then do a nearness search and the people most like those are probably also uh Bots or spammers or undesirables uh which we can then you know throw to moderation or or go further with to try and uh pick them up before they get reported or become a problem um yeah other than that I mean tons of things and there we're always com up with ideas um but yeah that's kind of adjusting it uh yeah so I think that's mostly it from from my side Phil uh on on the future stuff uh I think the rest of it is mostly questions um yeah yeah so uh what do we want to what questions might we have in the Q&A please if you've have questions we can open it up we got a lot of time here set aside to be able to do questions and answers so yeah we went way faster than one that's all good um hopefully we we kind of got the gist across uh that you know the the Sai indexes make it really neat to to use Cassandra to to do these kind of filters um with yeah Astro which is kind of magical Cassandra um and then along kind of combining that with Vector search you can kind of get really semantic results uh filtered to what matters most to your user or your use case um and in really performant ways I think I was Benchmark benchmarking it with kind of two million vectors uh and getting results really quickly yeah that's uh uh one of the things to talk about maybe with um Cassandra and asra specifically uh is that it's able to do perform reads and service reads without having any impact C caused by concurrent rights so rights are happening all the time in an application like uh like what you have with Hornet right and you don't want those to be like blocking reads and and they don't in fact and you get the most current upto-date as changes happen uh yep um yeah exactly and that's what we'd want right users coming online yeah get those recommendations right away cool I don't know what else we have from uh chat perspective I don't see anything going on here uh can we use this for e-commerce product search which has a lot of metadata attributes AKA a structured query payload so ran thank you um the answer to that is yes of course so if you wanted to do uh that if if you want to do structured query or unstructured uh data you have have the option to do that can I can I share my screen again please Matthew yes yeah cool excellent um so whoa here we go all kind of zooming in again get S confused so there is um a number of different ways you can do that um so for unstructured data you know we had this example here um this is this is rather very structured data right I've said look here's my columns Etc um but there are data types within Cassandra that are called Maps where you can have a map of text and value and you can query against those maps with the equality searches for example um so if you had a generic kind of version of that and you had structured tables that you wanted to do that would be fine there's also the the Json API um which allows you to uh you know kind of within vectors right we can find collections uh within a vector and if I try figure out the particulars of this this is restful sorts of stuff here um it's probably better to look at at the examples here um in terms of how you can here let me go back to this part here if I go into my Vector database as an example here I can look at connects and apis and Json API uh and we can say how we can do that um this is just IM mongus swager UI API quick start I know there's a version of this here so this is this is uh kind of an API quick start for how you can go about doing that with the Json um API itself um but the basic answer is like Cassandra is a nosql database uh and so as a consequence of the being a nosql database you can use structured data unstructured data uh and uh stop sharing again yeah and and you can do queries against Maps or other sorts of data types okay uh so hopefully that's answered your question about the e-commerce partn Sean uh next uh prene how much see here max volume of data this type of searches are feasible any limits like uh two uh 2i secondary indexes in Cassandra uh no the answer is this uh secondary indexes are kind of limited to being within a partition whereas the storage attach index spans all of your records um and to to answer your question we've completely indexed Wikipedia with Vector searches so over 100 million records and it performs nicely perfectly fine Matthew you were saying you've got two million uh and I kind of yawn at two million records sorry let's get many more right 35 let's get a 100 million out there right um so no there aren't limits uh like there are with Cassandra secondary indexes for uh what type of search is being used when you po a structured query uh what's the time complexity of that search so you're asking is it on order of what um I don't know the exactly Big O kind of notation in terms of that um but as you add more and more conditions onto your search it will increase um I know we're continually doing optimizations on that um but is as you're doing more searches it's what's happening there with additional criteria is it's going and hitting potentially different indexes in G Gathering all that information back and essentially intersecting it all together um in Aster there is an architectural difference between the coordinator that's the thing that's receiving requests from clients and sending responses back versus the writer nodes so it's kind of a scatter gather approach where it will your request comes in we do this index searches and if we have multiple index searches we'll do them all kind of in parallel we'll get the answers back to the coordinator compute the intersection and return the result back um so I'd say it's pretty linear but I'm not going to don't give me a guarantee on that in terms of if you add more is it's not like 1X 2x 3x there's going to be some Factor but it's generally linear okay uh so hopefully that's the answer to that question uh next up is uh on the bot and understandable what's the structure behind the detection oh this is maybe a question to you Matthew yeah I can take that one yeah uh so with the B detection it's essentially just a nearest uh neighbor kind of vector search on in the in theory that we've taken all the profiles text um and also other things like the device the IP address the location that kind of thing and we throw that all into uh the LM and we get a vector that kind of represents user in a lot of ways uh other Bots or spammers or undesirables will have similar uh attributes or devices or IP addresses or locations and things like that so I guess it's more like a a bit of a patent detection I guess uh where we using the lm's vectors um and the nearest neighbor search to kind of pick up things that match that pattern that maybe would be difficult for humans to dig through um or to kind of DOL statements or something to try and figure out exactly what things the Bots have in common uh so just that by doing a neuros Spector search we can pull profiles we might have missed previously um because vector- wise they're really close to bots we have found okay uh so the uh next question here is when will dc7 with Sai and Vector search BGA the short version of that is dsc68 and already has Si in it um but really the more interesting question is when you get Vector search capability that's a feature that is in Cassandra 5.o beta which is currently out and there's a preview release of dc7 which includes uh Vector search uh I don't have the Safe Harbor statement or anything like that but I do I'm just doing a quick look on this here if you can bear with me I just want to confirm a page here uh it's meant to be finalized this week I know that they're working very hard they've been kind of aiming to hit sometime in this quarter is the general aim but I can't like that's kind of gives you a rough idea but there is a preview release of dc7 that if you talk to uh whoever you talk to uh come back to us either Michelle or myself can kind of come back to you with how you get access to the preview release of dc7 so hopefully that answers your uh your question there have we other questions teams not so much not like in slack where you can see people typing I don't have any feedback like that so okay I think if there's other questions here uh we can kind of say look we've been trying to talk about how SEI Works in a real use case thank you very much Matthew for your time here this evening and kind of sharing with us how you're using Astra and and specifically here tonight SII to kind of you know do the bounding box searches and kind of help to do profiles of people that are near you which seems to be a pretty important thing I don't think I'd be interested in dating people that AR like 300 miles away from me right so excellent uh I don't see any other q&as here um no and uh great so I think we can just work on ending the webinar here and thanks all for your time uh Michelle did confirm to us that for those of you that didn't see it that there will be a chat available via the link that we have here and uh so the same link will give you to the recording for those of you that want to see the recording in the future okay great stuff so thank you all for joining us and there's some magical button to hit leave and Michelle will find it bye thank you here cheers everyone thanks",
