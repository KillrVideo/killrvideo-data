and we are happy to greet you here together with us that's alex volchnev developer advocated data stocks today with me very special guest jeff jeffrey carpenter you must know him if you were reading definitive guide on apache cassandra that's his book hi jeff hey alex how are you very good happy to be it's been a while since i've been live on a workshop uh well i i don't want to say but it was uh pre-covet i guess so we did a lot of things in person back in the day but we did a lot a good amount of online workshops too so i'm glad to be back uh joining you today do you want to introduce uh some of your some of your credentials here oh well not really usually we have a lot of the returning guests people who attended our workshops before so hopefully i don't need that and you know what like let's introduce ourselves again in the end but first people care about the code talk is cheap show me the code yeah that's right okay well we're definitely gonna get there today um so we put some contact information out there you know that you can reach us on discord uh direct out there we're monitoring the youtube chat today um so you can reach out and connect with us and uh if you toward the end uh we're actually gonna give you the opportunity to reach out and uh grab grab some meeting time with us uh and i should also mention we have some of our usual crew of uh advocates uh helping us out on the chat with the support today uh as well as chris bradford who is a a leader on the kate sandra team is kind of out there and monitoring so like make bring us your hardest quote your most detailed questions and we'll just redirect them right to chris and he's like cursed you jeff all right with that you know what i have the mic so i can do that all right here's our outline man we have a lot to cover today i'm not even i'm not even totally sure if we can do it all alex um maybe it's a matter of how much i talk so we're gonna we're gonna go through some quick cassandra and kubernetes basics and you know the whole point is not to re-teach you any of those technologies but to highlight some of the connection points um so we need to give a little bit of context in order to do that uh and then we're gonna go through the various elements of what kate sandra is giving you in terms of installing and running a cassandra cluster but then also doing some of the things that you need giving you access from an app dev perspective to various apis including your standard cql api but also some fun new stuff through stargate uh and then some of the operational tasks that you're going to want to perform uh and um alex your master uh your master plan of outline here i'm just going to do the reveal right now we're mixing operations and uh developer topics so it's not it's going to be like a little bit of something for everyone all the time keeping you on your toes no matter what your preference is so should we just do it yeah and i want to notice what like working and development for many many many many years i really tired of ops people who care only about ops and really tired of deaf people who care only about devs that's completely wrong you have to understand other parts of the development to be efficient engineer so take a look at all the steps we are going to do with you today okay good i feel totally debunked but also you're correct um do you want to talk about the the homework and how we're gonna do exercises for this particular workshop alex yeah so take a look uh we are going to try something new well not uh something you asked us for a while already so take a look we today we'll do the live demo of the things we are doing with kate sandra and how it works but we want you not only to watch but we want you also to touch that's very important practice uh theory without practice is just dead and often useless and you forget about everything the next day so we want you to put your fingers on the keyboard push the buttons and work with it if you have a more or less reasonable sized machine so you can run docker um small kubernetes cluster on your own is great if you don't we are even ready to provide you a training cloud instance for free so you can go and do a workshop steps on your own ask your questions on discord or ask your questions later after a workshop yes ask your questions at the community and then if you do all the steps you send us the screenshots and jeff could you please push the button i would love to push the button oh there you go yeah and then for those who are making their practice who makes the workshop today they will receive a special page on linkedin from datastax developers confirming where he or she successfully posted the workshop did the homework and got the fundamentals of apache cassandra with kubernetes proofed by datastax developers so that's not a big certification but it's free and you only have to invest your time and upgrade your skills so that's i hope make you very interested to make this happen i know what a lot of people were only watching workshops but not doing practice we are going to fix that now you are going to do the work not only video work but you too i like it all right good plug we'll talk more about that we'll bring that back to you at the end so yes if you want to follow along right now you know we yeah we've given you the link on github but um it's probably better to watch for right now i would take uh alex's advice okay yep so so let me speak so let's get this rolling with some fun yeah so uh today we as usual have a quiz so you can answer the questions and then some swag and as usual we use menchie.com but for to but first we are going to ask some questions so easiest way to answer the questions of our quiz and us answer our setup questions oh jeff sorry let me shrink you for a moment oops hey nobody puts jeff in the corner [Laughter] sorry dirty dancing reference 90s i mean it's been a long time yeah maybe i should stop my old man jokes so uh jump in uh with your best way to join menti is just open it on your mobile phone with mendy.com and enter the code 7162 or just scan that qr code close to jeff and you will be in you will answer our questions we will realize who have joined the workshop and we will start so first question is what's your experience with cassandra is it a database i have some understanding i use it regularly true guru here okay so looks very not bad i see some people have not so big experience let's say is it a database yes it is it's a great very powerful database use it on the biggest and most interesting and most loaded projects in the world if you are using apple you actually already using cassandra you are watching netflix you're already using cassandra oh you don't like apple you prefer for example huawei the biggest cassandra deployment i would say and so wow instagram yeah instagram is also runs really a lot we have a new leader on the worldwide usage huh yeah yeah indeed uh it was apple before but now we found out what huawei is the bigger one than even when apple in the questions of cassandra users so if you're a beginner uh listen very thoroughly to what what jack says in the beginner jeff says sorry in the beginning then next question what's your experience with dorker you know this workshop is about running cassandra in kubernetes so if you never heard about docker it must be a little bit hard for you um oh we have some docker masters here it's great and uh people if you have some understanding or use it regularly you will be fine uh if you're a docker master when that's great help us answering questions on the youtube chat or in discord and finally if you never heard about that well then it's going to be a rough workshop experience for you because we are talking about pretty complex things but you know what we have a special docker learning path for those who are complete beginners in docker so maybe some of my colleagues would be so nice and put the link to our docker learning path that would be great and then last question before we proceed what's your experience with kubernetes so we know how much you are into that okay so we have people with kubernetes understanding regular usage oh kubernetes rockstar great and we have some people about kubernetes experience which is fine so it's not a kubernetes course but follow us then add the kubernetes workshop from docker learning path and you will be fine no worries oh yeah that's a good that's a good point you've done a great series i think you probably qualify for the kubernetes rockstar i i do not uh well well well well getting there i'm getting getting my kubernetes foo on kubernetes is a very big topic and like kubernetes experience in the different environments will be very different so it's always complicated whom to consider a master or not to consider doesn't matter i think we are ready to start so now yeah i see a few dozens of people join at 90 that's incredible now don't quit because it starts soon and now we are switching to the slides so hi jeff now it's your turn okay get that screen transitioned over and we're gonna be talking now about just enough of the basics of cassandra and kubernetes to start thinking about how we tie them together okay i'm gonna zoom way way way super far out here um you know about 15 ish years ago we started seeing some major trends in how we were all building applications we started talking about the cloud and using uh amazon web services was with you know the first provider where you could actually get access to infrastructure as a service and we started doing all that kind of stuff we started uh doing lots of microservice uh you know dividing up these big monolithic applications into microservices and then you know some of us started using these highly scalable nosql databases like cassandra as our data store so if we think like of these cloud applications as having application code and data and then running on some infrastructure like at a very high level now what's uh what started to happen is that uh there are some architectures that have really uh and some combinations of technology let's say that have really risen to the forefront as the ways to build highly scalable systems so we see uh lots of companies building out microservice tiers that you know you know kind of running in large data centers that they can scale up easily using infrastructure like kubernetes uh and then they might build their web and mobile applications on top of those microservices and then those microservices might be getting their data uh through a database like uh cassandra and we're also starting to see the emergence of this idea of a data gateway which is uh brought to us by stargate that's something that we'll talk about toward the end of the workshop hopefully not see more much more than an hour from now or maybe less uh and then uh as a way of really um getting a lot of automation around application deployment and operations we've done a lot of deployment of microservices and even other applications using docker and other containers and then we needed something to manage all those containers so that's where we got kubernetes and then all the major cloud providers have a kubernetes environment hosted environment that they provide or you could do something like vmware tanzu or just kind of run it in your own self-hosted environment so you can do kubernetes everywhere in your own data center in the cloud or both with multi-cloud that kind of thing so this is sort of the landscape now one of the problems that we've seen is people using kubernetes for their application tier and using that to scale out uh and being very happy with a containerized application layer and then running a separate cassandra cluster outside of that and so a lot of people have been asking us how do i run my cassandra cluster in kubernetes alongside my application code so i can you know automate the deployment of all that stuff together as a unit and some people have definitely made some progress kind of working on their own but we as a community have really come to the conclusion that we're going to get farther a lot more quickly if we work together so that's when the cassandra community and others started working on uh various operators and the cast operator as a unified operator don't worry we'll talk about what that means and the kate sander project adds some glue on top of that operator that glues cassandra together with tools that make operating it more effective and easy and making it easy also to build your applications on top of it so we're trying to provide help provide an integrated package for everything here so that's some of the context for what we're doing and why so now we want to talk about cassandra so it's been you know around for over a decade now as probably uh the most scalable nosql database that is out there uh so we have a cassandra cluster and that would consist of multiple nodes and uh your your mileage may vary in terms of how much data uh and throughput you can get out of an each individual node based on your particular use case but there's some approximate benchmarks and including the very approximate benchmark of lots of transactions per second that we see here on the slide basically to scale up a cassandra cluster you just add more nodes that gives you more storage and that gives you more throughput uh in terms of the number of and the quantity and size of queries that your cluster can support whether it's reads writes a mix of both now these uh one of the awesome things about uh about cassandra is if these uh nodes are networked together if they can see each other then they communicate in the background using something called gossip to self-organize this allows the cluster to self-heal and also to route around a node that might not be performing very well for various reasons uh or even to route around if there's a network partition let's say and some of the nodes can't see each other cassandra has a lot of mechanisms built in that keep it very reliable for that so we have this concept of the nodes being organized in a ring this organization allows cassandra to scale linearly this is a chart that some of you may have seen before cassandra literally scales like this so there are technologies where you sort of get diminishing returns from adding uh additional nodes because the communication overhead for example within a cluster might start to bog down cassandra is a great technology in that it demonstrates a linear scalability so this is something that make that begins to make it very nice to pair alongside a scalable application architecture like if you have multiple multiple containerized microservices that you are scaling up and down the the number of service instances let's say in your kubernetes cluster so these begin to parallel each other in terms of their capability at the application tier at the database tier the way that cassandra works is that as you add nodes it distributes the data out it uses uh the way that you define your database schema in cassandra cassandra uses that to partition the data and to store it out to multiple nodes now this picture does show that distribution we'll see another picture in a second that shows how cassandra is distributing more actually multiple copies of your data for high availability and so it can survive the loss of a node without losing data so let's talk about how that replication works for just a second the fields that you identify in your database schema as being the partition key get hashed together and that data is used cassandra uses that data to figure out where to send uh which nodes should own your data so if you have a replication factor of three uh there will be a node that is the main owner of that range of hashed values and then the nodes that are adjacent to it will also uh in the ring basically uh so this is a conceptual organization each node is taking ownership of a portion of a hashed value we've represented on this slide as being a range of zero to a hundred but in fact the actual range is much larger but for illustration purposes we're saying uh using this using this smaller range so what happens uh when you insert a piece of data let's say that i'm inserting a row of data the partition key value hashes to the number 59 cassandra is great because i can route a write to any node in the cluster so when i do that let's say i send it to that orange node on the right that's marked with 17. uh through gossip the that orange node is aware that the three nodes that should own that data are the three nodes that are on the left there the the black node mark zero the light blue one marked 83 the purple one marked 67. those are the three nodes that should have a copy of that data um and so the orange node sends it there cassandra is also really resilient to failure and it has multiple mechanisms that are built in for keeping your data reliably so uh occasionally a node goes down uh could be a hardware failure could be that your cloud provider killed that virtual machine that it was running on could be a software error um could you know things happen in in large distributed systems right so that's uh that node has failed uh cassandra has multiple mechanisms that are built in for reliability if a node is down for a short time we can store a hint uh and then how when the node comes back online the orange node can send it the copy of the data and be very happy um however the hints are not kept forever and so there is a another mechanism a backstop that is called repair and we're going to come back to that theme in a little bit as one of the key operational things that kate sandra and a tool called reaper are going to help provide for you so i showed you a ring view of cassandra now i'm going to show you a second view which is called data centers and racks so we'll call this the topology view so in order to maintain high availability you're going to run your cassandra nodes and spread them across your infrastructure the terminology here is very sort of reminiscent of the days in which we were all running our own on-prem data centers so you see this data center and rack terminology um in the cloud world uh we might think of a data center as being equivalent to a cloud provider's region and a rack being equivalent to an availability zone and we're going to see mapping of this onto uh kubernetes workers in a little bit that are that are distributed throughout a kubernetes cluster so this terminology uh is is important for us to kind of understand the mapping right of how these ideas of cassandra data centers and racks map into the kubernetes world the other thing you'll notice here is that there's some intelligence in terms of uh organization of the different nodes uh and the assignment of those nodes onto the racks and this is generally done in such a way so that you actually have a copy of each piece of data within a rack so if i have uh if i have a replication factor of three i'm storing three copies of every piece of data cassandra is going to use its awareness of how the nodes are assigned to racks such that i have a copy of the data on so on a node in rack 1 and in rack 2 and in rack 3. so these are smarts that are built into cassandra itself we don't have to think about them as long as we configure our cluster correctly and that that caveat that if configured correctly is something that kate sandra is going to help provide for us so some more selling points of cassandra is that it is not limited to a single cloud region so you can have multi data center or multi-region deployments and again if you set your networking up correctly between clouds you can have hybrid and multi-cloud deployments of cassandra so not just aws or not just azure or not just google cloud but you can join any of those clouds up with nodes in your on-premises data center to get data replication to multiple locations so this makes cassandra a really great fit for flexible cloud deployments uh and we could talk about use cases for cassandra literally all day um because that's kind of what we do so uh but just a couple of the references i wish that we had a huawei slide in here alex we need to get that added uh yeah definitely definitely two of the earliest adopters are and massive users that are known are netflix and apple and you know these have been deployed cassandra in production for a decade or more interesting point what uh they all are not only using cassandra but they're also contributing heavily so both apple and netflix did such a great job again version 4. it's incredible instagram netflix apple they did a great job and to deliver many great updates um improvements features into the cassandra version 4. so that's really cool yeah i definitely i mean we we definitely spent a lot of time talking about great engineering work that was done not only at data sacs but companies throughout the industry um so i i hope that we uh we we definitely try to represent them well all right so switch gears to kubernetes i've given you a couple of teasers there about about cassandra so cassandra is basically a container orchestration tool so it's going to allow you to deploy containerized applications scale them up and down upgrade them keep them running replace things that fail um have high security around those so it's a it's a great environment for that and it's funny because uh in terms of running a database in a container um alex you probably know this but like when i did the first uh i didn't write the first edition of the cassandra book um because i was done in 2010 but then in about 2015 2016 when i was writing the second edition of the cassandra book um someone had suggested to me oh you should probably talk about docker and and running cassandra and i was like yes yes i will do that and um i'm going to recommend that you don't do it and that was about 2016. this is like if you want to be bleeding edge sure go ahead and try to run cassandra in a container but uh do that at your own risk and let us know how it goes so we can learn from it the world has completely changed since then so when i i did a third edition of the cassandra book last year and i had to at all um completely rewrite the docker section but oh by the way there was this whole new thing called kubernetes that i had to account for uh and so you know i mean that's it's great it's great to see the technology move forward in this area and we're going to talk a little bit about some of the things that um have been added into the kubernetes world over time to make it easier so we have this motion you know a lot of people have deployed cassandra on bare metal and then on virtual machines it's no problem right and then this motion toward deploying it on on a container where you have a very minimal a very thin kind of linux layer that's what most of us are going to be using in terms of a cassandra container that is just providing a little bit of networking and file system right data storage access i have to slow down so alex can add any any color that you want to sometimes worry if i want to add something i'm able to interrupt you i won't be able to stop you is that how it is yeah i like that uh that's a long strong joke so you just start a special workshop alex talking about cassandra in doker and the next stop is going to be approximately in 26 hours that's right we have we have a whole workshop for that as well i'll i'll say for that all right so some of the key differentiating features of kubernetes uh it allows the you know the deployment and scaling up of pods which are basically different containers that are running inside the context of these pods you can have pods that are kept up and running all the time or you can actually do kind of job style execution uh it does very efficient packaging of containers there's a scheduler built in to um into kubernetes that does a very nice allocation of containers based on the resources that they need uh we there is a detection uh of what nodes are up and down and what uh where we are running things as well as the containers that are running on them so there's a lot of self healing uh kinds of capabilities and then there's a lot of security features that are built in and there's a growing amount of support for being able to do storage and represent storage on kubernetes so that's that's really a key enabler for cassandra so just a quick introduce some of the parallel terminology i will try to be careful when using the word cluster because cassandra organizes its nodes and clusters and so does kubernetes and i guess sort of kafka does to you right i mean it's a common terminology for a distributed system to have uh you know multiple compute nodes where work is taking place and those to be organized in something called a cluster so uh in within a within a kubernetes cluster there is a machine that is the the master there's concept of a master which is running a bunch of control plane components and providing a rest api the that you can use to interact with the control plane and then there are worker machines or nodes where your containers are actually deployed and are running so if we are going to drill into what is inside the control plane there's this api server which i've mentioned so all the interactions with the control plane go through that api the containers that we are running inside pods they communicate through the api server and any uh tools that we're using cubecto uh you know that that we use at the command line that's going through the api server as well so that's kind of the sits in front of everything within that there is a controller manager so there it has a plugable architecture for adding different controllers there's some built-in controllers in kubernetes and then for the purposes of kate sandra we're going to see how there are some different uh uh managers that get plugged into that architecture uh and then there's also a scheduler that i've mentioned that distributes the work of different containers onto the nodes in your cluster and then etcd is used as a backing store for all of the information about what is deployed within your kubernetes cluster and then if we drill into what's happening on each individual worker node uh there is a little process known as the cubelet and that is in charge of running all of the kubernetes related things on the node it's in charge of talking to the container runtime whether it be docker or container d or something else that is running containers on that node and then there's a proxy that is provided provides networking services to basically to expose out network network access to each of the individual pods within within that worker node um a pod is generally most often runs a single container but it can run multiple containers uh within that deployment and so the pods are the things that are being monitored by uh by the things in that control plane in order to keep them running all right so um now that you understand everything about the architecture of kubernetes uh take you know let's see if you can deploy a cassandra cluster on kubernetes we'll give you the rest of this workshop approximately 90 minutes um you should be laughing at me and saying no that's that's probably not something that you're going to be able to cobble together in that amount of time um you're laughing alex yeah i mean i i like the idea to cover uh the wall kubernetes within 90 hours 90 not 90 minutes but 90 uh 90 hours that still would not be enough no but seriously like this is all you have to do right so we need to deploy a network uh we're gonna configure some kubernetes storage we're gonna install cassandra um on some individual nodes uh we we wanna be able to monitor them and grab metrics from them so let's see if we can get prometheus and grafana deployed we actually want to have agents on each of the nodes for the purposes of metrics of the cassandra nodes for the purposes of metrics reporting and then that's not even to mention any of the operational tasks that that we that we want to get set up so that we can have a well-maintained cluster um i haven't even talked about connecting an application to it i mean there's a ton of work here so obviously we're just kidding we're not going to manually do all of this uh we're going to use some helm charts package manager basically for kubernetes uh from the kit sander project to get all this deployed up and running yep i all i always say what best developers is lazy developers uh because we don't want to do it again and again so we better better automate everything that's what kate sandra and cass operator and other tools are doing they help you to be lazy and they help you to stay efficient it's done already so many times why would you do it manually again yes that's right that's right and and kubernetes is a declarative system we want to tell kubernetes the control plane what it is that we want what we would like our environment to look like and then let it do all the work of deploying all those things and wiring everything up so kubernetes is great and we need a little bit of help on top of that so that's why that's why the k-10r project exists and what we're going to be talking about next uh and you were like hey i know that a half an hour ago we said um you said show me the code alex we're getting so close hey yeah all right so think of kate sandra as a full working scalable database with admin tools and easy data access so making cassandra into a cloud native database so i'm gonna introduce the components a little bit at a time first we're gonna kind of look at this from a developer perspective and then a uh an operations kind of perspective yes you very well may be the person that cares about both so at the core we have cassandra you know scalable database there's a cast operator which will show you how that that works and what that provides on top of that we have the ability to layer stargate that's a data gateway provides rest graphql and document apis uh and then if you need to be accessing either the cassandra query language cql or any of those stargate apis outside of the cluster you may want to set up ingress so that so that those services are exposed outside of your kubernetes cluster so in case sandra we provided traffic as the default implementation of an ingress now thinking about operations we provided two projects that were originally developed by the last pickle and spotify and others called reaper and medusa so reaper is something that helps manages cassandra repairs and medusa is for managing backup and restore of cassandra's data files so we've integrated those two open source projects everything in keith sandra is obviously an open source project and then we've included prometheus for aggregating the metrics for the as part of the collection process of metrics and some uh grafana dashboards that we've built to help visualize uh the metrics about the health of your cassandra cluster so that's all packaged up together as part of cate sandra and then that that packaging basically how this is deployed is as a series of helm charts so it's a really composable plugable kind of architecture there's kind of like that parent kate sanders project that then pulls in other other charts like those that deploy the cast operator and reaper and medusa and so on and so forth so think of it think of accessing this in a couple different ways if you are a developer you're probably thinking more about the api side of things uh and your users are accessing your web and mobile applications which are built very often on top of microservices although you could have apps that do direct api access and that those are exposed again through that ingress and then you're accessing you know through the data gateway getting to cassandra for all the data access that your application needs on the operator side which you see on the right there they're using helm to deploy those charts into the kubernetes cluster and uh able to view metrics through grafana and to manage the operations of the cluster through interacting with uis that are provided by reaper and medusa and then medusa for cloud backup we have a plugable architecture for where you want to actually store your data files to object storage so this the most recent release of kate sanders the 1.0 release includes the s3 right and then we're working on others okay so setting up kate sandra is pretty easy we see the basic commands here on the upper left we're gonna uh and make sure that we have helm installed and obviously the kubernetes cluster where we're going to be deploying uh and then we'll add the the keith sandra home repo and the traffic helm repo if we're going to use traffic and then there's a simple helm install command which alex is actually going to demonstrate for you here in a second um referencing a uh cait sandra yaml file and there's an example of what that file might look like here provided to the right these urls on the lower left are the more full getting started guides there's a basic getting started guide that'll just help you install the charts and get it going and then there's there's a developer specific path that'll get you started on using stargate and a site engineer path that'll get you started on doing some of the operational tasks but you know what it's time yeah it's time it's time for some demo like uh sorry jeff uh i know you're a great guy but you are talking and talking with slides and slides and like where is the console let's get here so it's time so give me a moment to switch with things to my screen boom so uh i'm going to tell you a couple of things before we start with the demon again that's a veg must be a practice not only for me because well i know how to install kate sandra i'm not doing it for myself i'm doing it for you and to get the most benefits out of that you first watch and then the workshop is over you do it on your own if you have any problems you contact us at discord or well preferably in discord so what's important for you workshop idea that's the repo i guess it's been pasted already on the youtube many times let me do it again that's oh yeah i see thank you david so that's the repo and doing this workshop is a three simple steps so first one watch the workshop on youtube that's what you are doing right now thank you then do the practice steps and ask questions using our chat or our form now regarding the practice steps it's all described in our wiki so vikki of the project datastax devskatesandro workshop explains all the steps you have to do and to do the steps you have two options local setup or our cloud instance if you can do it locally great because you have no limitations you see these cloud instances pretty expensive and we give them uh where sponsored by data stock so we cannot give them for so many people um for a long time so we will be very limited on time usually 24 hours only and therefore if you prefer to keep it on your pace do it over the weekend you better do it on your machine if you have a proper machine so we suggest at least four cores and whoa eight gigabytes ram but frankly speaking you need more to have some of that better working so if you need provided cloud instance contact alex that's me in case of any questions so you can require one you can ask for one using this link or contacting me on discord or using my email address if you have this one but then this link is easiest one or you can go on with the local installation with the local installation what you have here is um yeah install missing software before before we start list is pretty obvious for the kubernetes tool first you are going to need docker no questions when you are going to need kind if you are following our exact steps kind is a kubernetes and docker local installation of kubernetes bad for your production but very good for uh testing learning purposes so things like that um then cube ctl kubernetes control command line tool pretty obvious you cannot manage kubernetes without cubesat here last guy is helm and helm is obviously a package manager we mentioned already then you will need this repository github.com datastacksdevs we have everything prepared for you and finally you will have to start this cluster with kind create blah blah blah blah blah cube's tail clustering for blah blah blah blah blah and then you will be good to go if you are using cloud instance situation is be different if you are using cloud instance you have to connect with cloud instance and everything is installed already so how to connect very easy there are uh two main options if you are using ssh connection if you have linux machine bash terminal and so on and so forth you can just use ssh command use user ese 2-user password data stocks and you are good if you have windows you may need putty or tools like that then if you cannot use ssh native connection you can use web based connection so we install it even shell in the box for you like well we did a lot of work actually so uh using the link you will get from me you will open the you will use it to open the first link ssh console in a browser and again using the credentials above and you will be good so it should be simple how to check if your instance is ready to proceed first one you just issue the command cube ctl get notes if you have a list like that so kind worker worker two worker free and think so on then uh it's all good you are ready and we can start finally and that's what i'm doing right now again uh don't run and don't try to ask all the questions right now with other companies or with other workshops you may need to ask all the questions during the live session but not with us because we stay available to you you can contact us at discord preferably so first step i'm going from wiki to step one and it's here or on the right side and i'm going to setting up cassandra cate sandra so i will move this screen a bit to a site so i can start with my terminal and i will make it a little bit bigger so you will be able to see that and you know what hey jeff i'm going to move us a little bit so i will not hide the code and you will not hide the code as well so now we are close neighbors but keeping social distance okay well that didn't hurt at all yeah so good so how do we install this thing situation is very easy as soon as we have kubernetes running and helm installed and those the prerequisites installation is going to be very simple my first step oops sorry wrong button yeah my first thing here is to add repository for helm helm is a kinda package manager well it's not exactly the package manager but the work principles are very similar to those we are doing we simply state a simple command helm repo add it will be called kate sandra and that's what we will use as the source repository https helm kate sandra dot io slash stable boom kate sandra has been added to your repositories kate sandra is not enough at least for our purposes we need to open some ports open some services and show you some things running internally so i will need one more thing which i'm going to install it's called traffic uh traffic is reverse proxy is an ingress controller in this case for kubernetes which makes possible for your queries from outside of kubernetes reach internal kubernetes services very easy traffic is a great tool it's pretty new so i doubt if most of you have heard about that uh but i can tell you it's much more convenient to use as an ingress controller than for example nginx and i'm a big fan actually of nginx so if i say traffic is interesting well when it matters something and that does answer i think one of the questions i saw in the chat earlier about how would you access the cassandra nodes from outside the cluster and that you know the using ingress like this is the answer to that yeah yeah so of course as any uh normal kubernetes system uh there are multiple ways you can reach the application i don't know node ports hope you don't do it on production but still it works um and other ways and we recommend to use uh investors and specifically traffic but you're gonna do it of course using another um ingress tools what you would prefer to use this workshop uses traffic and finally we added those repositories but it's not enough so we have to issue a command helm repo update and we see what some messages here successfully got an update from traffic chart repository successfully got an update from the k200 chart repository i hope it looks uh oops sorry i hope it looks good for you as well and we can proceed uh question is can we name anything or it's mandatory to use kate sandra so take a look nothing is mandatory you are an adult person with free will so uh feel free to name it whatever you would like to but for the clarity and for the simplification purpose i would suggest during a workshop follow the default follow the suggested names and if you brave enough to change something we will we may try to help you but well better follow the rules in this case okay so yeah next thing we are going to do is we are going to help install traffic uh viv so we updated the repository and now we are going to install traffic um that's going to be pretty quick and now i can say watch cube ctl get port and we see what only one um port is being started it's going to be ready very quickly so usually it takes some seconds and while okay it's ready and while it's being um opened let's take a look what the file was so what's the file we are using for this one oh oops sorry all files are present in the repository obviously and this case we're using traffic.yaml file that's a configuration for traffic which helps traffic uh to run the things that's as it's a kind of router it's all about which ports to open which words to listen for which service very simple we are opening pretty a lot of ports and in this case as it's learning uh environment we are using node ports again but with ingress service so it's much easier to use and we are opening some ports for the cassandra so for example cassandra port 1942 cassandra secure for tls secured connections some secret things we will talk a bit later so stargate special guest and of course web interface and traffic dashboard so uh with that decided let's take a look how it looks and i'm going to open the ingress traffic dashboard and the link is very simple that's going to be the your link if you're using cloud instance i will send them to you or it will be port 9000 by default using our settings and then you have to put dashboard one very often uh happening mistake if you just skip the path traffic says you page not found so don't forget to put the page it's just dashboard and then you oops dashboard with slash in the end that's important and then you get traffic dashboard and there are already pretty a lot of things running so traffic consists of entry points rotors services middlewares traffic works with http tcp and odp today we will talk mostly about http so routers are the ideas uh the set of rules those will root your request to a proper tools proper services it's the default installation of traffic nothing is running except of traffic and therefore we have only two uh services only two routers for dashboard that's we are where we are and uh second one uh is just ping which is out of scope for today and there are some internal grafana oh sorry grafana internal traffic services again mostly dashboard what's interesting for us for today so with traffic running so i see there are some questions we have to answer are there any questions we have to answer now nope okay it looks like we are good to go so this is a question about port conflict ah these ports with other well-known ports on kubernetes deployment do you see that uh those so uh someone is trying to do the exercises already um that's let's keep it for later let's move on so traffic is running but well traffic is not enough it's only the ingress and we want to have something behind ingress we need kate sandra so it's time comes to for us to run kate sandra it's going to be very close to the things we did before it's going to be very simple helm install kate sandra from repository it's under cassandra i ask helm to install kate sander for me and as a configuration file i will use case android yaml we will take a look at this file in a moment first let's start settings first let's start to set up things and after some seconds usually it takes not so long time we get the notification what it's being deployed or deployed from the helm point of view oh yeah here we go 4k sandra so for traffic and 4k sandra it's revision one stat was deployed okay so let's take a look what's going on the core of kate sandra is cass operator so gas operator is the application kubernetes application which helps with all the routine operations on your cassandra or kate sandra cluster for example you want to change a setting on all of your nodes you can do it manually you can go to the first node change the setting restart it to apply the setting if exchange remodel requires that restart and then you have to go to the second one to the third one and so on with cass operator you change the settings for the cluster and cass operator will not just restart the world cluster but it will apply the rolling update for all of the nodes one by one so you will always have your consistency level reachable which is great so this stateful set is kit sandra by itself so it's a cassandra and cassandra management api running together it's not yet ready because it takes time to start up for them then about stargate we will speak in a moment grafana and prometheus are monitoring tools we will use in the next step and uh reaper operation we reprocurator we need for repairs as mentioned already and prometheus cassandra cube kidzano cube prometheus is to manage obviously primophiles and graffana stack and traffic well you've seen that already as the thing goes on let's take a look at the file we are working with so uh what's the file and how it looks and why should we care uh kate sandra file in the repository is the very important file which describes the wall cluster setup first of all and the most important part for us is the settings for cassandra which version we are going to use which storage class we will use because well we are working with stateful sets and that's very important to have proper storage class persistent volume claims and so on which size it will have some heap and java settings resources allocation and finally what the amount the of the cassandra servers we are going to have so we will have only one data center data center one only one rack name it default and one machine in this rack one cassandra node in this rack well stargate i will skip it for a second reaper as well we will get back to them don't worry i'm not skipping them at all i'm going to back to one soon and there are downstairs monitoring settings so uh the most commonly used monitoring toolset to watch uh to control cassandra is prometheus and grafana primitives to get the time series data metrics from cassandra and grafana is to visualize them have nice dashboards alerting and so on there is a question why do we use primary fuse to store metrics from from cassandra idea is very simple if we store cassandra matrix in cassandra and cassandra have problems or down for whatever reason you will be not able to get in even metrics so the golden rule store your metrics in another place not on the place you are monitoring very easy so i hope it's already fine and i'm perfectly right so uh cassandra is running here we go both both containers in the pot one for cassandra and one for management api there are some things meanwhile happening uh reaper has been deployed over our cassandra cluster so we have reaper shaman distribution completed reaper operator running and reaper for cassandra running and stargate is starts it takes some time so we will discuss that some moments later so we are ready to move on our next step would be we have to verify it doesn't actually start stargate until uh the cassandra nodes are up just by the way yeah yeah it makes no sense yeah uh we cover that a little bit later so and finally we want to do some things we want to take a look what's going on um by itself kubernetes operates with pretty primitive ideas deployments replica sets ports services it's all great those are very very important bricks we use to build the system but complex systems complex distributed systems like cassandra they are powerful but of course not simple to manage require a lot of attention require a lot of things to avoid you doing all the things and to help you avoid doing all the things manually there is a great thing called customer resource definition in casa in kubernetes with custom resource definition you can describe what you want the one single definition and it's very much easier to try to keep in the air like dozens of the more simple concepts so what's cass operator part of case sandra introduces is cassandra data center cassandra data center is a custom resource definition beef description of the cassandra data center very easy and cube ctl get cassandra data centers shows me what we have one it's active for six minutes and we can for example say cubesat describe and boom there is always dozens lines of the information because well there's pretty a lot of work done and a lot of things included but what's important for us it works there is a cassandra data center and it uses helm chart kitsandro100 and that's actually great because we already have a lot of things running and that was the installation and in the next part we proceed with monitoring but i guess jeff it's your turn now wow already hey yeah okay well i i can't hear you i can't keep speaking i can't skip keep speaking i'm just trying to give you a hard time because you were talking about how long i talked i'm just it's how i get you well you know working yeah working with kubernetes is always hard time but you kind of enjoy it so i'm switching to your screen then okay great great boom okay so i wanted to tell you a little bit of detail i'm not going to explain all of the objects and all the pictures on these next couple slides to you but i wanted to help maybe tie together some of the terminology so uh in kubernetes there is a construct known as name spaces that you is a very useful tool to scope things so the name that you picked for your kate sander cluster we defaulted it to kate sandra for the for the purposes of the demo that alex was running so all of the infrastructure that is sparked by kate sandra is uh it's all placed into a kate sandra namespace so that allows us to actually isolate that set of components down and look at them all together at the same time okay life happens my guy at the door i think has been dispatched so um uh also in kubernetes world i mentioned earlier that we have uh how there is um increased maturity in the kubernetes world for how we're managing storage so we have this concept of a persistent volume where you can actually configure uh a block of storage somewhere that you're making accessible to your kubernetes cluster that's a persistent volume and then you can have applications such as cassandra that are making persistent volume claims saying i need access to a certain amount of a certain amount of storage that i want to be able to make use of to put my files on and so then kubernetes provides the mechanisms for linking together those persistent volumes and matching them up with the persistent volume claims and then basically you can have this concept of a storage class which describes different uh types of storage so you don't different applications have different forms of storage needs and so you have different storage classes for those so part of configuring if you just want to part of what the instructions show for getting started is if you're going to run kubernetes on basically like a desktop distribution there will sometimes be a little bit of a step that you need in order to have a storage class made available on your your desktop machine so i don't think that was something that we dwelled on very much in the instructions but you you may run into that a little bit later if you're trying to do this on your own okay so uh stateful set is a group of can a group of pods basically uh that are configured so that they actually have some storage needs they're using these percent persistent volume claims um so that uh this is done in such a way that uh if we actually have to kill a pod and restart it we can actually make a replacement pod that connects to the same storage that was pre used by a previous pod this is a great thing that we want to be able to do in a cassandra cluster so if you're if you want if you have a case where a cassandra node goes down and we want to replace that node we want to actually be able to point it to the same storage volume where the previous data files were stored and using these stateful sets allows us to do that within kubernetes kubernetes also allows us to extend it so we can define our own resources on top of the basic uh resource types that are provided by kubernetes itself so what i'm showing you on the upper right here is the idea of a resource a custom resource that is known as a cassandra data center so this is actually defined as part of the cast operator project i can have a cassandra data center resource that we can operate on so cass operator is a kubernetes operator that operates on cassandra data centers uh we also use this concept elsewhere in the cait sandra world so the cassandra medusa project that manages backup and restore there is actually such a thing as a cassandra backup resource and a cassandra restore resource and so on and then the the other main piece that we've mentioned a couple times is that is this idea of an operator now an operator in the kubernetes world is something that's considered to be part of the control plane of kubernetes you can define operators that operate on your custom resources so the cast operator is an operator that operates on these cassandra data centers and the other instances of this in the architecture is reaper has an operator for example prometheus has an operator so this is where you actually in in a kubernetes deployment you create these operators these have the smarts about the particular things about operating uh your specific infrastructure so we could very easily just uh deploy cassandra nodes to uh to kubernetes worker nodes using the basic kubernetes apis but we actually want to have some smarts because we want to deploy cassandra nodes to specific locations or to specific worker nodes so that there's a good distribution of data we want to control the startup order if we if we just start a bunch of cassandra nodes at the same time without care they might get confused so we want to bring them up in an orderly fashion so that they can initialize their startup and then add another node and let it initialize and then add another node so all of those smarts about how to do those things are embodied in this operator uh and then when we deploy cassandra uh each cassandra node becomes is deployed in a pod now pods allow us to run multiple containers but you can also have multiple processes within a container so both of those deployment options are available uh within a pod that's running a cassandra node we are deploying alongside this management api for apache cassandra so this is another open source project that that data stacks has started uh what this management api does um what does a number of things but most importantly for kate sandra it provides http restful access to metrics off of a cassandra node so we actually uh and this is preferable to the normal way that you historically get metrics from cassandra nodes which was java management extensions jmx notoriously difficult to kind of understand and use so we're basically every time we run a cassandra node with cass operator and in cate sandra we're deploying alongside it this little process which provides http access to the metrics that's a part of the architecture all right so uh we had a little bit of a joke a while ago about like if you were going to wire up all these pieces together uh on your own um it would definitely take you a really really long time um so and all we mentioned in that slide was basically just like normal kubernetes uh deployment kinds of things just like setting up uh pods and networking for them uh the cast operator is actually doing one level better than even all of the things that we mentioned it has the smarts about all the things that you need to do to have uh a best practices for running a cassandra cluster so it only bootstraps one node at a time so that there's no confusion it manages cassandra's seed nodes which is how new nodes bootstrap themselves into a cassandra cluster if you need to do a upgrade let's say you want to go from cassandra 3.11 to the upcoming cassandra 4.0 the operator has the capability to do that to do the rolling restarts that are required to do those kind of upgrades um it also helps you to manage scaling up racks evenly so that you have an equal number of nodes uh on the uh basically assigning uh assigning new cassandra nodes evenly across the different worker nodes in your kubernetes cluster so all these things are the smarts that you would really need uh not just to get a cassandra deployed but to keep it operational and running so that these are the things that the cast operator is giving you um so i'm gonna get allow myself one more architecte type slide i love the architecture slides as an architect near and dear to my heart but this kind of gives you a concept of what this deployment might look like across a kubernetes cluster where we're mapping these um you see the the purple idea the the little pink boxes are the uh cassandra concepts of the rack so we have nodes that are allocated across these conceptual racks running on different worker nodes within the cluster and a question here should i as a user care and should i manually manage allocation of the nodes over the racks and worker nodes of kubernetes no this is what the what kit sandra and the cass operator are doing for you so you don't have to think about this part well um you just well you can't think about it yeah yeah but yeah there is indeed a lot of being stake in care by kate sandra so i mentioned a little bit about how the monitoring works let's actually get a demo of how all that gets set up yeah so uh you have a couple of slides first i see uh well these are uh these are the sort of slides that you have uh as a backup in case the demo breaks i'm sorry if i'm revealing too many secrets here but i think your demo is gonna work so why don't we just go and give you give us the live uh could you please switch to the previous slide for a second where is the pink what worth mentioning it's uh oh yeah absolutely one slide back yeah exactly so as it's stated above monitoring is done with metric collector for apache cassandra if you are the lucky one responsible for metrics and monitoring for cassandra cluster doesn't matter if you use kate sandra car separator or do you use kubernetes at all or you prefer bare metal old school perfectly fine metric collector for apache cassandra allows very important events natively to get the monitoring metrics the most important well actually dozens and hundreds of them i would say putting into them things all together at your disposal and you don't have to try to extract them manually via gmix or no tool or whatever it's already done open source open source it by data stocks so just jump into the project give your stars make your pull requests and we will be happy to have some support as it's the community project open source project now i'm switching to myself and yeah good so there is a pink dimension now we have to take care of the monitoring and that's a step two so monitoring is a big thing uh and we prepare it that's this topic is not a monitoring explaining monitoring the cassandra would take some dozens of hours but we want to help you to start doing this properly using tools what we prepare it for you so we use grafana and prometheus to monitor cassandra to monitor your system with ease and how do we do that idea is very simple in the traffic by the way you see how many more services and routers now we have 10 routers 10 services that's because everything has started already and here in the services we can find important things for example grafana and for example prometheus so great let's first take a look at the prometheus the idea is very simple if you worked with it no questions if you didn't work again don't worry we have a link for that it's going to be on port 8080 if you are following our steps with them workshop setup and the path will be prometheus yeah so primitives is here it's working it can uh you can choose the metrics you want to see you just can insert metrics uh from a list and as said thanks to metrics collector for apache cassandra by data stacks there are a lot of them but and we can execute that and get some data if you prefer to have some graphs you can switch to graph and again have some data right here but you know what prometheus is great and thanks uh for this incredible project but we have something better for data visualization so let's switch to graphana how do we switch to grafana i'm using my url for this workshop i'm using port 8080 there are links explaining that in the wiki so don't make your screenshots don't try to write it down right now you will be good and there is sub path called grafana i'm being redirected to login in your case it's admin admin in my case it's a little bit different because i've changed the password and we already have now if you have experience with grafana you should be like okay now we have to set up data source now we have to set up dashboards panels 1000s of different metrics it's not easy even to set up a monitoring if grafana is running already but you know what again god bless automation it works already let me show you i'm switching to my existing dashboards and i already have four dashboards here cassandra cluster condensed cassandra overview stargate and system and node metrics so we can for example open cassandra cluster condensed and see the metrics for all together like well in the condensed way so nothing extra just some nice ideas and here you can manage already eat with prepared variables so you can group by cluster or data center or a rock it makes no sense currently because well it's single cluster single rack single uh server but for your production lady ready it may be very positive you can grab multiple clusters or one single particular one again in my case it doesn't make a big difference because i have only one you may operate with multiple data centers multiple racks filter data using different tracks and key spaces and so on and so forth and here you see the request server in the cluster latencies so all the most important things we can switch back to the dashboards and open cassandra overview so here we are going to have a little bit more information with different pending compactions cassandra cluster data size how much data you have i don't have so much as a stable counts and all the things important for you to manage the cassandra it's all already it's all prepared and it works and we see the node status what i have my node up and running and that's great and it's already completely ready to use so you see data is being updated cool so in my monitoring settings we have many screenshots in case what everything goes if anything goes wrong but i like the live demos that's a little bit higher risk but you get information directly and like look how it happens in a real life so we have a lot of different things here and if you are into monitoring now you may be happy because so many things prepared for you and if you are not into monitoring and interested about that well you know where to start prometheus grafana kate sandra and if you are not into that you must be bored already so jeff i think we are good to switch to the next step okay well let's swap back over to my slides here and uh yep you are good next up we are going to talk about working with data have this cassandra cluster running how do i get at it and run some queries against it so oh okay funny enough i don't have any pictures for you because i want i i want to see the the access let's do it let's get me back to my command prompt uh well take a look there are uh two main ways to work with data work from application and usually we use sql format or work from console command line using sequel sage and we will take a look at the both so actually it was pretty quick one and i'm switching back to my screen good yeah sorry i accidentally advanced the slide there so working with data today we are going to use the both ways we are going to deploy an application see it running see how it works with the data in cassandra but also we are going to jump in to the cassandra note and execute sql sh statements manually so we will follow the both ways so first thing to mention we have a pet clinic app pet clinic is a pet clinic comes from a java world and it's about it's a demo application for multiple technologies you may have different libraries implementation and so on in our case it's um i believe that's mostly delivered by cedric london uh our colleague if you work with uh per clinique application spring pet clinic reactive uh say hello to cedric he's in the chat and idea of this application for us as we are today is like let's imagine we are today more of operation guys it's very simple it has a front-end single page application javascript and it has back-end java and we will happen we will make it working together with ease very very easy again we prepared this petclinic.yaml file which you may just reuse for our practice steps so let me clear it up and i'm putting cube ctl apply dash f patch clinic yaml if you are already into the kubernetes you know what's going on and if you are not give me five seconds to explain you can give to kubernetes direct commands run these or run that delete that set it up like this but that's it works but that may be not the best way a normal way you describe what you want to have in the yaml files and then you just apply them and that's exactly what we are doing right now i'm applying these file and i have my deployment for pet cleaning back and created service for pet clinic backend created i need service because so frontend will be able to communicate with backend i have deployment but clinic front and created for the front end i have service but clinic front and created so a service specific front that will be available using ingress so traffic in our case and ingress for that is being created as well we can take a look at this file and uh well that's a typical kubernetes file which uh set all the required things up so we describe the deployments we are going to have we describe the services we are going to have and so on and so forth good so let's take a look at the uh ports i'm going for watch your city get pots and we have our uh services here running our pods here running for pet cleaning back-end airplane pet clinic front-end we hope we deployed them already let's take a look how it works the idea here is very very simple oops yep so by the way notice in the monitoring request for outputs are changing that's because we are putting some things we are running some queries and we have here pet clinic demo up uh that's going to be your url port 8018 and let's give it a moment to start up there is angular if you're familiar with front-end you must know that this technology already or at least have heard something about that that's a bad clinic application based on uh spring and angular for front end it features some owners veterinarians pets uh doing some things and you see this it looks like the base was profiled for me already but i can add a new pad what would be a patch type i want to add let's say okay i know the world needs a pet type alex i was gonna say emu too late but okay i can add one more how do you write it in english e-m-u like this okay um okay so i'm going to australia okay i doubt if it's a good pet well i'm never sure in alex but let's keep going and we can switch to the owners we can take a look at the existing owners there are no one and we can register a new owner i don't know whatever let it be jeff whatever it be carpenter carpenter i have no idea about the address but let it be like that and city okay let it be i will make you my neighbor you will you're going to leave an otterberg now and well phone number is not important and i'm adding owner we have one and as we have owner we can add a new pad it's obviously going to be ammon how do you will how will you call your ammo uh jeff fred okay now we have jeff owning uh ammo named fred and let's say it's a very very very young one so just from november of year 2020 poor bird okay so uh now the question is alex why do you show us all those veterinarians and pet types and ammos answer is very simple how to set up your application working with kate sandra cassandra running in case sandra answer is very easy uh basically uh there is a normal kubernetes way to do the things secrets and that's it and they're just to using secrets so my application has access to the database which has username and password and it works seamlessly and i don't have to do anything it just works uh so the only thing you have to do is to rework oops is to reuse the secret keeping the username and password but what happens then if you don't want uh if you want to connect manually and you need information about how do you do that what's the answer answer is very simple if you don't want to use pet clinic and you need something different there are other ways to set up things you want to know the password so do i so let's take a look at the step 3 of working with data step 3 says what we need to switch to console i will clear it once again and first cascade sandra stores as a good polite application stores everything in cuba city secrets so uh sorry kubernetes cigarettes cube ctl offers a lot of secrets some of them by help some of them by traffic and so on and so forth what's interesting for us now is cuba city get secret it's named kate sandra super user uh oop super you zero boom yeah you see it's a real live demo uh so we have the secret and now we are going to retrieve some data from it so i can execute a command like that uh cube city l get secret case under super user output view json path data user names because well i need the username here but it's going to be okay i'm hiding the inform but it's going to be something like that why because those are in base64 encoded so full command to expose the username will look like that and we surprisingly find out what the username of case android superuser is okay it's android super user uh could have been easier uh but we need only not username but also password so this time i will go a shorter way cube ctl getsecret which secret okay it's under super user which part of the secret i'm going to retrieve data password and i'm going to decode it from base64 and print and that's my password that's a password from my cassandra very good now question what can we do with this tool now we know a password by the way uh we will use it in the future tasks as well but what we are going to do with this password we can use cubectl and securelssh to jump in and start using things so oops i am going to connect and let's take a look at this command you are going to execute it if you are doing the steps cube ctl exec will execute the command i will need an interactive terminal uh that port i'm going to apply this exact to okay it's android datacenter one default stateful set 0. so this stateful set 0 is the main cassandra port i'm using i'm working with right now in this port i will need to communicate with container cassandra because one container may have more than may have more than one one port may have more than one container sorry and then finally my command will be cqlsh cassandra super user and the password is the one i've extracted recently so i'm putting it right here and boom okay i have a little warning i will ignore for now but the point is i'm now on the secular sh terminal for cassandra and i can start using that very easy like for example uh describe um key spaces okay spaces and we have some key spaces some system key spaces reaper key spaces and spring but clinic case spaces okay i can say use spring pet clinic done now i can show describe tables we have some tables and finally i can do some bad things and say like select all don't do it on your production for example for pet clinic select oh from sorry from pet clinic at by owner hey there is the threat mo of jeff and it's here so our application works with cassandra our console works with cassandra and that's kinda great so hey jeff fred is i'm just celebrating fred is pretty yeah fred is persistent fred is here fred is real um uh hope uh he will like uh living with you and i guess we are proceeding to the next step yeah you know why don't you just keep going we don't have to switch screen back i think uh like our next step is scaling our cassandra cluster up or or down as the case may be so why don't you keep rolling yeah i think it's really makes sense so i will switch to the next step then okay and our next step is going to be step four scaling up and down that's a very important thing to be able to scale your database up and scale your database out scale your database down the thing i want to do first is i want to take a look at the manifest helm manifest of k-sun run and if i execute this command it will look approximately like that uh and still listing that's because kubernetes people working with kubernetes aren't software developers or sre engineers they are yaml programmers basically they describe all they do with yaml kubernetes is the ocean of yaml and that may be too much for us so let's focus more on the things we want to have and what i want to have is i want to understand the current size of my cluster of course i can watch it in grafana but we can do something easier here i'm going to run the same command but i'm going to grab size current size going to be well there are a lot of size things related but the size what's interesting to me is oh okay i guess i'm hiding the values again oh my god okay let me hide here on top good so the size what matters to me now is this size one that's exactly the size of a cassandra cluster with the car separator we are having here and my next thing will be i want to change this side now how do i change this site again in theory you can try to give the direct commands to uh kubernetes to help kate sandra but it's not the best way the best way is to keep your infrastructure as a code and describe your infrastructure describe what you want to have in your files and then apply those files then just attach git and boom you have history of all the changes you are doing in the git despite your changing infrastructure that's incredible improvement that's the best way it's an incredible improvement it saved my ass in some situations for last uh five years i'm actively using infrastructure as a code but anyway what the thing we are going to do is we are going to change um gates and run and that's the cassandra definitions here what's important for me and important thing to me is the date center size so in this case i'm getting down here switching to a size and i'm going to raise it to 2. in the documentation you may meet them suggestion to raise it to free notes and it's great suggestion but uh last time i did it my training note was very busy afterwards because free cassandra's running on a single machine it's a cassandra in it's a kubernetes in docker installation so it's a big machine but it's already running it's a macbook pro right that's not a macbook pro i'm just playing aws t2 extra large oh i see yeah yeah so it's uh maybe not enough for free if you uh like expect what three maybe too much then stick to two and i'm saving my changes and all the things i have to do afterwards is simply oops keep still sorry because we are using helm manifest here upgrade because well i'm upgrading what i'm going to upgrade i'm going to upgrade my deployment which type of deployment is going to be kate sandra unrun you don't have to type it on your own you have it uh describe it and you can copy paste it from them wikim and which file i'm going to apply is the main one that's going to bk sandra dot yaml helm upgrade kits and rock it's under kit sandra it's android kits android kit sandra good um so applying those changes may take some time but now we see what your revision 2 is done and uh it may take some time to deploy so let's take a look at the watch upctl get bots so we have one stateful set successfully running for half an hour already and we have second statement set in the port initializing state it may take some time obviously soon we will see those changes in the grafana as well so again it's fully automated we don't have to add it to a monitoring because together with grafana operator with labels and so on so there's a lot of work behind that but we have everything monitored as well and the thing we can do right now is to check manifest for cassandra for kids under again and this time we will have size two as i set it as a desired uh size yeah there you go second note we'll have um we'll use first note as a seed to join the cluster automatically and they will work together in a single cluster again i don't have to do it manually because it's done for me and now jeff uh do you have an idea how do we scale cluster down i would guess that you do the same thing except in reverse exactly change the number now i will simply put the number in the file and apply this file again as everything is described i don't have to change anything it's already working for me and i guess i'm going to have my node status here very soon not yet updated but going to be there in a moment ah but okay my note was not running so obviously i don't have it here right now now it starts up and my note is about to start good so uh saving some of our time yeah i'm getting back to my uh file case android yaml i'm switching to my data center dc1 and switching size to one again and now i'm going to apply those changes in the way i did it before so it's always upgrade that's uh that's a funny bit but if you think it's very similar idea in cassandra there are actually technically in the end two kind of statements select or absurd uh with uh with the nature of cassandra it's going to be insert as an update or update as an insert pair depending on the primary key and uh basically here is the same we always upgrade we're adding something we're removing something but it's always upgrade for the system and now we have a revision free so we can uh that's right say helm get manifest cassandra okay it's unrun we will have again size 1 and obviously we can watch our notes pods and first stateful set still successfully running and second stage will set as being terminated very well so that's how you scale up and scale down and i'm going to proceed to a step five what is step five five is a stargate i am not sure if i'm ready to show it that's something you know what uh maybe we should keep it secret okay okay okay jeff i guess now it's your turn to show a couple of slides okay do we have four stars uh for for the stargate you have something to share so yes i'm switching off uh that's your turn now and let us know what's with stargate it's something new for even the most experienced cassandra users yes that's right so one of the classic uh problems or tensions that that we have seen is uh developers uh don't always want to learn a new query language they don't necessarily want to have to think about what the schema looks like and we know that data modeling and cassandra and the design of your schema is very important it has been because it really affects your performance so operators are neces are not necessarily interested in doing spending a lot of time on query optimization or working with application developers to optimize things and so what we've seen a number of companies do is actually create their own api layers that abstract access to cassandra and after talking with a number of those uh we had started a new project uh called stargate that uh it basically provides um a plugable architecture for adding new apis on top of cassandra so we don't have to have this world where uh developers and uh dbas or sres are kind of have it out for each other we want to be able to provide this api layer so the way stargate works is that you can plug any version of cassandra in on the back end so you know including um open source cassandra datasax versions of cassandra uh stargate is actually integrated into astra our database as a service and now you can run it as part of your kubernetes cluster as part of the kate sander project so you see currently stargate has it provides for you know for a cassandra database it'll provide a rest api or a graphql api or a json style document api or or even straight uh cql access and then we're working on some other things like this is a very plugable architecture so we're working on some other extensions to that um so why don't you take it back and give us a quick stargate demo and then i'll pull things back and wrap it up i think yep give me a second so let me switch to my place yep good and yep so stargate is about apis and to use the power of those different apis you can use cassandra not directly with cqsh and data modeling for cqlsh for sql and so on and so forth to use the apis like rest graph and so on uh there are some things we have to do first we have to prepare and what first thing we have to do it's a step five in the beginning is we have to create the token access token for ourselves and we do it with a simple cool request to the api in our case it's going to be like that so of course first of all we have to copy it we have to put the password and password you remember we prepared it recently and our password was [Music] this one so and second variable i have to change here is the address i'm going to use so again if you are using your own node it's going to be your own address and if you are using the training note it's going to be something like that and by the way something is wrong with my note it's pretty interesting i i will check it in a moment yeah i see that note is down so anyway let me live demo yeah that's a live demo that's how it works okay very clear can it achieve consistency level one so what's going on with my ubc get puts it looks like my stateful set is not ready yet the note is being restarted so i guess it will take some time for it to start let me check so cube cdl if it would be running but not answering i would check logs but if i cannot check logs i have to use describe to get the idea of what's going on describe port this board okay i think actually it's readiness probe failure i think it's just starting so hopefully it will be fine after a moment i want to believe okay this one is being terminated looks like scaling quite not successful to me maybe that's um resources issue we have because well three nodes were bad idea on the same machine yeah i think it's working as designed yeah very possible so i think do you do you want me to do the uh the wrap-up slides and then we can come back and see if it really makes sense maybe you have uh do you have a local deployment of a stargate or we can switch to wrap-up first indeed oh do i yeah oh you know okay yeah uh no okay i guess you don't okay so let's switch the way yeah i don't think i did it since my last reboot sorry no no no no no no of course okay that's a little hype like how live demo works now then i'm switching to your slides give me a second yeah you are live and i will try to recover it so we can proceed okay sounds good um so i think what we'll do is in the interest of time and allowing you to go through exercises on your own i think the running repairs is the piece that we will of the labs that let you to do on your own you'll get some experience of using the cassandra reaper to schedule some repairs on the cluster [Music] and um then backup and restore is uh another piece is that still in the exercises were that was a piece it's not in the exercises yet uh because it's being developed now uh and deliver it in the next version i believe uh the better out yeah people from kid sandra team because i know what it's very very very close and hopefully next time we do this workshop it will include the baking up and recovers well we are anyway out of time we are on the cutting edge here with some of this stuff this is just in time uh development of the kate sander project and just in time uh development of uh of these workshops so we're definitely like we're getting these capabilities out to you as quickly as we can um so just to give you the link again that we showed you before um this is all the exercises that we've been going through today are on the data stacks devs github under this kate sander workshop and then if you go to the wiki that's the best experience for for going through all the exercises and um hey they reach out to you alex for the uh the badging yeah uh so um okay uh two points very quickly uh i've got my uh stateful set working back finally so yes it was a successful restart uh and uh what i'm going to do two things first of all i'm switching back to my screen and yeah we have it running back uh then next thing how to work with stargate very quickly i will not show it because uh we have already no time but uh to explain quickly first you need to get token it's very easy you just execute this command you are replacing two statements your address with your address and password with your password every password is unique as i have prepared everything already i can simply repeat this command [Music] okay they are cke i still cannot contact this one but okay that's what you do and you get output like that of token access token and then you will need this access token to access data apis um and there are free data apis graphql rest api and um what was the third one data document api like share ls one um we cannot show all of them but because well it takes some time what matters here is stargate.io uh it's a very good place to start if you want to use those apis and take a look on how it works easiest way to work with where is my postman easiest way to work the rest and document api is to use postman because well cool is great but uh not the most simple one to use and you have a lot of things to fix the postman as data stacks prepare with the collections um you can simply reuse everything what we created so in my case i've imported two collections already stargate document api and stargate rest api and i can use them defining variables so if you switch to the beginning and you oh yeah good you have oh i let me make it bit bigger okay postman doesn't give me make it bigger i'm sorry a zoom a bit more okay doesn't work sorry uh but what matters in the uh core of the collection you can set up variables there are two variables you have to set up base url and authentication token those variables will be reused on the left side you have the list of the ways you can do using document api and the same for rest api and you can execute the execute those statement and they will be used automatically in the headers so base url url is used in the path and auf token is used in the its cassandra token header which you use to attach the token in my case it obviously will not work i have to update the token but that's not the point for the graphql when working with these um [Music] oops graphic yeah in the list of http routers you may find one called playground it's a playground you may use to work with graphql if you are into graphql it may help you a lot so i'm simply getting the same link i'm using for everything putting it here and switching from port 9000 to port oh my god was it 8 000 correct yeah it's describe it in the documents anyway 8018 8018 8018 and last step will be playground this one helps me to work with graphql playground and therefore use all the graphql schema and normal graphql ikea operations good and last point what we have to mention like okay everything in one minute is repair if we go to repair and should be enough nope not found okay web ui correctly links are in this weekend i'm trying to do everything with my own it's a great tool it's cassandra reaper which helps you to automate repairs so uh in my case it will not work because it looks like i cannot connect to my notepad but this one is running by the way interesting ah good and uh here i can schedule repair and make it apply it immediately or apply it on the shadow using the cluster i have i can specify or i have to specify the key space i'm going to use for example spring pet clinic key space for my application who is the owner okay alex when it has to be executed interval in days i want to run it weekly i'm adding the schedule and the repair will be executed automatically by cassandra reaper by the way um jeff do you remember who developed this reaper originally it was originally originally yeah originally originally it was some familiar names and familiar company oh yeah okay i don't remember yeah i mean like last pickle vlogs yeah so thank uh thanks slam so much for making this happen i'm running this repair and it should come here and it happens in the running repairs so for five tables we can view segments uh they are not started yet they are on the schedule it and we have to proceed to the next steps so anyway you are going to do it on your own before uh and see some things we are going to do so let's switch to a slide stand because we have to mention a couple of more things yes we do so one of the things that that i want to emphasize is you know this is a project with lots of active development happening we just uh released the 1.0 release of kate sandra last week um if you want to be up to date on everything that's happening a really good thing to do is follow on twitter right now uh we obviously the core project is on github at kate sandra and then kate sandra io there's a lot going on there um i've been the documentation team is cranking out step-by-step tutorials we just launched a blog last week we'd love to get some articles from people in the community that are using it uh using kate sandra uh we're working on adding forums to the website so that'll be coming pretty soon and one of the things that's really cool is if you go to the documentation part of the website you can actually click on a you can read a page and as you're working through the instructions on a page about how to do something you find a bug or an error you just click on edit this page and that puts you right into github to do a quick you can do a quick correction and submit a pr so you can do a correction or a comment submit a pr and then your your instantaneously helping uh with the with the project documentation which is pretty fantastic yep we're also working on uh a certification for uh you know we understand that there's a lot of people that uh maybe have history as a dba you know like running databases and they want to upskill and up level to you know becoming an sre that is instead of just managing the health of a single database you want to manage the health of an entire application full stack top to bottom and so this certification is based on running cassandra and kubernetes connecting it with your application all a lot of the things that we've been talking about today that kate sandra does so if you go to uh the certifications page at datasacks.com you can actually sign up for the mailing list to get notifications about this program we've launched a training course and we have about half of the modules done we think there's going to be about nine learning modules for this course and we've got we've already got four of them out there and and more coming every couple of weeks so we're trying to get this material this is a fast changing area just trying to get things out to you as quick as we can um and just to emphasize you know we we want to be highly interactive and so please connect with us if you haven't already uh on on whatever your favorite social platform is and then um i've opened up some spots on my calendar and so is alex uh i'm interested in hearing what your experience is like running kate sandra like how you think you're you're intending to use it or how you think you might use it or what are you curious about how it works did you run into problems getting it running do you think the documentation could be better any of those things um you know grab a half an hour on our calendar and we'd love to sit down and talk with you we really want to build this community out around running cassandra on kubernetes because we think that it's really the wave of the future like this is the way that moving forward there's probably going to be more cassandra running on kubernetes than anywhere else i like what you've done there with my talking head alex that's pretty good yeah i mean you were hiding your calendly link so i have to move it oh yeah don't hide my calendar link it's really simple um and we could put it in the chat there too or maybe david will help me out because he's like a mad link pasting guy yeah exactly uh and yeah i think that's really it yeah no no do you want to do some questions yeah take a look you wasn't doing live workshops for almost one year and you missed how did i forget i know i know no no no don't forget my t people will my undying shame remind you anyway don't worry nothing bad happened we still don't but i have to say to all the attendees don't worry we're still running manti that's all that's it all good all good so for manti i'm switching manti i'm switching it to my screen and good so let's play a game top three places getting the prizes and don't forget jump back that's mendy.com use the code oops 7162049 or scan the qr code next to jeff and jump in we can't wait to start because there is a lot of interesting happening and you can win the prizes so so so so 24 people like no way 25 that's not serious i will not start with such low numbers really i need more thumbs up then you jump in push that thumbs up i will know what you are in 30 people that's already getting somewhere but no no no people no quiz we did a good job doing that so now we need you to do the good job and jump in and win some nice slack we have almost 100 people on youtube and i need at least 50 before we go on or we just close the workshop no homework no quiz no nothing i hope you are going to change that yeah okay 40 people few more joints and we will start don't forget now this this is a quiz there is a competition there are a few dozens of people participating so what you are going to do is to be very focused watch your mobile phone screens not youtube because youtube has a little delay and afterwards you're going to answer very quickly but give me the correct answers five more seconds jump in five four three two one and we are starting who is late is late so question one of oh my god press enter to start coming down okay answer fast to get more points what is kate sandra what is kate sandra cassandra vivian integrated data lake maria db on kubernetes deployment tool kubernetes native cassandra with built-in operation tools the sister of kate and sandra so okay most of you fans were italian and the correct answer is kate sandra is kubernetes kubernetes native cassandra with built-in operations tools it was easy but that's just a warm up there are some more complicated questions for you then and i see some answers uh cassandra i've even integrated data lake that's not the correct answer that's not the correct answer so leaderboard what is the leaderboard who was the fastest casper was the fastest if john on the second place and croc on the third but you know what in the beginning they're always like that and difference is so low so point to point let's take a look how it goes after the second question and second question starts now question number two answer fast to get more points ingress allows for communication to the internal kubernetes from the outside network true or false today we are so gentle jeff we give them like some time to warm up some simple questions time time time is almost over last second okay it was again too simple we need to add more tricky questions but not in the beginning so let me see how you did that who was the fastest one and who was the slowest casper not alex their penguin okay but are there any changes bell was fastest and bell jumps directly to a fourth place with one point different to the third place very well then one point is like what is it is microsecond something like that so winners don't relax that's not yet that finished bell go that was a good work and well i have no idea who is on the second place with 191 917 points that's no but we know who it's not it's not yeah it's definitely not alex 100 so question three answer fast to get more points what is the reaper we didn't spend too much time on it but don't fear the reaper yeah don't fear the reaper in cassandra world reaper is your friend so is it a backup and restore tool is it an anti-entropy tool is it a data deletion tool or is it a pretty green person okay that was the tricky question most of the people got into i always have some traps for you so reaper oh that was a definite trap wow no no no who says what reaper is a backup in restaurant tool i've just shown you we need reaper to win to keep the data consistent to a get rid of entropy to keep your data consistent reaper is to repair your data and this way counteract entropy make your data consistent it's not for backup and raster if you are looking for backup investor you need meduza which is already in case andra and we are going to show it very soon but for now reaper and reaper is your friend so i expect a lot of changes this time but take a look all of the winners are here none of the vendors made a mistake and not alex was the fastest one that you know it's kind of not really it feels bad not alex was the fastest one okay so i don't not not jeff has not even made the leaderboard i don't i'm not sure what's happening with that yeah that's weird okay so we have not alex on the first place vs on the second place janos on the third one ping ping get out from the top three to the fourth but still very small difference and bell holding the fifth place getting ready for the attack to a top free list okay so we have something happening here and here comes the next question question number four answer fast to get more points what is the stargate repair tool supporting reaper the cap and restore tool data gateway to upgrade your data api tv series oh not easy not easy time is up oh yeah okay still easy people listening to you jeff so stargate is the data gateway to use multiple possible apis like rest graphql uh document and still keep your data in cassandra like take care of your data in many ways but still using all the awesomeness of cassandra it's not repair tool it's not a backup restaurant tool and well no one answered it's a tv series okay so are there any changes on the leaderboard no mistakes but a different pace different reaction time ping bean was the fastest getting back to the top three directly to the second place with 377 points well done penguin and you know what this uh has an uh profile picture of a crocodile i think someone is having identity crisis uh something like that but uh i'm not here to judge stay strong they're punching you will be good we are together with you and not alex is holding the first place who is that and the ownership is on the third place bell keep fighting like just four points there's rampant speculation as to the identity of not alex there's all kinds of rumors i see it okay so let's take a look then what happens next we are very close to the end of the competition question number five ask for fast to get more points what is helm a package management tool for kubernetes a drop-in replacement for kubernetes next generation database the king's head yeah helmets and you think even for experienced cassandra people no kubernetes people but the answer is oh it was too simple was it a kid sandra workshop or helm workshop you were supposed to make more mistakes here great job i'm just kidding so package management tool it just took everyone a while to warm up yeah well it's not exactly the package management tool it's not an apt-get or hume of course but it's doing it's working in a very similar way you adding repository you deploy the system describe it in the manifest and it's not a drop in replacement for kubernetes 100 so what are the changes on the list of the winners no mistakes again vs was a bit too slow this time i'm sorry touch was the fastest one getting to the eighth place great job touch all right but still some fighting happens and take a look how top i would say top four positions are really point to point to point like that's very close 20 points different 30 points difference but taj is coming up on the outside yeah this is getting tight that's a real competition i could tell you okay so let's take a look what comes next and that's going to be the sixth question answer fast to get more points kate sandra uses traffic as dependency management tool kubernetes ingress monitoring tool air control service well it's kinda air control service it's very close to it i would say a lot of similar ideas behind i would say but most of you answer it correctly it's a kubernetes ingress managing incoming uh connections to your kubernetes cluster and dispatching them to appropriate services including cassandra it's not a monitoring tool although it has a very nice monitoring dashboard indeed but it's not a monitoring tool and it's not a dependency management tool so one question left there are no mistakes by the leaders again but some people are getting faster janos was the fastest one getting to the top getting into the place great great that was a very quick answer i can say their penguin gets from the first to a second but that's still enough you know we have no difference in our prizes so first second and third place are getting the same price and so don't be too sad about that second price out of the dozens of people it's a great result and bell finally gets into the top three exactly like yeah well job last question last question don't sleep on jasper as well yeah yeah just beer is very close and that's again like 35 points difference so that's enough to make and to make a jump and um ravikiran ray d is also very close but there is a bigger difference to others okay so let the battle commence ladies and gentlemen that's the last question in our quiz question number seven warm up your fingers warm up your fingers open up your eyes prepare that's going to be the last one i would say winner takes it all but no first replays stakes at all answer fast to get more points what's the purpose of graffana cluster management time series database data visualization tool no purpose grafana is useless oh don't answer too quickly yeah but don't answer too slow as well don't put don't answer too slowly [Laughter] time is up time is up and the correct answer is grafana is a data visualization tool we use prometheus as a time series database for the metrics and it's definitely not a cluster management graphana is a data visualization tool a great one actually i spent a lot of time on grafana during the last year so how do you feel i think we are done jeff i think we are done i think yeah my wife is waiting for me for a dinner i think we are done i'm going to stop the translation no we still have something oh my goodness oh yeah i think we do don't don't tease like that okay so leaderboard leaderboard is no mistakes on winners and we have a lot of past answers and not alex getting the fastest answer but still getting on the top place we congratulate bell with the third place their penguin with a second place successfully defended and janus got the first place with no mistakes done and very very very good speed and the answers so janusz their penguin bell please make the screenshots of your phones or i don't know maybe you're using laptops computers whatever send them to jack dot friar at datastax.com and enjoy your well-deserved prizes for others who didn't make to the top three but made in top ten it's a great achievement you were competing with dozens of people it's a big achievement to be in the top ten and if you are not in top ten still don't be sad today we spend so many time to together learning new things so you learned music you got the biggest prize of all exactly knowledge is priceless and one thing is more prices than knowledge is your salary and you are attending data stacks developers you are learning new skills that inevitably affects your salary in the end so that's the biggest price i would say okay so one last question before you quit mentee quick survey to help us how do you like the workshop now i'm worried i know our bosses are watching this stream so if we get a low low rate it's like maybe not too good for us is that true i hate it when i go someplace and the person uh behind the counter says to me now you're going to get a survey you need to give me a five out of five or i or i get fired or whatever it is right or i don't get my bonus or i'm like quit playing with my emotions yeah well what i really want to say is i want you to be honest but we spent with us two and a half hours i know you liked it otherwise you would be quite the ratings uh the ratings are good but if you have written like specific comments or even better so that's my next question any feedback for this workshop or future topics we should cover maybe this is my favorite part people sometimes giving great feedback or great advices let me hide us so people will be able to put their yeah great job yeah they like it i like to see more reaper next time oh yes me too i'm sorry very good workshop kafka sounds interesting uh we have something uh also very interesting uh talking about kafka or even streaming uh apache pulsar we already did apache pulsar workshop and we will do it again uh break in between and love and hands-on require it break in between well break in between maybe makes sense because it's two and a half hours together so little break makes sense um great workshop thank you looking forward to see more on stargate definitely definitely yeah more on story there's a lot to talk about there yeah indeed so you know what i will keep this window open and i invite you to uh write some more feedback or invite or in ideas we will get back to it later now i'm switching to another screen i wanted to mention again that was it yes this one so last points uh about uh what do you do now homework homework as said theory alone is not enough what we suggest you to do again you read you watch this workshop already do the practice steps contact me link is in the v key to get your cloud instance if you can do it on your own if you can do it on your own great then do the steps and submit your homework how do you submit your homework answer is simple i'm getting to the where is my oh my god there is my link for that this one uh how do you submit your homework you go to kate sandra workshop and there is an issues part if you are using github you must be familiar with that then you push the button create new issue and there is a template homework assignment we prepare it for you so you push the button get started yep and you just fill it like that in the topic you replace the name with your name you put your linkedin profile link that's important for us so we will publish your upgrade complete attach the homework screenshots below for the next one we may decide on the some formal requirements but for now we just want to see you doing the steps so if you have it running if you have your api queries executed if you have your repairs running then you are good you just attach your screenshot here and we will you push the button submit new issue so i will do it like that alex oops alex and link it in profile link okay let it be just alex for now i am putting my screenshot here whatever good replace it and now i'm submitting this boom done and uh which parts you have to do if you would do altogether it brings pretty a lot of things to do so we discussed it with jeff and we decided what we don't want to make you all the steps but we want you to choose the most interesting for you so definitely setting up cassandra monitoring cassandra it's simple but working with data if you're a developer that's very required stargate if you are interested into the apis running repairs if you are more into the operations that's definitely what matters and get your bail get your linkedin page get your uh well well well-deserved acknowledgement and i think that's it for today jeff do you have anything to ought hmm no i don't think so i've already got a couple of uh uh time slots booked on my calendar so that's great great looking forward to talking more with everyone about about this stuff yep so i think that makes us complete for today and maintenance done questions is done thank you so much and that was uh jeff carpenter and alex wolvesnev datastocks team developer relations team helping you to be a better engineer and enjoying that a lot see you next workshop we always have a lot of evidence for you [Music] formats to change [Music] me [Music] you",
