to get going here in just a minute with some really fun content for you today but for now just chill watch a music video on databases yes read those subtitles i'm not kidding it's an edm song on databases so you should definitely uh take a listen all right we'll be with you in just a minute [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right hello everybody and welcome to our implement a react native mobile app workshop today i am david jones gilardi i'm joined by sonya siganporya sonia hello say hello to everybody all right so real quick before we get going into the core of the content can i just get a confirmation um that you can hear us and that you can see us let's give us some thumbs up to make sure that you can hear us and see us and we want to make sure we're good before we uh get going oh johnson while we're waiting what are we building today so today we're gonna we're gonna actually implement and deploy a react native mobile app we'll talk about more in here in a minute all right yes reheat finally and i see a bunch of yeses coming through wonderful okay so it sounds like it sounds like everyone can hear us and stuff like that great all right so let's go ahead and kind of you know just get into the content and talk a little bit about what we're going to do today um so first thing just a couple housekeeping items to to go through um it's myself and sonia with you today here on screen but in the chats we have a whole team of us right so ask your questions that's part of why we do these we do them live this is an interactive session it's meant for you to ask your questions i've seen some folks that are saying hey i'm a beginner and stuff like that don't be afraid no questions bad or anything like that so we've got a team of folks here to help you out now this is the overall agenda right this is um you know this is what we're going to kind of expect to do the first thing obviously now we're doing some of the housekeeping then we're just going to give a brief overview of this project right so if you've been with us before um and one of our previous workshops we actually have another to-do app workshop that we do using react now the difference with the previous workshop is that one builds it up completely from scratch right um if you're brand new to react i highly suggest it i'll show you some links later um but that one will help you create your first react app and you know how do you how do you kind of work with it how do you work with the database and all sorts of things this workshop what we're going to do now is we're going to extend past that we're going to take the original to do app that was in react and then we're going to make it react native we're going to move it to react native uh and deploy that you know up to production database back end and the whole thing right and the key thing here is this you know what did that actually look like going from react rack native what kind of like choices did we need to make what kind of tech stacks were there all sorts of things right so you can see there in sections three and four we're going to have a lot on the kind of react rack native and what that looks like and then we'll round it out you know kind of looking at some of the native features because there's a definite difference when you're doing a web app compared to a native mobile app there are definitely some differences as far as like the ui and flow and then we'll finish up with some resources okay so just a couple things from the housekeeping end um of course you're probably watching us up on youtube in the top left there um you know at any point by the way uh if you ever want to you can always go to our twitch channel we have our data sex devs twitch we usually use twitch as kind of a backup right um so if you're watching us here you're fine but if you prefer twitch that's fine just understand that we're watching the questions in youtube chat and in discord not twitch right so if you have questions make sure you're asking one of those then on the top right hand side you'll see the dts dtsx.io link to discord so the discord channel here's the difference in youtube when the session ends today the chat's going to stop right but if you want to continue the conversation if you have follow-up questions or anything like that the discord is definitely the place to go um so i would um chances are the team is probably putting the discord link down but the discord link you can see it up there in the top right hand corner right now our discord channel we have a community of about 15 000 people in there um it's it's pretty live and everything like that it's a really nice place to go especially if you've got follow-up questions or if you have longer form questions or maybe you need to post a screenshot or something like that you know it's things like that you can't really do in the youtube chat then on the bottom we have menti.com which we're going to go to in a moment menti is what we're going to use first ask you some questions for that okay so some of the tools what are we doing today you know are there prerequisites that kind of thing first thing uh the top left-hand corner is we're going to use github so github is the place where the workshop repository is everything we are doing today has been built to be self-service you could totally do it at your own pace separate from the live session today if you wanted um and everything you need is in the repo and we'll be dropping the repo link to you as we go through then on the top right hand side you see git pod so if you're not familiar with gitpod gitpod is a cloud-based ide right so for the brothers for those of you who are used to using something like maybe like intellij or vs code or something like that you do it locally gitpod allows you to do this up in the cloud what's really cool about this is we get to pre-bake all the configuration the libraries and everything you need so you can just click a button and go right as compared to having to load everything locally and everything like that so um we do highly suggest that you go ahead and just use gitpod with us if you're going to do this along with us then in the bottom left-hand corner you see astrodb so this whole implementation this to do app that we're going to build with react native and in a native mobile app it's the full end-to-end thing though it's not just the to-do app it's actually backed by a data layer um we're going to um we're going to push it as a jam stack up up to netlify you know there's the whole thing so astrodb is the database the cloud-based serverless database that we're gonna use for that uh to power the back-end that's so when you're writing your to-do's and you're doing things that's where uh they're all being stored and such and then finally in the lower right here and there you see expo uh so we're going to talk in more detail about what i'm just about to say but we decided for this native mobile app to go the route of expo and what that really means is uh for those of you who've done native mobile app development before um you would normally need to download things like xcode and android studio and bring all these resources locally to be able to do local development xpo allows us along with react native to code in a single language and then deploy out to all those devices we'll go through all of that um so by the way i want to be clear all of the stuff we use everything in our workshops is absolutely free there is no point where you should be charged anything or anything like that so all these tools are all in the cloud and free you should be able to do this whole workshop from your browser okay so let's go over to mentee by the way while i'm switching over to mentee here's our mentee so either scan the qr code or if you uh go to the code down there you see in the bottom left-hand corner that 4977-7253 or scan the qr code this will bring up mentee and give us a thumbs up let us know you're here so i should see down here i should see this starting to light up there we go i saw one come in awesome so we'll give everybody a moment to get to this and let's check how are we doing are there any questions that i need to know about let's see all right just i see yes this session is recorded by the way i saw some questions there um there we go good all right i see about 47 people in how many do we have all right i'll give everyone another minute to get the menti going we've got almost 400 of you with us today so we'll get more in the mentee again just scan that qr code or go to mentee.com oh thank you cedric i see do i have hairs cedric you're gonna have to clarify that question for me all right we have like a hundred all right why don't we go ahead and i'll move forward with the mentee now by the way the code is up top as well so if you're just coming in now and you're like ah where's the code it's up top so the first thing i want to do is just ask a couple questions we want to get to know you a little bit more first one how much experience do you have with native mobile development oh looks like we have some veterans in here a bunch of never done it before oh fun see sonia you got your you got your work cut out for you see no pressure sonia you have to be perfectly perfectly clear and concise everybody oh okay so we we have a couple folks we have one person more than five years that's wonderful excellent so it seems like the most of you are are pretty new to this and everything um i will be very curious um as to your thoughts um you know on the path we took and and such like that all right wonderful all right have you ever used react native before oh and by the way if you're answering in the youtube chat which i see a bunch of coming through make sure to answer in the mentee so i'll put the code up again for you because this is going to be important for the swag quiz later this is where we're going to go for the swag quiz so make sure that you are answering in menti all right looks like it looks like some of you have but it looks like the vast majority have not all right you know for those of you who have used react native before um definitely curious as you see us go through this process and everything like that um to your thoughts maybe you have some suggestions or some lessons learned you've run into i would definitely love to see those in the chat all right last one uh have you been to any of our workshops before welcome to some of our folks that are coming back all right oh we have a lot of folks coming back today hey wonderful and welcome welcome to all of our new folks with us today wonderful to see everybody here all right excellent all right thank you so with that thank you everyone for answering leave this window open because we're gonna do our swag quiz with this later so it'll make it much easier uh for you to be able to get into the swag quiz later alright so first thing i want to do is do a quick demo right so i'm just going to pop over to my screen i can make this a little bigger i guess so simply enough there's actually really two things per this the second part of this will be kind of um kind of funny because i have to pick up my phone and hopefully it shows in the camera we'll see how that goes um but the to-do list you know from an app standpoint it's pretty simple right um you've got items that you can add let's see um well ryan already likes to take over the world maybe i can eat a lot more chocolate right um so from the to-do list standpoint um there we go um you know it's you you enter in items items show up you know you have each item is a tuada item they show up here you can you know complete them you know you can look at the completed ones you can look at the active ones you can say delete them you know very simple kind of crud operations you know create read update delete kind of application right it is about as simple as they come now here's the big difference if you have done our previous workshop or or just in react then what you'd end up with is a to-do item or a to-do list that looks something like this but it's more like a web app here's the difference though and maybe you can see this let's see how well this i don't know that that's going to render there you go right so now you can see on my iphone i have the to-do list app as well now the difference though is this isn't just running in a browser i don't have it just running in like safari or chrome or something like that it's actually running as a native app and this is being enabled through the whole react native piece and in order for it to show up on my phone like that i actually had to deploy it out in to you know a a production global site where i can access it publicly on my phone right this is not local development or anything like that i'm not doing that through uh xcode or i'm not doing that through any kind of like um you know local connected development over my local network or something so that is the end result that's where we want to get today so we're going to take this to-do list app we're going to look at what it took to go from react rack native and then we're gonna we're gonna deploy this thing um up in our our production servers all right how are we doing on questions we have anything we need to answer real quick let's see and okay it looks like questions are good all right great great then with that we'll get in to the overview and i will give it over to sonia we can totally seriously sonia we're seeing everything let me know when you can see it okay oh we got it yeah we can see it awesome okay so like david said the goal of this workshop is to convert our existing react to web app that's from another workshop we teach into a react native web and mobile app so don't worry you don't need anything from that previous workshop but we're going to walk you through all the steps we took to convert from that react app to react native um so here you can see the two different versions of the to do web app so before in the bottom left um we had just the basic create a complete um delete application and you could also filter the to do's in the bottom footer and then here on the top right you can see the end product that we ended up with we've added some ui and additional mobile features like swiping and we moved the filter from the bottom to the top into a segment of control we'll walk through how we created those here you can see the mobile versions of the app so it looks very similar in web and mobile um and you can see that at the end of this workshop you'll have a complete implementation of this app working on your phone as well as in your browser um so the original challenge with mobile development is that if you wanted to build a mobile app and a web app on ios android and web you'd have to build the same application three times on three platforms in three different languages so for example if you wanted to build for ios you'd have to build it in swift on xcode if you wanted to build for android you'd have to build in java kotlin in android studio and if you wanted to build for web for example you'd use javascript in a range of ides like visual studio um that's a lot of platforms and that's a lot of different languages that's a lot of extra work um and so the um the value add of platforms like react native and flutter rather frameworks is that you can build it once and use the same code base to have apps working on all three platforms now sonya um i do have something that we should probably clarify um i saw a question from chinmaya and some others on youtube what exactly do we mean by a native mobile app yeah no it's a great question so to just put it super simply native means that the application will work on that particular platform's ios so it'll work on an android phone or it'll work on an ios device um it'll work on a mac os operating system on your computer um so it's based on it works natively using native features on that operating system david does that encapsulate everything i believe so i was actually responding to a question so i wasn't actually listening to you but it sounded okay great okay um so hopefully if there are more questions feel free to continue asking them in the chat and i'll get back to them um so originally when we were going through the process of figuring out which framework to use for converting our original react app we looked at flutter and expo um and expo is the is a expands on react native and adds a few more features and just manages it a little bit for you and you could also use react native um cli as well to create the app um so we decided to go with react native because we already had the web app written in javascript and react so it was a more natural transition than recreating the entire thing from scratch again in dart which is flutter's um programming language so what does expo offer in addition to react native so an expo basically enables you to use the same javascript or typescript code base to develop build deploy and quickly iterate on your ios android and web apps using react and react native components um you even have access to the expo go mobile app which can act as your simulator on your personal mobile phone um so you don't need to actually download xcode and android studio if they're both really heavy and sometimes can really lag on your actual computer if you don't have a lot of computing power or network access um expo also offers snack which is like a browser-based playground that supports emulators for android ios and web um which also offers you another way to see your app as you're building you know one thing i'd like to i want to address here because you guess latte asked a great question he says expo has certain disadvantages also right and yes so expo is great to get started it is wonderful like one of the things we're able to do with expo is the fact that all of us are going to be able to do this on the cloud together and on our phones using just expo you don't have to download xcode like sonia was saying you don't have to download the android studio and you don't have to worry about you know doing local development from that standpoint so it's a great tool to get started where it can later on so you know it kind of gets you going right but later on depending on the kind of material the content you're pushing you might be limited like there's you know um you can make actual like one of the cool features of it is you can actually make like real-time updates to your app uh you know even in ios right without having to push back out to the store but if you need to change certain items right if you need some more advanced capabilities then expo is going to start to kind of like have you know diminishing returns at that end of things but when you're first getting started and stuff it's it's a wonderful platform so yeah there can be some disadvantages um but for our purposes today of just kind of introducing what this might look like it's great for starting up is there anything else you want to add to that sonya or sure yeah so one of the things that when i was going through and learning about expo a lot is you can start off with a managed expo um project and then you can also export it to just react native bear or expo bear and that reduces some of the friction in trying to expand some of the custom features if you're finding expo to be challenging so a lot of times you can start an expo and then move forward depending on what you end up needing so to give you a little background on how expo works um expo has two main parts um the dev server and the metro bundler packager and the metlo metro bundler just to put it shortly compiles all of your javascript code into a single file um and then also converts your assets into objects so they can be viewable on mobile um while the dev server takes your javascript bundle created by the packager the metro bundler and runs it inside the expo app in your simulator um so that means that you can then see your app running on your mobile device or in the simulator on your computer um expo also offers a tunnel process which is what we're going to use in git pod today to make everyone able to see the app that they create on their cloud um and view it on their phone which allows your devices to be accessible outside of your lan um so you can access these servers without you needing to change your firewall settings and the command for that will be exposed start tunnel we'll walk through all of that um so to give you a little insight into netlify netlifedev the command we're going to use allows you to build and test your web apps on your local machine and in this case serverless functions by running its production routing engine in a local dev server so on your computer or your phone and injecting the right environment variables in as well um so it the key for us was really injecting the right environment variables because we need to configure that based on the platform you're running it on so if you're running on git pod you need certain environment variables if you're running on your phone you need other environment configurations if you're running locally the amount of complexity that when you go from just doing like regular web app you know web application development with something like react or any javascript frameworks and such and then going to mobile especially for our our mobile native veterans that we saw um from our question earlier i'll be very curious to see your your thoughts on this as well but the honestly the complexity goes from like here to over here right um because there's a lot more moving parts right you've got to test against all these different platforms you have emulators to use the sony which is talking about they have different network requirements it makes it a little more interesting for sure um so we're gonna we're gonna try to help you with all that today yeah this was definitely the most challenging part of the conversion and and getting everything to run was trying to work with all these three different networking requirements and getting them all to align and meet each other okay david i think it's back to you yes it is now actually i'm gonna pop back to the other uh let me just get to where we need to go okay one thing i do want to say there we go uh one thing i do want to say about this slide that sonia was just telling you if you've heard now all of a sudden we've talked about for a moment we've talked about react we've talked about expo we talked about netlify and if you're like whoa what are all of these things right one thing i would like to point out is in our uh and let me know if the zoom is okay i pre-zoomed on this but this is the repo that we shared with you earlier right so this is our native mobile app one thing i want to point out though is right here that if you are completely new to react right if you've not done anything new you know with react before and you're not sure about this stuff or you don't know what jam stack is or whatever go take a look at our previous workshop this is the one where we start the to-do app we build it react we go into a lot more detail with things like the netlify piece and such like that we're not really getting to the details of that today because we're going to be spending our time doing this con you know kind of going over what this conversion from react react native is like right um uh i would really suggest that again if you're new to react and you're new to like doing web development take a look at this one now do you have to do that before this workshop no we give you all the instructions you should be able to do with this but if you want to like create your first react app you know and kind of be stepped through how the to-do app works that's the place to go so i just wanted to point that out before we continue on all right and okay then the last part here before we get into our first exercise really is this whole this is just a high high level of the architecture you know the general architecture that we're working with so yes we have the to do native mobile app that we're going to deploy but what are we deploying it on right um so you know we've got we've got the client that a lot of the rack native that's really where you know the presentation view is really where a lot of this work was done but still you know you've got the back end you have the piece that when you're using the to do app it's actually going to talk over you know rest endpoints uh to do things in the data layer and so we're gonna have a full database and everything um we're gonna be deploying the whole thing to netlife that's where netify comes together um that is gonna be when you actually deploy it and push it up to nutlify and do that part this is that application back end here then we have astrodb for the data layer so you're actually doing a full end-to-end deployment in this case i just want you to be aware of that part it is not just the to do app it's actually a full and an appointment and the hope with that is that you can take some of this knowledge and then you're able to apply to your own apps because what's really cool about this stuff and we talk about this a lot when we're talking about especially for full stack um front end devs and things like that is that now you can pretty much code up the whole life cycle including what was traditionally back-end services were like serverless functions and you can power them with things like netlify you can power them things with uh astrodb and both of those cases have free tiers and they both scale indefinitely so if you're wanting to start some you know if you have an idea for a new app or something like that and you're like hey i i want a platform where i can deploy this thing that's you're actually going to be deploying on that today all right so before we do this let's see how are we doing on questions let's see anything i see some yeah vicky pale asks why choose react native uh there are already many other frameworks available yeah right so sony addressed this a little bit earlier but really what it comes down to is our to-do app in this particular case was already in react we actually have a lot of react expertise here on the team uh so we chose to go the react native route in in that standpoint uh from that standpoint we also if you notice i keep referencing back to the previous to-do app we're looking at this is like a continuation like how would i take that and then move it to react native so that had a large you know degree to do with why we went react native the other part of it though was when we looked at flutter and we were comparing like flutter you know like the different tech stacks like you know flutter and expo and react native and other libraries another key factor as sony was talking about before is that if you use something like flutter in order for us to do a workshop like this especially online um you would have to download xcode you'd have to download android studio you'd have to do all that xcode was something like 11 gigabytes uh in many cases nobody will finish downloading that by the time we're done with the workshop so there's no doubt that because we're doing this all up in the cloud that and we already have a lot of react expertise we chose react native for for that particular reason so it wasn't like we were making some judgment call or something like that and saying rec native is better it's just the one we chose yes yes that's a good point yogesh um says choosing rack native offers advantage of platform independency as well yeah that's a very good point okay uh sonia any other questions anything you want to answer nothing right now i'm just trying to follow along in the chat movies i see another neat question as we get into this uh from sana between react native and flutter which one would you prefer you know that's a neat question because i'll tell you even though flutter requires you to download the the development environments for the different platforms it actually has some really cool tools like flutter was really capable um so it was it was one of those things where you know as i went as i was going through it in sunny as we were kind of we did a big comparison between them it the the thing that put it over the edge was the fact that we could do all this in the cloud um because flutter again has some really nice capabilities as well i would love to hear from some of our mobile native veterans that are on with us if they have uh feelings on that as well all right so let's get into our first insta our first exercise i almost said first instance so what we want to do and i guess i should just kind of briefly explain um the way the repo works you'll see a set of objectives at the top um you know they're they're in this case from a prerequisite standpoint if you don't need if you don't have a github account you will need to create one again that's free if you want to do the full thing where you're going to publish this to your mobile device you're going to need to use expogo could you do it as a web app right in your browser yes but it's not the same experience right that's up to you right so we'll we'll have the instruction on that later uh either in you know both the ios or android stores um again all that is free from that standpoint um all right so another thing i want to point out as we get in to the first thing is the homework right so if you want to do the homework you'll see this link that is right here then you just click on that and that's where you'll submit the thing for your homework you can get yourself a nice badge that says that you've actually done the work and everything we actually have a ton of these badges i think we have more than a dozen now um of different workshops and everything so if you're interested in that i just want to point that out because we see that question a lot okay so the first thing let's go ahead and put in we're gonna go to step one yeah priya what is exactly is astron why do we need it so aster db is going to be our data layer that is going to be the backing database like i said we're actually going to deploy this thing um to you know a real production site using netlify and when you are doing things with the to do apps any um anytime you interact with the to-do item or create one or delete one you're actually writing that to a back-end data store that's where astrodb comes into play all right so first thing here is you'll see this crate asked me now what i'm going to do i'm just going to slowly step through all of this with you right if you want to follow along and you want to do this with me wonderful if you want to do it later totally up to you right but i'm going to slowly step through this with you and go through it kind of like i was doing it the first time one thing i'm going to suggest by the way when you create you know when you click on these buttons or links unfortunately markdown doesn't let us use target blank so you need to either control click or middle click or say right click and open link in new tab otherwise it's just going to replace your repo so you'll see i went to another tab and i pulled it over now when you create astra for the first time if you've never done it before you can register with github or google or just type in your what you want to choose in my case since i have i'm just going to go ahead and log in and i'll make sure to zoom once we get in here okay now if you're a first-time user you're going to see a little bit different screen you should see a button though that says start for free right everything we're going to do is free there's a very generous free tier and stuff like that that's for both astrodb and netlify so again you shouldn't have to pay anything but you want to say you know start free and then you're going to get a screen that looks something like this it says create a database and you'll see that we've provided some values for you here like the database name i'm going to put in database name and then the key space the key space by the way is just our table or our container of tables if you're coming from the relational world then uh that would be like a database or a schema right it's just the container of tables so notice i want to have to do's native workshop db as my database name and then to do's is the key space and again this is the data layer we're going to use to power the back end of our to-do app yes start free now button harsh exactly start free now all right then for the provider and region that you see down here you can choose any of them uh really what this comes down to is um we as as part of astrodb it provides any you know you can use any one of the three major cloud providers you don't need to log in with those you don't need to register with them there's no cost to you or anything like that you can just choose one it's it's really about having the choice of what vendor you want to use today i'm going to use google cloud just pick a region close to you right i'm over in north america i'm in the east so i'll pick south carolina once you've filled out the database name the key space name and you selected a provider in region you'll see create database over here will light up and just go ahead and click on that yeah tron you can totally come back later um matter of fact that's a good reason to go to our discord channel and come chat with us if you want um and you can this will be saved this will be recorded so you can okay that's what the team was telling me about all right there we go yeah so you can totally come back later and and do this with us anytime all right so what'll happen is once you create uh your database you might see it go into like um you might see an initializing or it might say um preparing or something like that that's fine once you've created the database then you're good to move on yep i'm here i'm gonna wait and as a matter of fact um once you get to a point where you see that database being created let us know and yep i'll let everybody get caught up again do you if you need me to do that again um let me know and i can go through the process one more time yes it's free yes and like i said once you create this you see it say pending or initializing yeah i'm i'm actually talking to the team about that right now make sure we're all good so if you see an oops or something like that that's all right we can we can move forward for that all right give me just a second here all right all right we're there we go i'll just do this again okay oh uh gunthread um the it's not a certificate for the workshop itself um but what it is if you complete the homework you can get a badge we'll give you a badge for that all right i think for some of you who are having um a hard time with the database what we're gonna do is we're just gonna come back to that we don't absolutely have to do that part just yet so we will come back to that and valeen yes astr does work with an api um you can use rest you can use a document api with json objects you can use a graphql uh grpc is coming right so there's multiple apis you can use with the um drivers all right all right let me go ahead and all right so what we're gonna do then just for now let's skip the three let's skip to step three deploy to netlify yep we're gonna skip right now go to step three because we can wait for this as i'm talking to the team uh i think we already know what's going on there and they are fixing it right now so i'm gonna skip the three i just put those links here yep see here if you have the oops let's just skip on to the deployed and netlify step so what we want to do here is again i'm going to say right click open a new tab and then deploy the notify button and i'll move this over to this other screen and you'll see this connect to github button so what this is going to do this is actually really cool so netlify is essentially the deployment of our web app right in our mobile native app that's where we're going to deploy it to so when you say connect to github it's going to go through your github account so this is where you need to have github and then it's going to take and it's going to create a brand new repo for you this workshop to do native mobile and you say save deploy it's going to go ahead and create a version of this in your own github account right so you're actually going to get a copy of it so you should see a screen like this yeah um um you don't have to fork it that's actually something that what's going to happen here is netlify is going to do that for you right i'm going to explain that here in a moment so once you get to this page you guys if you if you've gotten here give me a thumbs up let me know that you've gotten to the netlify page and that you're deploying the site all right see some thumbs up coming in wonderful yep that's okay richie yeah go ahead and just move on to the to the net if i step we'll come back to astra yeah we can do these separate good all right i see lots of all right all right let me um okay good so once you've gotten to this point what i want you to do is click on the site deploy in progress and what you'll see here is the first deployment right so if i click on this and notify you're actually going to see it building the app right it's actually building the to-do app you should recommend for those of you who are familiar with react npm things like that you'll see some stuff that's pretty familiar yep anjali this session is being recorded so you can always go back to it and do it later all right then what you're looking for is it's going to go through the full deployment you see this netify build so what's happening here is the first time that you push the netlify it's actually grabbing all the code and everything in the app from the github repository and it is building it it's actually going to build the app um you'll start to see um some things like expo build web here so we're building the the mobile web app and we'll let nullify do its thing um karen would i clicked if i go back okay um i went originally you'd be here i went to site deploy in progress i clicked there you see these deploys and then i click on the deploy itself and that will show me the log there you go all right so we're going to let these build we'll let that bake for a moment and so i saw a bunch of thumbs up here i'm going to go ahead and go back over to sonya who is then going to move into some of the next content and start looking at what we did from react rack native so we can get into that core of the content while we're waiting for netlify to do its thing all right son you're you ready over there yep give me a second to just present all righty all right let me know there you go oh you are good to go all right so like i said just get to that netlify step and then we'll let that bake and sonia is going to bring us through this other content so now we're going to walk through step by step how to convert a react app into react native um the first thing to note is what's the real difference like why do we care um so both are open source by facebook they're utilized in applications like facebook instagram discord which you're using now um airbnb pinterest ubereats skype and salesforce um so really heavily used with great ui um so just to clarify the differences between react naval and react react.js because oftentimes they're um confused with each other so react native is a framework that allows you to build native cross-platform mobile apps so really in short just meant for mobile and react rack react.js is a javascript library that used for constructing a high-performing ui layer so that's why we are able to just take react as our base app and build upon it using react native and i'll walk through all the differences and what we have to do step by step to convert it one of the main differences is react uses html and css to construct the ui whereas react native uses its own components and libraries um so the first step that we did is you create a bear expo app or bare react native app depending on what cli you're using um and then you want to take originally we had our app.js file in the source folder and you have to move that out of that into the root directory because expo is looking for a root component for your app so that's the first key step and then from our original react app we copied over the following folders we copied over the source folder which had all of our components that we built the functions folder which is like all our api calls um the node node modules um so all of the packages and libraries that we need to get our app to run we also copied over our package.json which we're going to keep adding to as we add more libraries that we need to run this app our netlify configuration file which is the netlify tomo and our environment variables file.env and then you want to just make sure you do npm install to install the packages in your new environment and by the way i i should point out that um the expo documentation both react native and exposed sites like when you go to their sites are really good their documentation is is is pretty uh pretty solid from that standpoint so all the stuff that sonia is talking about and everything yes it's in the slides that are in the repo so you have this for reference um but that's not the only thing you have right um if you go to both uh react rack native site and if you take a look at expo they'll they'll kind of bring you through all this if if you want to do this with your own applications as well yep they're very detailed super easy to follow and you know we've basically highlighted all of the complicated parts you know that took us a few steps to go through um yeah so just just a summary some of the key code differences um the main one is html tags are no longer valid um and you have to use react native components so you can see here some of the parallels so instead of div use view and react native instead of input you use text input instead of a list use a flat list so another example of something that's different is css is no longer there which adds additional complications and instead you use something called style sheets um and i'll go into detail in the next slide um another thing that's interesting to note is you now have to import each component that you use from react native explicitly it's not like you can just do import star from react you have to really import each piece and because css is no longer available now you have things for layout like flexbox you have to use libraries like navigator and animated library um because yes it's just not used in react native um so one thing that's the same from react is uh props and state and i thought we would just go through this because this is something that we did add in our react native app so props is short for properties um and they're used to pass data between react components so this these were also used in our original react app but we added additional ones for react native um so in this case um you can kind of think of them like parameters that are passed into a constructor so whenever you create let's say a to-do list item um because this is from the to-do list you'll have to pass in to do complete rest to do and the delete residue properties in comparison state allows components to create and manage their own data so unlike props you can't pass that past data with state but you can create data and manage it within your component um so in this case we used state to manage the state of the checkbox to make things um you know the ui work really quickly um so setting the state and then communicating that back to the database um so here's a little more detail on css versus style sheets so above in the image here you can see how css looks versus how style sheets look so what we did is we had originally in our original app we had a long index.css file and we had to take each of those pieces and convert them over into each component file um so the syntax is quite different um there are no classes in css in style sheets um and the styling for each component is typically done using the styles attribute so you can see here class name versus styles.complete in style style sheets use camel case descriptive values need to be in quotes or brackets depending on where you're putting it and you need a comma at the end of each one instead of a semicolon because in css it's json um certain attributes have parallels from css to react native um so you frequently need to like read through the documentation to find the one that's right most of the time they're like pretty similar but sometimes um you need to find something that sounds the same try it out test it find some examples and then you'll be able to figure out uh the right parallel for that particular property um now in react native for import statements you still need to import react it's not like you just convert over to react native and now you don't need react anymore so you add the component-based imports like i stated before and then if you add any additional libraries or features or properties you have to import those specifically as well okay david back to you all righty so all right uh let me go ahead and grab the screen and boop there we go magic all right so at this point i did see some folks say that they got through step three so there's a real key thing here in step three so if you remember what we did i'm just gonna go back through it and this is again to deploy our site up to our production like cdns and and you know this is for the site itself so we actually we don't have to have any servers or install it on our own web servers or anything that's that's what netlify is doing for us and by the way i did see a question you know somebody pointed out hey if i'm like a beginner to react then is this going to be useful for me here's what i really suggest and i'll go ahead and put it in there again at the very very top of this repo you'll see this little section right here if you're not and i'll just put the link in here as well this is if you are um not as familiar if you're not familiar with react you've never done this before i highly suggest maybe start for i'm typing on type talking for react start here i'm putting that in the chat maybe start here okay this will bring you on the react journey and then you can do this one as a follow-on you can still follow with us today no reason why not to if you follow the instructions it should work um but that way if you are new to react you have somewhere to start okay so we deployed our site um i'm you know i'm following the instructions here we went to uh well it already did our site deploy so we'll get a screen like this i'm gonna click on this first deployment and you see you should hopefully get to a point where it's fully built the site and you see this site is live right now once you've done that good your site is live just like it says what you want to do next though is all the way at the top you're going to see you have your specific site right it auto-generates these site names click on that now this next step is really really key because you need to be working out of your repository not our data stacks devs repository for the next section there's a couple different ways you can do this but for one you see this deploys from github right so i'm going to open that in a new tab and notice this is the same this is the same repo but notice it's at my it's in my github right that's really important so you want to go to the site that was generated for you and what's really cool about this netlife somebody asked earlier do i need to fork it no netlify does this for you right it actually copies over the repository now this repository is not only in my account but netlify is hooked up so now anytime i make any changes to my main or my master branch or whatever it will automatically get deployed to nutify so this is part of that whole infrastructure that's really cool so again this is really important that you go to the site this github link that was created in netlify once your site is built and that you're in yours and just bring yourself back down to the instructions because you're going to follow the rest of the instructions from your site all right so the next we're going to go to number four but i want to stop and see um how many you are with me at step four on your site can you give me a thumbs up yeah because i would hate i would hate for all of you to start the gitpod stuff and be in the other repository thank you storymandian i see a thumbs up from stormy indian let's see cool i'm seeing some come through excellent yes because we want to go to step four here wonderful okay hey there annika i'm in step four hey harsh wonderful yeah as long as you're in your own site you can move on wonderful okay i'm seeing a good amount of thumbs up so we'll go ahead and move on to the git power portion so once you are in your own repository like you see i'm in mine now you can use this opening git pod button now something to point out this gitpod button works with chrome and firefox i've actually noticed it's starting to work with brave i don't know if they made some updates recently but if you're in other browsers like safari um you may notice it'll say like i don't know what workspace you're talking about that is all explained down here in this section right so really this button is a shortcut it uses this skip pod this from referrer and that will launch the getpod ide linked to your repository but again if you're not using chrome or firefox you might get what looks like an error so just make sure to follow the instructions right here it'll tell you what you need to do all right but this should launch the ide in your browser this is vs code by the way um if you're not familiar with gitpod or if you've not used it in a while or something like that they were using it was fail for a while and they recently switched over and added a vs code so this is the vs code just like you would use locally the difference though is it is deployed up in the cloud and you don't need the local resources on your machine really to use it now you'll notice and i should i'll zoom this one because i know this one gets pretty small um you should see something like this in the terminal you're going to see all of these npm install commands what's going on here so this is something nice with git pod and it's actually one reason why we use it um git pod has something called a git pod yaml and what it's going to do it's automatically going to install all of those libraries for you so the point why am i pointing this out because if you were doing this in your own app especially for the choices that we made using things like expo using rack native using you know some of the libraries to for some of the widgets then these are all the libraries that we have to install right so this is something you would be doing in your own project but we've done it here for you in gitpod and they're going to automatically load oh thanks karen i'm glad you think this is red all this whiteness is hurting in my eyes uh pedro are you talking about your vs code because you can change it to dark mode oh how do you get to dark mode page i want to say if you go to the hamburger menu up here oh can i remember where it is where is it god i haven't done it in a while is it preferences it was easy to find once now i'm gonna say it's easy to find and not find it um right uh is it in settings let's see it's in here somewhere if someone knows where dark mode is please say so i know it's in the settings somewhere i haven't changed it for a while um but yes you can set to dark mode all right all right oh is it in preferences jesus thank you i see you guys working through it thanks patreon yeah all right so now we're going to let this part bake right now again if you think about it if you were doing this on your own you would have to you know it's npm it's going to download the world we know that um but you would actually have to go through all of this so we're just doing it all in one big lump sum that's what we're paying for right now while github loads so if you get to the point here where gitpod is loading these give us a thumbs up and then we're going to go into the next section of content while we let this bake as well i know i like midnight lizard too i think that's great it looks like sachin found it setting color themes all right so the hamburger medium file settings setting setting setting settings settings and color theme do i need to search for it yeah if i said no color theme oh there it is okay i searched for color while i was in settings and there you go yeah cool thank you session all right all right so we're gonna let this go i see some thumbs up coming in yes karen yeah there are lots of customizations in here that's for sure stormy indian great thank you and again we're not waiting for all of the libraries to finish if you've loaded gitpod and the ide and you have the libraries loading at any point then we're good to move on for now mine just finished actually so there you go cool and the last thing to do the last thing to do is this command right here this git remote dash v why because i want to double check before you move on that you actually are in the correct repository let me assume that one a little bit more notice that it's in my repository not data stacks debs so please do this step because if you're in data sex devs you're going to have to go back and do the nullify step again and i want to catch it before we get all the way down through things yep that's you know um shallow swire yeah if your git pod is still loading it it takes a moment right all right well while everybody's get pods are still loading why don't we go back over to sonia and let's talk about the next section what do you think sounds great is there anything you want to address or any questions or anything you saw while i was chatting there i've been chatting back to everyone in the chat exactly so okay everything's pretty good to go and of course if there any others feel free to bring them to my attention wonderful all right it's all you okay so in this section we're going to cover the configuration of your app that you're seeing going on in the git pod right now um so it'll run properly um so to start off with um the netlify.tomo file is a configuration file that specifies how netlify builds and deploys your site including redirects branch context specific settings and more um and so one of the things that we had to do was configure that to work with expo since expo has different build commands for each platform um and also expects a different folder name um this was actually spoiler alert one of the things that was causing us an issue for a while and then we went through the documentation again and realized that expo expected web build so you know our job here is really to just kind of remove some of the hiccups that we went through when you're working on converting this and getting all the platforms to work together and pointing out those issues so that when you're going through it you don't find that to be a random bug that you can't figure out another thing that we had to do and you can see this below right here is in the dot env file so our environment variables file we had to make sure that all the ips and ports were matching so they were expecting the right thing on either end um so that exponential git pod um and and all our three emulators ios android and let's say your browser chrome for example um we're all connecting um [Music] locally that meant programming in your inserting in your actual ip um on git pod was using your workspace url um on netlify it's something slightly different so while we're all waiting for our gitpod workspaces to get set up um it might be useful to just go through all the things that are getting um installed right now um so to start off with as you can see we install node um and then we install two command line interfaces so one for expo and one for netlify um we also install astra setup so that allows you to create your env file um during the workshop we also have ngrok here um and that's for using a tunnel in gitpod so that we can use um the cloud-based id pod um and then we also have a couple libraries for new mobile gestures and features that we didn't have in the additional original react app so that includes a gesture handler to enable swiping gestures and then a segmented control which is at the top of the to-do list and we'll show you that again at the end a couple other things that we added are custom fonts so we just used inter just for simplicity but you can use any custom google font that you have and then we also added a plug-in for using our environment variables inline in our files so that was using babel so that we could switch environments easily and switch our api calls accordingly um so to configure the endpoints right here um in our api.js file if you want to go look at this in the code in the in the repo what you can see is our original call so it was originally very simple just for web app going to the functions folder netflix but when we were doing this locally or on git pod or on netlify we needed a slightly different configuration so we added another function here called generate endpoint to customize that um so if you're doing it locally you need to take the your actual ip address and put in the same port across the platforms if you're running on git pod you set that variable to be true and then if you're running on netlify you set that to be true so depending on what we're running at the time we swap our environment variables accordingly so we added that configuration so that um we wouldn't have a challenge um having making ends meet no pun intended um and um another thing that we added here is exactly what we did to add in inline.env so that we can do exactly this call process.enbd.com access those environment variables in line in our code okay david yes yes all righty so you know i see a question that just came in by the way i just want to answer this one pablo asked is astra open source no astra itself is not open source but it's it's built on apache cassandra which is we're the company behind the patrick cassandra um also a lot of the pieces that astra has built on the kubernetes plane uh kate sandra is completely open-sourced the apis uh that are already there uh with regard to things like rest the document api graphql the grpc you know the kafka stuff that's all part of stargate.io which is also open source the drivers are open sourced i mean the vast majority of the stuff that goes around astra is all open source but astra itself is not open sourced um yeah jesse here here here you go feel free to reach out to me um discord is also a good place to go if you need to there you go all right so i should probably switch the screen back all right hopefully you are all somewhere like here where we have git pod it has loaded up um and it is it is finished essentially downloading the world right it's finished installing all those libraries okay so hopefully you're with me so what we're going to do and and by the way that was that was step 4b where we did that the next thing we want to do this is just a check right we want to check now here's the thing if you did this in nip in gitpod your node and npm versions should be the right versions right that that totally should be there now for those of you who are more advanced if you chose to do this locally and you want to try your hat at this in your own local environment you're going to want to definitely do these to make sure you have the right node and npm versions because there are minimum requirements that we have so we're going to do that here in a moment but the first thing i want to do is notice this little widget it's here in the instruction i want to split my terminal because we're going to need both in a moment i'm actually going to let me open this a little bit there we go so we're going to need both a moment so i'm just going to split again that icon is the one over here it looks like a little book i'm just going to split my terminal so i have two of these and you'll see you have two and then i'm just going to check my versions again it should be good we want to be at least npm 7 and node 15. okay wonderful i'm at 7 and 16. great now i shouldn't really need to do this next thing again it's if if they're not updated i'm just going to do it just because um but if for some reason you don't have the latest version of note or if you're not above 15 that you want to use that um in my case in most of your cases they'll say hey you're already good right and then we'll move on to step six yeah gonza as far as like mongodb um you know like it depends on what you're doing honestly from the data layer is known very well from the document database standpoint it's another nosql database just like cassandra is um the difference though is that is pretty much for documents it doesn't scale quite the same way that cassandra can uh and it does have like a master slave a leader follower kind of um topology where cassandra doesn't right cassandra is known it can scale much much you know much much better that's not the word i want to use it scales better but no it can is cassandra is known to be able to scale whether it's a handful of nodes or thousands of nodes and can handle cases like you know apple uh uh you know apple and siri and netlifer on netflix with like tens of millions of operations a second kind of thing um so it really it just depends it depends what you're after the cool thing is that in astra and stargate you do have a document uh database there so you can actually store native json objects but that's getting kind of out of scope and everything okay so let's move on to step six now this is where when you're using expo you do need to register with them so and again it's free so there shouldn't be any kind of cost or anything like that if you've not done that before go ahead and either click the link now if you put expo register here you're going to put these in the terminal it will actually launch you're going to see it's going to launch the simple browser now what you're going to find is that expo uh does not like it doesn't seem to like the gitpod browser uh the simple browser from gitpod so it's going to say hey refuse to connect so you can either just click the link here or in the simple browser up here you can click this to launch a new tab that will then bring up so anytime you ever see this you can always launch my my thing is obscured so that's why you see me looking around the camera you can always launch this into a new tab by clicking that button right so i've already registered for expo go through this step you should get to a screen that looks like this and this will get you going with expo all right then the next thing you want to do is i want to log in right because we need to essentially ensure that our workspace here is logged into expo so i'm going to log in this is going to use the account that you just created there we go says okay i'm now logged in and do you really need the who am i step this is just us doing an extra check just to ensure that you are logged in with your account and just to make sure that that's all good and hooked up all right so once you've gotten to this point oh thanks pat i appreciate that once you've gotten to this point give us a thumbs up let us know that you're logged into expo and you're ready to go on and let's see i don't know if i'm in the data oh um bella if you don't know if you're in the data sex how do you do it that's that get remote so if i go back up here for you here i'll put the command in do this there you are do that command that get remote dash v will show you which repository you're in yeah totally harsh i'll repeat it alright so what i'm going to do again one of two things either i will just put expo register right in my terminal when i do that it's going to launch it into the the simple browser appear but again it doesn't like it so i'm just going to click the little widget you see in the top right that will launch it into a new tab that should bring me to the registration page for some reason that's not working for you the link is right here right you just go to expo.dev sign up and where you want to get to this is is you just want to get here in this page again you should not have to pay anything or whatever and then i want to say expo login okay so this is now going to log in it's going to link um my workspace to expo right now it says i'm already logged in am i going to log in as a user i'll say yes and i'm going to put in this is the same credentials i would have just registered with expo with and it should say okay you're not logged in you don't need the priority plan yeah sachin you don't need to do that yeah you can go with all the basic basic stuff all right i'm seeing some thumbs up come in and then that last step again for the who am i is just to double check i mean if you've logged in it should be fine we'd like to double check that way you have that extra little check in here and you should be at something that looks like this all right all right we'll give everybody just a moment okay good i see more i see more coming in cool i see some great questions too thank you rags for i see rags and ryan in there now for this next step this one's totally on your phone i can't really show this um this is really just going whether on an android device or an ios device or device whatever word i chose to say right there um and going you can see expo app and android and expo go in ios um to go and install those so if you don't want to do this step that's totally up to you this is the fun step though because i found doing this and being able to run an actual native mobile app in expo natively as compared to just through my browser was really cool so i really suggest doing this step again if you don't want to do it right now you don't have to um but it's fun so i'll give everybody a moment to go ahead and do this step step seven i see some thumbs up from karen ganza and wardo thank you and let us know when you've done step seven when you've installed video thank you all right all right i see more thumbs up rituan thank you rizwan sorry so here's what i want you to do yeah i see you're a little headcare and perfect yes the expo app when you when we finally launch this thing it's going to give you a qr code that you can just scan and then it launches the app local globally or locally it's really cool yeah so when we're using when we're using expo it's going to use the expo app or the expo go app depending on what uh platform you're on to actually run the native app yes no roshawn now you can um i mean you're here but really to be done if you want to get the badge go through you'll see there's a homework section at the top of the repo just go through the content show us your deployed app and and submit it it's all in the homework section i'm glad you think so richie i i actually think this is this is fun the expo stuff is really neat actually so pablo great question let me say this one out loud and sonia i'll be curious to see if you have any thoughts on this um he says okay this app runs over the expo platform in general to run a react app on mobile do you have to use expo no you do not have to use expo it is the choice that we made because we specifically in running the workshop we need to make sure it's accessible to everybody and when we are comparing flutter and expo the big difference is that with flutter i still need to download all of the the development tools things like xcode i have to download android studio it's like all together i think we're talking like 20 gigabytes worth of stuff right so we chose a platform that we could use where we could do it all up in the cloud and and have everybody be able to do it with us so that was kind of one of the key pieces from that standpoint but you do not have to use expo if you're doing rack native it's not a requirement we're going to do that in a minute harsh um sonia did you have anything else uh that you wanted to mention as far as the the expo thing or no that's exactly right um expo just enables you to see your app really quickly on your phone um you get to that you know wow moment so quickly because you you start setting up an app and you can see it on your phone right away as opposed to spending an hour downloading xcode you know downloading android studio going in there and configuring the simulators instead you just use your mobile device as your simulator it's very rewarding so it's also convenient for a cloud-based workshop so yeah exactly harsh is that 84 megabytes is that for the expo app that is definitely significantly smaller than the many gigabytes when we were first you know when we first decided to do a workshop on this and we were kind of evaluating what direction we were going to go um once you know that that kind of was the deciding factor uh when we had almost 20 gigabytes of stuff we had to download otherwise all right here's what i'd like to do before we go to this section here i know some of you were having a hard time creating the database right um so i want to make sure we're good from that standpoint so here's what i'd like you to do not only that we never created our tokens so let's go back up i want you to go back up to step one and we're gonna go back to create our database if you hadn't done this before because we not only need the database to hook it up but we're going to need that token to create in a second for it to authenticate so i'm going to go back to this step if you weren't able to do this before i'm going to go ahead and our little problem there was fixed should be fixed so i'm going to do the same thing before i'm going to put in the database name in the key space i'm going to pick my region and my provider again just something close to you and then say create database oh is it still giving you the error now pedro hmm you know pedro do me a favor log out and log back in let me know if it's still doing it it's saying mertz what what issue are you having are you still having an issue where it won't let you do it at all oh oh interesting this it worked for me a moment ago and now i'm seeing it again myself well that's unfortunate okay all right got it okay okay i'll let them know yeah we ran into some interesting issue and i know that the team is working it you know i'm gonna try something i'm i'm curious i'm gonna see if this works because the funny thing about it is i know that the issue is actually with the front end not the back end so i'm gonna try something and if this works for me it might also work for you uh so give me just a moment let's see now you need a token and you may not be able to do that part but we'll find out just a second okay i have an idea i okay okay i have an idea so for those of you who are having an issue let's see if you can create a token um when you are first if you're in the dashboard i don't know if this is going to work just yet um you want to click actually let me do it first let's make sure that same front-end issue isn't going to cause an issue here okay so far so good yes i'm gonna go back over this so don't worry perfect okay here's what i'd like you to do if for some reason you had an issue creating your database right then from your dashboard go to current organization this drop down on the top left click that go to organization settings now notice i went to a different tab right so i middle clicked it or i say open link a new tab right so i'm suggesting to do that because you're going to want this later like i did here then go to token management pick database administrator and then generate token i wonder how many you had carl if you had more than five or something like that okay all right now what i'd like you to do is get to a point where you're here where you have your you have your token cool i see pedro wonderful so this token this is the one we want the one that says token so i want to copy that in my buffer you can click the little widget here or just copy it you should by the way also download the token details you always want to do that but while we're here you can just copy that token in your buffer then here's what we're going to do oh i just leave this window open because we're going to need to come back and copy it go back to get pod and down at step eight i'm gonna we're gonna try this together and see if this will work better there's this command at step eight this mpm exec astro setup to do native workshop to do's copy this put it into your terminal it's going to ask you for that token so what i want to do is i want to come back over here get the token i'm just going to paste it okay and hopefully you get a message like this it'll create it'll try to create the database yeah thank you yeah thanks rags for that yeah the the token instructions i can do it again no problem the token instructions are also um in the repo yep we'll do it i'll do it again all right let's do it again so again if you had a problem for those of you who created your database you should be good from that standpoint i'm doing this as a way uh to kind of go through the back end here to create the database if you had an issue um so again we want to go to current organization the top left i'm going to click that drop down go to organization settings now i'm going to open this in a new tab right i want to open that a new tab because i want to use it later you should see a page like this go to token management oh thank you very i'm glad that you uh feel that way okay it seems like a couple of you are still getting still having issues okay okay well i appreciate your patience with that um so again we'll go to token management choose database administrator then click generate token once you do that you'll see a page that looks like this and then don't forget to download your token details this is how you authenticate um oh is it not are we saying it's not creating the new database if it wasn't already there is that what i'm seeing regs got it okay it looks like some of you are still getting 504s okay um for those of you who have data yeah unfortunately we'll have to move on and i know that the team is working on what's going on there um so what we will do is we'll we'll move on and unfortunately for those of you who can't create the database just yet i'm sorry about that what we can do though is the good thing is you can always go back later and do this um we'll have to see what's going on yes karen oh oh you you you start it with astra cs you do use the aster cs in your token yes okay so for those of you who have your database and you were able to run the astra setup command so we're now back at eight right you should see something that kind of looks like this what that would do what that would have done was generate a dot env file so i'm going to open that up and let me move this over okay and let me and that's actually going to generate this file for us so we don't have to type all this stuff out right and you'll notice here's the token right this is how i'm going to authenticate it's telling me where my database is all that kind of fun stuff now the next thing we want to do is go to the step 8c i want to run this special script we wrote and all this does this this host url sh it just added notice the ones that are highlighted it just added some other environment variables what are we doing here you remember before when sonia talked about some of the complexities that we ran into when running a native mobile environment right namely that for one android and ios are looking for different networks for you know for each even in the emulators and such not only that we have this distinction between whether or not are we running on the local environments are we running a git pod that has a completely different endpoint which is this right or are we running up in netlifying production and so depending on what environment we're in that's where we have these these booleans uh you know where we're saying are you in prod are you in gitpod because there's some conditional code that's what sanji was showing you earlier that's essentially saying hey what environment are you on so we can so the end points are configured properly right there may be some you may have some other ways to do this this is the way that we chose but that's where this is coming from so make sure that you're at the end of the day once you're done with running this step at 8c bash host url.sh that you see all of these environment variables and these four on the end oh hearts once you generate the new token download the token and then you can go to step if you haven't done it already go to step 8 b set up and you want to run the astra setup command we skipped around a little bit because we were having some problems with the back end um in astra and that's i'm sorry about that yeah so we're done we're at 8b and okay yep i see it pablo thank you yeah i'm while we're talking i'm actually talking to the team in the back end as well to make sure that they're aware so i appreciate that so uh we are at eight down at 8b once you have your token run this aster setup command in your gitpod terminal once that is done then run the bashposturl.sh at the end you should see an environment and env file that looks kind of like this once you get here if you've gotten here give us a thumbs up let us know you're here oh yay pedro i know that that while we're talking they are literally like uh it looks like there was a back end service that kind of went belly up and they were literally fixing it as we were doing it so there's a chance that for some of you who are having a challenging time with the database it'll it'll start working soon okay and now the token is the same um the token the token should be the token that you have from when you generated it it looked like it'll be down here i'm not sure what you meant pedro and now the tokens is the same maybe you could read let me state that all right so now we're almost there we're so close we're so close all right so once you've gotten to the point where you've got your environment variable your dot or i'm sorry your dot env and your environment variables and your dot env now we want to actually start the app yes pedro that's it yeah now i understand okay oh vanessa looks our um venezuela looks like is a head juan what part is not working yet is it the database part or something else okay so okay let's see so what we're going to do now is i've got my env file i have all my values now i'm going to go ahead and do netlify dev now i want to point something out that we're doing here um when using expo expo separate from the app that is by default the web app would run at 888 that port 8888 but expo uses lots of ports in the 19000 range so you're going to notice that we have this little semicolon gp preview gpurl8888 like what is that about what we're telling the preview pane in gitpod to do is to run at the 8888 endpoint but as you notice it's an order operation thing it doesn't always work like that right so look what i'm doing notice that i just changed my port up here i just changed it to 888 right that's what you want you want to use 888. so if if if it generates one that's like in the 19000 range make sure you change that yeah uh to how when you do this on your own yeah you follow the instructions stepwise um if you want to clear your terminal harsh you can just say clear yeah you can literally type clear in the terminal all right so hopefully you have a to-do list over here and then once you've gotten to that point again by the way if if it didn't launch an 888 for you and you're not familiar with how to do that this next command here right there this gp preview right here just run that one that will launch 888 for you cool pedro then here's the last little piece this is the fun part so i'm going to do export start dash dash tunnel notice i'm going to put this in the other terminal right that's why we had you created that's why we had you split the screen this one is the app this one is going to be for the expo piece now if you get this message it says hey i'm already using port 19000 something do you want to use another port just say yes it's totally fine that's also the instruction here and then here's where this gets fun all right so i got to move this up a little bit you're going to get this nice qr code you could theoretically i i wonder sonia i bet you people could scan mine couldn't they you want to test that's on you i'm curious if you scanned my phone i think we had tried it yeah and it worked yes yeah so if you want if you're curious and you downloaded expo oh jay i got it whoo that's cool oh we're always recording don't worry jibber yeah yeah we're always recording all right so you scan the qr code you'll see it's loading down here right it's going to have to it's going to bundle it up it's actually doing a bunch of optimizations and stuff um but then at the end you should once it if you've loaded expo go um then it will automatically when you scan that with your phone it'll automatically load the app and expo go and then after just a moment um here you can use my qr code why not let's let's give it a go if you're having a hard time with your app you can use my qr code i can only imagine to see what to do's everyone puts in yeah you can definitely see it yeah cool yeah so if you so if you are if you did have a hard time like with the database or something like that scan my qr code and if you loaded expo go on your app on your phone then it should load and i'm seeing requests come in so i know you're all in there that's what's so that's what you're seeing here on the left-hand side that you're all doing it so pedro show's invalid token where are you seeing that harsh make sure you copy the astra cs part of part of it so the astral cs part here this whole thing is part of the token so make sure you have that in there okay oh that's funny to howl i just realized that i guess you could technically screenshot mine and submit it i won't know the difference actually i will know the difference because i'll know it's my to-do's awesome all right i see some folks have gotten there great now of course the goal is to do it with your own phone this is my app uh and to do it with your own app and everything like that oh god what are you guys putting in here should i even should i even look at this am i gonna be afraid these are just getting deleted as far as i can see oh really see what's going on oh okay okay yeah i see that right okay cool all right how looks like going mertz were you ever real ever able to get your um database up and running and stuff yeah karen the expo thing's pretty cool so something i really want to point out for those of you who have the app loaded and you're working with and everything when you're running it through expo notice you can tap or you can swipe right um the controls are built more for a native mobile experience not so much of a web app right um matter of fact the way that this was built i would i can interact with it like i would a web app wow oh look at all those come in that's awesome that's funny or i can swipe right you'll see on the phone i can swipe and and such so there's different you know that's obviously not something i might you could build that on uh like a regular web app or something like that um but the native components have more of a native feel and everything so you can really create an app that looks and feels native but you're doing it in react native instead of having to do it in swift and do it in java and then do it in a web app is as well right so it makes a big difference well there's a lot coming in that's awesome you know i don't know valeen if expo has limit connections i'm not sure oh um omkar the app is not built to automatically refresh an update are you talking about in your app or are you talking about in the app that everyone's adding uh to use my app all right all right wonderful okay so i think you i think a lot of you were able to get to the point where you have the app running i see a ton of to-do's coming in um i think that's wonderful now if you weren't able to uh create your own um that'll you know that'll probably be more part of the homework and stuff um but yeah you should see a page that looks like this scan the qr code that's what we've done and viewing it we're at that last piece all right all right so if you've gotten to a point where you have this running in your device through expo go give us a thumbs up let us know that you've got it going oh totally isaac you know um if you feel so inclined and you want to do a pull request go for it why not like i mean any you know we like to evolve the content and the code and stuff that's in these um you'll find that like for something like the to do app we didn't put in a lot of extra logic on top of what you're doing to do's because it's really meant to be a beginner app to help introduce people to how to you know how to do things so we try to remove a lot of the stuff we might do in a full-fledged app um but hey i'm i'm totally up for new capabilities oh should i go back and see the i see the ideas are showing oh i like oh someone for an icon oh that's cool i wonder if that's an emoji i didn't know you could actually do that that's pretty awesome all right i see carl manuel bruce yeah harsh when you do the netlify dev thing it's it's not so much installing it's just loading up the app um and you're gonna see a bunch of dev output and everything that's normal yeah um pragya i am checking into that right now i know that a lot of folks were able to move on uh the issues mostly should have been fixed but it seems like summer you were still still having issues i'd say give it another shot let me know yay karen good okay yeah i know that they have to roll through um the fix so it may just been that not everybody had the fix at the same exact time okay all right so let's see sonya i think while we're doing this we've got just a little bit more content to get through okay pablo i see uh harsh what went wrong when you say something went wrong in the message something went wrong message and app if you can give a little more detail there and we'll we'll follow up so sonia yeah let's go ahead and go into the rest of the content i feel like we have some native controls we need to talk about we do all right so let me know when you're ready and there we go all right so so all of you guys can not hopefully whichever ones of you have been able to get it working in expo um we also you can also see that we've added a couple native features that we haven't gone over yet um and these allow us to have a more mobile friendly experience and also accept some of the gestures that we're totally used to um so as you can see we added swipeable gestures so i don't know about you but i'm always in my email inbox okay mark is red mark is red mark is right striving to hit inbox zero so we wanted to add that to this app so that you could do the intuitive gesture of like okay this i am done with this i can delete it or i can mark this as done or mark it as not done actually um and so you can swipe from either end so you can swipe from the right side to delete you can swipe all the way off from the left side you can also swipe all the way off to mark as complete or mark as incomplete depending on the status so it'll swap back and forth the way we implemented this is we used refs which is a react principle to make the to do item close itself so that we could use um an inbuilt function from the swipeable library um so that once the gesture is finished or it's released prematurely the the to do item closes so you can see here i've pictured what it looks like to mark an item complete let's say you're going to swipe an item that's already checked it would show incomplete below so you're marking it incomplete um alternatively you can also click the check box or click the delete trash can icon um another feature that we added is in the original app we had um a filter at the bottom of the to-do list well the only challenge with that on mobile is like let's say you add too many to two items now the filter has gone past the end of the page and you don't even actually know the filter is there so we decided to add a segmented control instead um so just like i'm i'm pretty sure this must be an android too in some in some cases but we added something called a segmented control and you can actually see this on ios if you have an iphone but that on the top of the calls list you can filter your calls based on missed and um receipt and all i believe um so what we did at the top of the to-do list is we added a filter for all to-do items active ones the ones that aren't checked yet and completed which are the ones that are checked and one of the last things we did is we obviously changed up the ui quite a bit so in this case what you can see here in the image is the status bar so this is what's at the top of your mobile phone at the top shows the time you know connection to the network etc on the top left you can see an iphone um iphone status bar ios does not let you actually customize the status bar whereas in the bottom right you can see that android does so the background cover color extends all the way to the top in android but doesn't do that in ios and it's just a platform specific thing um and so you kind of have to work around that um a couple other things that we had to add um was was the property flex wrap so originally when we were building this um we realized that if you had a very long to do item on certain platforms the text would wrap properly um on android it would overflow so you had to specify flex wrap to set the dimensions for how much it would wrap left and right um and extend the to-do item as well so programming the height of a to-do item was not a good idea because it wouldn't responsibly expand depending on how long your to-do item was um another thing that we added was and we noted was um when we were building i would have the ios simulator up the android simulator up as well as a web app up and what that allows you to do is as you're building and you refresh each platform you add new new pieces of code you can see how that code interacts with each platform that allows you to find platform specific bugs as you're building which is super helpful because you don't want to just build on android for example and then two hours later once you've added like you know 40 different lines of code now you look at your app and you realize on ios it looks totally different or something's wrong so it's really just best practice to have a lot of them up so you can keep checking um so one of those platform specific bugs that a great example is on web when you selected the text input so where you go in to write in a new to-do oftentimes that box would be highlighted in blue when you were typing on there well it just kind of looked a little weird and kind of didn't look intentional so we had to figure out how to remove that so that's another ui enhancement that we added another one that we did was custom fonts so you can choose any google font because the great part about google fonts is then they're applicable on web on ios and android um so we cust we brought in inter so that we could have the same font across platforms um and another thing just just as an advice just some takeaways from our experience building is like i said before platform-specific bugs um do crop up because sometimes native behavior is different between the platforms different operating systems so it's really helpful to keep all emulators open while you're building sometimes i just load on your machine a little bit but it really helps you just when you get to the end of the app building process and you're super happy that your app works you don't want to get like an unwelcome surprise that now it doesn't work on android for whatever reason um it just helps you move things through quickly another thing to keep in mind is sometimes when you're installing additional libraries you'll get this issue called peer dependency errors and i'll keep coming up sometimes you can resolve those manually because they're looking for a particular version number in your package.json so go through that and look look at that and you can look up how to configure that to make those go away another way to get around that is using the legacy pure dependency flag and i did find that that sometimes um helped us get around some of those issues brought up by npm 7. um another thing to keep in mind is react native itself and expo adds additional features does not have all of the con like components you may want to use um for example the segmented control does not exist within the core react native library or expo um and there is a whole directory of different expansions that people have built um and you can go and look that up and i've linked that in the repository in the blog as well and you can look up what you need so for example there is no check box in expo or react native so i had to find a check box in a different ui library import that and use that and those libraries are often times really great and the great way to evaluate those is see how much involvement there is um how many forks there are or people actually uh commenting on the repo and then you can figure out how um when it's most recently been updated things like that so you know what you're using it's going to be continued to be supported um another thing to use and i'm sure is just a normal uh normal thing that developers do but it's worth mentioning is search for solutions online a lot of times sometimes you'll end up with a weird error and it'll sound odd and you won't be able to like just google that specific error and you will find people who have faced the same issue and they'll have interesting really interesting solutions and workarounds for it a lot of times when i faced that it was a great way to get around those um and the last thing is you know in addition to the mobile apps you can also create a progressive web app and i've linked that quick blog post and you can create that in under five minutes okay david back to you all right you know interestingly enough sonia um renan uh over in youtube actually has one of the promise rejection errors which i'm really surprised to see so i'm asking yeah we're where they're seeing that um yeah i'm not surprised let me let me i'm very well accustomed to those let me go yeah yeah exactly no you're not alone you're not alone we we went through all those and so that's why i'm actually surprised to see it all right so let's see yeah laporta there are you know um if you're just learning javascript um you know if you're not a fan of the syntax um it is popular you know like i would say it's a really good idea to start with some of the frameworks uh things like you know react to vue or whatever um as a matter of fact though if you are just learning js let me give you something um it is in fact the other repo that is linked at the very top of this one um and in here matter of fact i'm going to open this up for you and we're going to get into the game here in just a moment okay so we're going to do the swag quiz real quick um and then we'll close out so i'm going to give you two repos and the other one i think is at the bottom because for those here it is here it is here it is yes so if you're new to javascript and you're new to react um where are you let's see where'd you go where'd you go where'd you go ah laporte there you go here we go so start with that repo again this is all done on this is all free and everything now by the way there are a ton of um youtube influencers and resources out there and rec the react site itself is actually really good uh you know from explaining everything and kind of oh my god did you see all these emojis oh i almost don't want to see what that has done oh that's awesome whoever did that one that that will be forever immortalized that's wonderful anyway so um uh so so yeah laporte yeah take a look there first right um the frameworks really help a lot with the the syntax and everything and they make it a much nicer experience and everything all right so we are right about time where we need to get to our fun swag quiz so let's do it hope you guys i know sun you can't hear my music but we're gonna rock out so i can walk out dance out you should hopefully have like a little disco right we gotta let this go uh make sure to use that qr code there or go to mentee.com and put in the code you see at the bottom that four nine seven seven seven two five three you think i'm kidding i'm not kidding ganzo i'll i'll check out your um your issue there in a minute all right let's see how many of you were here with us yeah give us a thumbs up let us know you're here so we can know how many of us are in here so we can do our swag quiz our top three winners we'll get some swag we'll be able to win some swag see how we're doing all right i'll wait just another minute to let folks get in again there's a qr code or go to mente.com at 4977 725 oh you get intro to cassandra where are you seeing that um [Music] where are i have you know um omkar and bruce yeah thank you sonya that's a good idea yeah if you somehow we're getting to a different uh mentee then restart that yes well that's very interesting well here let me um i don't know why this would be intro to cassandra let's see what happens here this definitely wasn't intro to cassandra all right now a key thing when when we start the quiz you know maybe maybe when we created the new mentee i didn't rename something that could be what that is so sorry for confusion there but no you're in the you should be in the right place um when we start the quiz here's the key thing is that look at your phone look at wherever you're running minty if you listen to us there might be lag in the video and speed matters when you answer okay all righty all right let's go ahead and do the first one because i see we have a lot of folks in again look at your phones what is astra we mentioned it very briefly it's a development tool it's a local in-memory version of cassandra it's cassandra as a service in the cloud it's a gateway to the stars all right let's see what happens here all right yes it is cassandra as a service in the cloud that is that data layer that back end data layer that's where we were creating the database let's see what our leaderboard looks like good i'm seeing a lot of very familiar names pragya mukesh all right and the top answer there was val's with the fastest answer then jon snow oh we have jon snow here i don't know what that portends but that's that's okay i like john snow i like johnson and then venmel in third karen do you still just have the name prop there should have that's awesome all right moving on to the next question and i was referring to bruce there that's funny question two of four here we go what tools are required to launch native apps with expogo xcode for ios android studio both xcode xcode and android studio are none just expo go correct none just expo go right now it doesn't mean you can't use xcode and android to do some work and stuff like that but it just means they're not required for you to launch apps with expo go very good harsh re refresh your refresh the browser that you're running um oh sorry laporta i know that that could be frustrating i mean we we do this with thousands of people at times and i know minty does its thing but every once in a while um sometimes um sometimes you need refresher or whatever all right so in top veils then pragya was the fastest time takes number two jon snow holding out number three but we know that jon snow has to die and then come back so we'll see what happens jon snow um gerardo what stack is xcode used that is for ios that's ios and swift okay next question question three of four hopefully some of you were having a problem with um mentee it is working again oh you're getting up there come on karen how do you style html with react native using css files with a styles file using style sheets defined in code with moxie i don't know i hope someone got that joke i'm gonna start with moxie right right is that a bad one sonia do i need to no i like that one it was all right so the correct answer yeah this one may have seemed subtle but it's something that some you talked about earlier you use style sheets that are defining code so if you're used to doing things with normal web apps and using css files which we've been doing for a long long time um then you don't do them anymore you actually use style sheets to find in your code that's one of the big big differences here all right let's see what happened to our leaderboard what's more feeling oh valence takes the lead fastest time pragya number two and bala and third let's see what happens here this is our last question for all the marbles with more feelings ah karen that's funny in react native how do you define a div view a div tag lowercase dip tag or the great divide oh seventh karen let's see what happens you never know could have just taken the lead this one is also very subtle i'm sorry for being tricky all right so the correct answer here so the divs where red herring to throw you off um yeah you don't use the the normal html tags you actually use a view in this particular case um and the great divide i think you guys all got my joke so yes it's view and there's that slide on there and by the way you know again you're not relegated to just the slides which are in the workshop um as well they're actually in the repo you can get all those details but this stuff is like really well documented uh on the react native site and expo and stuff they talk about it at detail all right so let's see what happened to our leaderboard and let's see who takes it all right so pragya takes the lead richie and jay come up in second and third so if you're one of our top three winners pragya richie or jay i'm gonna leave this up take a screenshot so you have proof that you are one of the top three winners and you will send and i'll show you in a second you'll send an email to jack jack.fryerdatastax.com for our winner so congratulations to our winners thank you thank you thank you oh so close so close for lean and you were close too karen yeah yeah you know you bear you can just we we do swag quizzes every time right so you can uh take do another one yes winter is coming so again for those who won i will show a slide on this later if you're one of our top three winners email jack.fryer datastax.com to get your swag there you go all righty so with that let's go ahead and i will um move i there's a question we have for you at the end here and hopefully everyone got their uh their screen yeah honestly there's a lot of people there are a lot of people in these right so if you're in any like the top 10 or something you know tap 20 for for god's sakes yeah give yourself give yourself some credit all right so as we wrap up like i just mentioned a second ago if you were in the first second or third place there you know hopefully you grab that screenshot email jack.frayer datastacks.com with the screenshot of your mentee screen so you can get your swag um to holler they wouldn't there's a swag box uh it's changed recently we've been doing a lot of updating to our whole swag pipeline so i don't know exactly what items we have just yet um but it historically it's been like shirts uh metal cups and cool little trinkets and things like that um so i don't know if um uh if if jack or anybody is on they can tell you more about that but yeah there's there's just one swag there okay so i mentioned homework so in the repo if we go ahead and take a look at that i'm gonna laugh at this emoji thing a lot whoever did that by the way in the repo you'll see that there's a homework section here right you see this homework section so if you want to earn yourself a badge um what this means is that you've gone through the material you've completed it um to do that that all the instructions are in the homework there's a link at the end of the homework you just click that link it'll submit an issue to the github repository you just put your put your image there your screenshot there that's all you need to do obviously fill out your name and your email so we can give you a badge um and the cool thing about these badges is that they're verified badges that then you can put on the features section of like your linkedin profile you know you can you can put these all over and you'll find we have like a dozen of them from other workshops and everything so um they're kind of like you know you can use them to brag and and such like that now we have something else for you this is actually kind of um cool to check out if you haven't done it before look at that qr code that you see on the right hand side and make sure you scan that uh or go to the link you see there dts xo dt sx dot io slash workshops voucher why because this if you have not already done this um this you you fill this out um this will give you two attempts that are 145 each at getting your cassandra or kate sanders certifications right um so these are two free attempts that we're giving you that's a thank you for coming and doing the material and being with us and everything like that uh so again take advantage of that scan that qr code or go to the link that you see there on the page um and there are you know for each of these in academy and by the way academy.davidsax.com everything there is free all of our trainings and learnings are always free um and so if you're interested in learning more about cassandra or if you want to run cassandra and kubernetes um and that's what astrodb is powered on by the way um then you can go and take these paths and these paths will provide you with all the information you need to pass your certification exam so for those of you who are interested in doing that i highly recommend checking it
