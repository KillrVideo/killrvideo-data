    "text": "here workshop uh an easy back end for your application part of our cloud native cassandra series i'm david jones lardy i'm joined today by eric zitlow hey eric hello how you doing today david doing right doing right all right let's go ahead and make us a little smaller so hello everybody and um just to kind of give you a start into um what to expect so today um this is actually part of a multi a multi-episodic series if you will but we're starting with the first one an easy back end for your application so really we're going to focus on here today are the backend crud operations that you would need and use to work with a cassandra database now as we go into the other parts now by the way i just want to point out that each one of these right it's part of a series yes but you don't if you let's say you're not here today which you wouldn't know because you wouldn't be on here but let's say that you you didn't go to the second one and you're like oh but can i go to the third one totally each one of these is its own it's its own set of information you can go to each one individually we highly encourage you to check all these out make sure to register for each week um so in the second week uh we will be talking about connecting kubernetes and apache cassandra that's where we'll take an app deploy it in kubernetes and then hook that up to cassandra right and then in the third week we we take that we move it up a level and we actually deploy to the cloud and gke with kubernetes and cassandra again right so each one of them is going to have a different tidbit of information again today we're going to focus on just the back end application and the crud operations like how do you hook it up how do you then you know get all the plumbing going how do you get the crud operations going and what all that looks like yeah taking it one layer deeper every week yeah pretty much pretty much right okay then just some housekeeping right um so if you take a look over on the top left hand side you'll see our our youtube channel datasetsdevs now most of you are probably watching us right there so you probably already have that that's wonderful if you haven't already though subscribe click the bell that way you can get notifications when we have workshops going um if you've not been with us before you'll find that we usually have at least a workshop every week we have learning mondays we have all sorts of things that are going on so if you want to be able to keep up to date with what's what's going on there then you definitely want to go ahead and subscribe i should also mention uh for those of you who have been with us before you've gone to the youtube channel admittedly things were a little unorganized for a time uh pretty much all the videos from all the workshops that we had were just out there we have gone through we have um we've got new graphics we have reorganized everything the videos have been consolidated it should be a much easier experience now to find what you're looking for so if you haven't in a while go take another look now looking over at the top right hand corner there you'll see that data stacks dot io workshop that is going to be for our astra db now i was watching the chats earlier looks like a bunch of you are already registering and getting your databases going that's wonderful astrodb is going to be the cassandra database that we're going to use today what we're going to use today is a free tier right we're going to talk more about that in a second but it's a fully managed cassandra cluster it only takes a minute to spin it up so that's what we're going to use for our exercises today and you're not limited to just using it for what we're doing today you can use this for your applications um you know for whatever you're looking for as well on the bottom left-hand corner you'll see that bitly to cassandra workshop now that's bringing you to our discord channel some of you are already there chatting with us today and that's that's wonderful so i'm glad that you found that now you can chat with us on the youtube channel and that's perfectly fine we're actually going to maintain both right we're going to we're going to be trying to answer as many questions and interact with you through both youtube and discord the big difference though is that when the youtube stream stops the youtube chat stops if you want to be able to have say a more in-depth conversation you want to be able to talk to us after the fact that's where the discord channel comes in there's also something like 7 000 other folks in the cassandra community that are with us there in the discord channel so then you'll be kind of joining that community as well so again we encourage you to join our discord if you haven't already it's a great resource to use especially if you want to be able to talk to us after after the stream today absolutely all right so disclaimer this this is kind of a disclaimer not totally disclaimer um but this is really it is a coding session today now the really the disclaimer is this and i've already seen some questions about this um we are going to be using node.js and python for the code but if you're not familiar with any of these while it's good that you do have some familiarity you don't have to the exercises today i think they are for any any level at the beginner level um they're going to be pretty easy really what we're doing is we've implemented the crud code and stuff that you need right this is really going to be more of an exercise of running running certain operations and then being able to reference that for your own use later so let's say that you're node.js dev and you're like you know something i really want to know how i can use paging or how i can insert that's what this app is for it's perfect to then go oh okay here's here's this one class right in there i have everything i need a very nice small working example right of how to do whatever that particular operation is so we're providing this stuff for you that's really what i'm getting at so don't worry about the disclaimer so much um another piece is that all of the code that we're doing is through gitpod so you will need a github account for that if you want to do it locally you can but any kind of issues you run into it's kind of on you right we have preconfigured everything in gitpod and if you've not used gitpod yet for those of you using github you might have noticed that little git pod link that showed up like i want to say like the halfway through last year or something like that it is a wonderful free resource that gives you a cloud-based ide that you can just spin up right out of your code right you can share it with coworkers and everything we love it it's been a great resource for us what we've done is we have pre-configured everything and pre-loaded things like you know npm pip all that stuff has all been pre-loaded for you all you need to do is spin it up again that'll be in the exercises and you're good to go right so anyway we really encourage you all to use git pod you will need a github login for that i think most people do have that but otherwise you don't really have to install anything everything that we're gonna do will be provided for you up in the cloud awesome okay so with that um for the hands-on that we will have some hands-on today right if you haven't done this already um we should drop some links eric in this um yeah thank you are you doing it awesome yeah so the first one is going to be again i mentioned that datasacks.io workshop notice the qr code there on the top right you can just scan that with your phone it'll bring you to the registration for astra if you haven't done it yet and then on the bottom there you'll see the github repository that we are using today again we have the qr code and let me just go ahead and check okay i see some questions coming in and everything i'm just kind of making sure i'm up to date on all the stuff that's going on yep we should be good i've been watching it wonderful and eric's dropped the link there good okay excellent excellent one right now alrighty and let's do that all right with that let's go ahead and take a look at what we're going to talk about right um so in the two hours that we have so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to start off with our use case and the data model now we haven't really talked about the app that we're using today it's a spaceship app right so so the app is kind of really there to help you explore crud operations in the back end the front end of it and what it's doing i don't think is as important but what we're going to be working on we're just going to do the crud we're getting our hands dirty yeah yeah exactly um but the app itself what it's really doing is you know imagine you've created an app that's going to track spaceships on their journeys right so as a spaceship whether it's something from spacex or or nasa or whatever like it or whoever other company it launches um then for each spacecraft and that particular journey we want to record some information about that there's also sensor readings things like the speed the temperature pressure all sorts of things um so this app really is just designed to kind of visually show you um the data you know the types of information that's coming from the sensors and then storing that in the back end so we're going to use this use case and use that to generate our data model that we're then going to apply to our cassandra database with our schema then there we're going to connect up the app it's actually really really easy to do we'll show you how so we're going to hook up the plumbing and get the plumbing from the app going to your particular database and then the cred operations come into play if you're not familiar with crud right that's create read update delete those are just the basic set of operations that pretty much any application needs to do with its database so once we get to sections four and five we're going to start working with creating data updating record reading the results how do i parse them how do i page all that kind of thing okay so as we mentioned this is really more focused on the back end even though the app we're working with today does in fact have a front end and such we're not working with that part of it but i just wanted to show you what that looks like again you could tell that this part of it is really meant is just a demonstration platform to kind of demonstrate what's going on in the back end that's really what's happening but as you start a journey there are various sensors that are you know there's information being generated things like temperature speed pressure location all that data if you imagine you're not just going to have say one measurement of speed for the whole journey from wherever you start to wherever you end up there's going to be many of those at each different time step right so there's there's all this underlying kind of information that needs to be stored in our database and we need to retrieve it later so that's what we're going to do with the back end piece so again i'm just showing this to you so you kind of have a little bit of context of what it's doing but the front end isn't really all that important as we launch okay here's where this stuff gets fun and important so in cassandra and i already saw some folks asking about this earlier in the discord chat one in particular was saying hey i'm new to databases i didn't come from the relational world am i going to be okay and i'm like you're probably going to be in a better place for those of you coming from the relational world like many of us um you know you there's a set way that we've kind of been doing things for a long time now cassandra isn't that much different we still have a required schema we're going to create um our tables in a schema just like it would in the relation world the difference is in the how so in cassandra we're actually going to use our queries we're going to use our application workflow and the queries that we generate from that to generate our data model that's a little bit different from how we might do it in the relational world what i want you to focus on here is the first two things you see on the left-hand side the conceptual data model and the application workflow so anybody who's you know generally speaking if you've been doing any kind of coding or database work at all you're probably familiar with the conceptual data model we're going to look at one in a moment but you're going to take that and the application workflows so imagine any application at all the vast majority of e-commerce applications are going to have some kind of user tracking it doesn't even have to be e-commerce the vast majority of applications do well the second you know that you're going to have say a user function in a user login function you're already starting to map out some of what that application workflow looks like right oh i need to log in for a user i need security for the user i need to store information about the user all these types of things start to generate like pseudo queries if you will right now we're not going to be going down the user path here i'm just giving this example but you'll find that as you ask the questions from your app what types of things does it need to do you are already starting to write your queries you just might not know it yet so we're going to go through that process right so again we're going to start with the conceptual data model with our application workflows then we're actually going to use that to start generating our logical data model right this is where we start to look at the pseudo tables like okay what tables might i need what fields maybe they do they need what keys do i need right then once we've kind of broken that down we'll then move that to a physical data model so what kind of you know field types do i need right and honestly going from logical to physical isn't that hard it's it's it's actually just going one's defining what the structure is going to look like the other one's defining what the types are and then you implement with your cql so if you haven't done this before we're gonna break it down we're gonna go through it um so don't worry there and some of the resources we are going to send you to as well um will really break it down even more okay so i will point out here that starting with the application workflows actually in one sense a more logical way to to do things because you're eliminating from the thought process all the post-processing of the data because you're starting to store your data in the way you want it retrieved so it's actually super super efficient to do things this way um you're just going to end up with redundant data due to denormalization so if you start to kind of do the mind shift this direction for maybe a more traditional uh you know or normal form or something like that that you actually will experience um even in the even in the relational world you experience gains for doing it this way um it's actually pretty cool you're exchanging storage for cleaner iops essentially is what it boils down to yeah by the way i see um uh shipping kumar on youtube says some are very new to this please explain big words very good point yeah um this session will be two hours uh niraj um so as far as like some of the things that eric just mentioned there right um and i guess we should just give a little explanation about cassandra right so if you want or uh either way we'll we'll go back and forth right so so cassandra is a distributed nosql database right um it the core tenants are its ability to perform at scale and when i say perform we're talking about maintaining like tight single digit you know tens of millis response time and reads no matter the scale a cassandra database could be a couple of nodes it could be thousands of nodes right it could be pedette petabytes of data and it does this while also maintaining robustness it's known to be an extremely robust database you can learn lose big percentages of the database and it's still available um to you know to handle requests and such uh some examples um netflix uber sony playstation right uh apple stuff from uh siri and such um most of the banks and credit cards yeah what else you have eric yeah twitter is definitely one twitter instagram spotify yeah yeah so basically anything that uses any sort of scale is probably using cassandra somewhere because it really is the only thing out there that scales linearly um you know nosql obviously is a large grouping of a ton of different database technologies i've seen a lot of people in chat mentioning like couch different things but those have limits to how far you know either they're using a sharding technology that that's limiting or there's some sort of a a primary secondary relationship master slave relationship for you know the more legacy terms but cassandra gets around all of that by not not even approaching things from that angle it starts basically trying to handle things in a pure relationship using distributed hashmap so we're going to get into the architecture of that today but it really is powerful and you get a hundred percent of the value of the node you're adding to the cluster at a thousand nodes the same as you would it adding it at you know like 10 nodes it that same 100 value of that new node is there so you can just keep scaling and scaling and scaling until your network is completely saturated and then you have to upscale your network right it's it's really cool what you can actually accomplish with this yeah and so by the way to be clear a lot of the stuff that we were just talking about is not stuff that you need to worry about today matter of fact that's where that's where astr comes into play um so we'll we'll talk a little bit more about astr in a second but astro is fully managed for you so you don't have to worry about some of those underlying details what it what it really boils down to though cassandra is a database that was purpose built to be able to scale horizontally and definitely to be able to maintain 100 uptime right whether it's upgrades or whether there's outages it's actually built to handle outages right because it is built on the the idea that no matter what network you're on no matter what you know system you're on if it's on-prem that's in the cloud something somewhere is going to fail and so you need to have a database that can handle that kind of thing and it's also built to inherently replicate so no matter where you could have a completely global database and no matter where it is in the world if i like say you know i create or i insert some data over on the west coast of the americas right well if i've got other parts of my database that are say in china and australia and stuff that data will automatically be replicated out and it's this kind of combination of things i'm really kind of glossing over a lot but it's this combination of things that makes cassandra so powerful and makes it so these companies that we're talking about use it right and they use it for their you know their their mission critical type operations okay so with that with that now by the way i i know that some of you have questions on relational comparisons keep asking them um again we will have a ton of resources that we're going to send to you if we don't get to some of the questions today we have resources that we'll send you that's going to help really build this knowledge up instead of us trying to dump it all on you in 20 minutes or something okay so let's go through designing your data model and what that looks like like i said we're going to start with the conceptual data model there we go all right so if you've ever again worked with you know an entity uh diagram or something you should this should look familiar to you but if you haven't let's go ahead and take a look to break down what we've got going on here right so remember we mentioned that in this application we're going to be tracking spacecraft journeys and some of the metrics that come with that so take a look at the left-hand side you'll see i have a journey entity there right so we know that that's like the the basic thing we're going to start with is okay i have a journey and i need to record something about a particular journey so what kind of properties might a journey have well if i'm tracking journeys for a spacecraft i probably have a spacecraft property i probably want to know when it starts and when it ends maybe some unique identifier with a uid is it active or not is it in progress right now or is it already ended um and then maybe get some kind of summary if you take a look on the right hand side you'll see reading speed reading temperature and so on these are our these are our sensors right now if you imagine as i have a journey of a spacecraft again it's not just going to be a single speed reading or a single temperature reading i'm going to have readings at time steps as that journey is going on so you'll see that each of these there are properties like reading time right um so i'm going to be taking readings probably multiple times a second right depending on what kind of sensor it is or something like that and storing those and then each of those is going to store whatever that value is and then we'll store the units right so that's where you see the properties that reading time read and unit now the other thing i want to point out is notice next to journey right to the right of it there's a 1 and then if you look at the sensor metrics there reading speed temperature and so on and so forth you see that zero to n what we're saying here is there is a one-to-many relationship between a journey and say reading speed so that says i could for any one journey i could have zero or n number of reading speeds that's what we're saying there so we've already identified a lot of information right we've we've marked out multiple entities we have properties for those and then we're marking out what is the relationship between these particular entities now let's take that over to our application workflows now like i mentioned before the application workflows are really about starting to generate the types of things that i need to say look up or create or you know the the interaction i have with my application and the database like the kind of questions my application's going to want this is where i actually start generating my pseudo queries so what do i mean so take a look at that first bullet where it says space crafts catalog queries right look under that well for any particular spacecraft journey i probably want to have the ability to look up all of the journeys of a spacecraft because if you think about it i might have like a falcon x rocket right that can have more than one journey so a single spacecraft may have multiple journeys and i want to be able to look them up or i want to look at the state of a journey is it currently active is it done whatever or i want to create a new journey now if you think about the way these read create a new journey what is that that's probably an insert statement right or maybe an update i'm putting something into the database the lookups are probably reads so you can kind of start to see where i'm working out these pseudo queries like the kind of queries i might need to then create my tables moving on if you look at that second bullet that sensor reading queries again these are our speed pressure temperature and location i most likely want to save a bunch of those over time right because for each of those time steps i'm going to be saving the sensor readings that probably sounds again like an insert or an update depending on what you're doing um i want to be able to analyze each dimension independently right so it's saying i want to be able to look just a speed or just a pressure just a temperature so all of this is starting to kind of inform what my data model is going to look like now let me take a look i want to see i'm going to see if how are we doing with questions um uh looks like the guys are mostly on top of it here okay um there's a lot of questions as to how things compare to other nosql databases okay um most of those are being answered um i will just throw this out there uh cassandra is taking a lot of the best concepts from the nosql movement and applying them wholeheartedly so um i saw one earlier that said so cassandra is basically the best of nosql graph and sql kind of yes kind of know it's not really a graph database there's no joins um basically it's it's taken everything back steps from before we needed joins to actually accomplish things and said in a perfect world how do we do things and then built up the database from there so that's why we denormalize that's why we actually work with cassandra the way we work with it so um yeah it uses rows and columns um things are distributed over partitions it's active active everywhere so globally distributed databases you can read and write from any location um at the same time concurrently um yeah there there's a lot of different capabilities that are unique to cassandra that um just simply are are incredibly empowering when you actually learn how to use them so yeah and there's a i see a couple i see malcolm uh the iot tryhard me is so excited yes this is definitely an iot use case that's very funny um i see uh in discord says but if it's about fault tolerance then why go for a managed service at all great question i was actually gonna i was gonna say something about that here in a moment but since you asked the question um if you think about it yeah the fault tolerance is there that's not a problem but the difference is between do you want to manage your own cassandra cluster completely on your own and all of the um the i.t that's needed with that and such or in this case with astra it's being managed for you right not only is it being managed for you but datasacks you know we've been in the cassandra world since the beginning um you know we are the experts um i'm not saying we're the only experts i want to make that very clear but we we definitely have uh have our time and we've written most the code right so uh so with that we also have a lot of experience of running clusters in production environments um and so what we've done is we've taken that experience and that knowledge and that's baked in how astra works so you'll find that a lot of the base default say parameters all the configuration parameters all that stuff is being essentially built for you if you manage your own you could totally do that but then you have to figure those things out and find those yourself so that's the big difference between the manage and not manage and in the managed case we're doing it for you in the not managed stuff you have to do it that's really what it comes into yeah absolutely and i will throw this out there um back when we would set up cassandra and we you know download the tar balls and set up our vms with our nodes and all that stuff for these sorts of sessions um we spent about half the day setting up everything right now we have two hours so from a self-service perspective for today when you can just click a button have it start doing operations data in data out seeing how this whole thing works um there's a lot of value there for today so definitely go ahead sign up that astro account if you haven't already um it's free we aren't charging you we're asking for a credit card nothing like that um just you know go ahead and sign up okay so now moving from where we were just a second ago so i want you to do is take the conceptual data model what we've done here take the questions we're asking ourselves and the application workflow these pseudo queries now we want to start to map that to some tables right i'm going to call them pseudo tables because we haven't really worked them out yet we're just getting a feel now here's what i want to point out notice on the left-hand side we have our spacecraft journey catalog and then the right-hand side we have our temperature location speed and pressure we have our center sensor metrics again what does that look like it looks a lot like our entities what we're doing over here in the conceptual data model right that's a really good place to start once you start mapping this out then you're like okay i've got some pseudo tables i know that i want to record my spacecraft journeys and i also want to record my sensor metrics so let's go ahead and create tables that will start to facilitate that now you might ask well why are you creating a separate table for each one of these central metrics why can't you just store them in one right you could you know um looking you know if you really wanted to you might ask later on if performance if that makes sense but here's the key thing notice under sensor readings queries one of the one of the items i have is analyze each dimension independently right so it's kind of requirement we've set you know as part of our our workflow here so what that means is i want to be able to go ahead and analyze any one of those metrics without having to filter out the others or stuff you know so anyway so you just start to see where we're using both the conceptual data model and the application workflow to start to generate our pseudo tables now what we do is now we start to put the fields to this we start to look at not only what data do i want to store in each of these tables but then also what are my keys what are the things that will uniquely identify a row now again i'd like to point out take a look at the spacecraft journey catalog on the left hand side notice that the fields that you see there those map really strongly to the properties we had in our conceptual data model right we're just it's almost taking the conceptual data model and just implementing it as tables really the big difference is what you what you notice in the nomenclature so take a look you'll see these k's there are k's there and then c so this is what's called the chewbacco diagram it's a wayne cassandra and data modeling we use to map out you know some of the logical pieces of my data model so like where are my keys so a k means a partition key so in cassandra when you store something you're storing it by partitions right now that c is called a clustering column clustering columns are used for ordering or uniqueness so let's break this down what this means so in the case of the spacecraft journey catalog what we're saying is that i want to partition by spacecraft name and then i want to cluster by journey id now journey id in this case is a uuid it's a unique identifier right so again i mentioned before how for an individual spacecraft i could have multiple journeys right so i want some way to uniquely identify him we're doing that the journey id what this reads as is for a particular spacecraft journey if i provide the spacecraft name and the journey id i get a unique row that tells me i'm going to get a unique set of data that then i can pull my start and active and summary fields from right so in cassandra just like relational databases by the way you have a concept of a primary key what's the purpose of a primary key it uniquely identifies a row so spacecraft name and journey id are going to be the things i'm going to use to uniquely identify a row anything else is just data if you take a look at the right hand side and we'll go with spacecraft speed over time it's the same by the way these are all the same all the metrics um the sensor metrics are pretty much the same except for the data they store we're doing the same thing right we want to say well what what fields do i need to include in my primary key to give a unique row now look at this it's spacecraft name is a k so it's a partition key journey id is also a k so we're saying we're partitioning by spacecraft name and journey id but now we have reading time that's added in there as a clustering column right now think about what would happen if we didn't put reading time in there we just had spacecraft name journey id speed and speed unit okay my spacecraft launches i record a speed and now another time step goes and i record another speed but if i don't have a reading time if that's not part of my row uniqueness my key then i'm just going to overwrite the one that was before it right and and so on so i need to have i need to insert something in there that's going to ensure that each of the time steps i have is being recorded as a separate row that's what we're doing here that's why we added reading time there's another piece of this reading time this is actually a cool optimization in cassandra especially for those of you familiar with relational databases and how they work so notice the c again that means clustering column and those can be used for ordering and or uniqueness so in this case a time stamp right we're probably talking about ordering but notice the arrow that down arrow that's saying i want to order in descending order right so as new time as new data is coming in then my data will automatically get ordered on the right where it's fastest so later on when i read the data out i'm automatically getting the data out in in descending time format i do not need to do an order buy i don't need to pay for that cost at the read we've already done it at the right so when you read it you literally read the block out already ordered it's a nice little optimization i'm not going too far into it that's where you get into like the read and write path but it's another way that cassandra optimizes to be able to maintain its performance at scale no matter how large or small the database is right that's one of the key things about cassandra yeah go ahead eric and if you think about what actually just happened there it you kind of covered it but there was this cool little tidbit there you're actually storing the data in the manner you want it retrieved yes perfectly so so if you think about it again from an operator's perspective or any of our admins out there in the audience what's happening from an iops perspective since we're actually searching data from an ordered ss table or a grouping of ordered ss tables we can theoretically accomplish rain queries with a single iop making it super super efficient so the processing to actually retrieve your data is incredibly minimal and that's why we get such fast read times that's why you can actually return large blocks of data in us you know like three to seven millisecond p99s it's really really powerful because we're actually pre-optimizing the way our data is stored for retrieval so i do see a couple questions on youtube here um that i think are really relevant um rocks is the data also ordered in descending order based on partitioning key no it's based off the clustering column right so you'll have a you'll have a partition in this case you'll have a partition by spacecraft name and journey id so imagine those two fields right then for that partition within it you will have all of the individual all the individual uh rows for the speed since we're going with that example right and it'll be ordered based off of that clustering column reading time not the actual partition key um yeah and i'll throw one other people in there the permission key what it actually does for anyone who's curious that's actually what controls the data distribution so what we actually do with the partition key is we hash it and create a tokenized value and then all of the individual nodes in the cluster own a certain range of tokens and so that that partition will live on whatever nodes have that token ownership so it's not being ordered by that but it is being distributed by that yeah now by the way to be clear we don't expect everyone who especially is not familiar with cassandra to understand a lot of the things that we've been talking about in the last 10 minutes because we're having the gloss over a lot because this isn't like an intro to cassandra course however the material as a matter of fact cedric or jack are someone who's online if you wouldn't mind dropping this this be wonderful we will talk about it here a little bit later but our datasets.com dev site in there is all of the cassandra fundamentals and now it's not just reading it's actually interactive exercises that you do embedded in your browser it's all free they're wonderful they will give you all of this information so for those of you who are interested in knowing more about the stuff we've been kind of talking about totally check those out matter of fact i believe some is for homework actually today um so yeah you're going to really want to check those out they're going to go into all the details that we kind of need to gloss over today yeah so we got a question here or kind of a confirmation i think so each partition stays on a different node um yeah i mean they're distributed you're not gonna really know what partitions are where unless you start looking under the hood center handles that all automatically it does all the hashing automatically does the distribution automatically um all the only thing you need to worry about is what you're putting inside each part to each partition so essentially that primary key construction is your control to data distribution and ordering so if you can make it so a single query will hit a single partition then you can make something very very efficient because it will all be living in one spot all of the data you're trying to return off a range query will be living in one spot on one node will be retrievable in the ordered manner from that node um again super super efficient if you construct your primary yeah your primary key correctly and and kartik i see that cedric gave you an answer to your is the partition key used for sharding uh he already answered it but yeah it's essentially a shard if you think about it it it's really that's how you're yeah i hate calling it a shard because that bears its own yeah it has its own meanings that drags with it but yes it is all right all right so we should we should move on um so again so now again we've taken we've taken our conceptual data model our application workflow we've used that to generate our pseudo tables now we're looking at spelling out the logical data model defining what are our keys what is our data right that's what really what we've done here keys what's a unique row and then what's the data that i want the payload that i want to go along with that now we start mapping that to the physical data model now notice all that happened here is i just went from defining what my keys and those relationships might be to now just defining the types that's it right so if you can take a look at the left-hand side you'll see okay spacecraft name is a text type journey id is a time uuid by the way tommy uid is a cool object it combines a timestamp and a unique identifier a uuid those are actually really neat um and then i don't think the rest of this is gonna be much uh you know the mystery you know start and end or probably time stamps active whether it is or not a boolean makes sense a summary text so we're just we're taking the same exact structure we had a moment ago now we're just mapping to the fields and then for the final piece now we take this end result the combination of the logical and physical data model and we use that to generate our cql ddl right ddl by the way is data definition language it's the same in the relational world these are the type of statements we're going to use to generate our schema create our tables and such so you'll see we have this nomenclature this create table if not exists here's my spacecraft journey catalog this is the actual syntax you're going to use in cql to do this the fields match exactly what we had in our logical and physical data models the same thing with the types the difference there is in that primary key so if you remember back in the logical data model here where we have the k's and the c's again k's or partition keys c's are clustering columns now that tells me when i go to write my cql what i need to do right so you'll notice in that primary key field on the bottom you'll see these parens with spacecraft name anything in those parens is a partition key and then comma and anything after that's a clustering column so if you take the spacecraft example here notice i have spacecraft name k and journey id c so okay i've got a partition key of spacecraft name and a journey id is my clustering column so in my primary key i'm defining spacecraft name as my partition key comma journey id says clustering column and then i'm telling it the order with clustering order by i'm saying okay i want you to order my clustering column journey id descending if i take the example of oh like yeah um yeah go ahead go ahead yeah i was just gonna say and if you think about what this is actually doing from a uh how your data will look perspective that means everything pertaining to that spacecraft name in that table will be within that partition and will live on the same node yeah oh by the way i see a question from shatan in uh discord why not have ansi sql guess what cql is actually a subset of sql um so you'll find that the language looks exactly the same there are some differences here and there um in how you manage the database and such yeah yeah for sure yeah we don't joins we don't do some of the other stuff that you would expect from cql um but it is it is very very similar you should feel very at home with this yes if you're familiar with sql you'll be familiar with cql himrocks the answer to that it's not clustering query language it's cassandra query language is is what it is there you go okay so in the second example here now we're taking our spacecraft's speed over time again it's the same deal right where we have the same fields and types that we have identified in our logical and physical data models notice that primary key though right remember in the case of the spacecraft speed over time we had both spacecraft name and journey id were partition keys with reading time as a clustering column so when i get my ddl notice that spacecraft name and journey id are in the parens comma whatever comes after that as a clustering column reading time we're then telling it with clustering order by reading time descending order so this right here alone is enough that no matter what order my data comes in or anything based off that reading time it will automatically be ordered by the reading time okay and then one thing is kind of like a little special deal it's called a udt a user defined type so udt's are really good for objects that themselves have multiple properties that you're intending to reuse a lot an address is a great example of this right an address has what it has a street a city a state a zip code a country it may have other things depending on what other countries you're in but you know that's probably going to be the same the same properties for any address and there's a good chance that if you have multiple tables that use address you don't want to repeat all those fields in every single one of those tables a udt is a really great use case for that so in this case instead of address we're using it for location for xyz coordinates why because we're going to be using it in multiple places and all of those locations are going to look identical with the underlying properties that they have the example here is in spacecraft location over time notice if you look down about say three-fourths of the way down the fields here you're gonna see location frozen location udt so what we're saying is we're creating a type called location udt that has x y and z coordinates and then when we create our table we're referencing that location udt as a type so there's going to be a location field that has location udt as a type which means that it now will have access to x y and z coordinates and i don't have to then create x y and z coordinates for every single one of the tables i want to use i just use a crate i create one single udt and i apply that across the board okay so with that moving on to the next part so that was the general overview right going from a use case to our data model and then how we use that to generate uh the data model so in this next part we're going to look a little bit more at astra um and uh and then creating our schema so astra as i we are kind of talked about it right it is a fully managed cloud-based cassandra that's really what it is right so where if you were to use apache cassandra on your own um you would have to maintain and operate and administrate that database in the case of astra you spin it up through the interface all of that is being done for you you literally just tell it um key pieces information like you know what do you want to call it the username and password and go right all of the rest of it's being managed for you what we're going to use today is the free tier it's free forever there's no obligation nothing like that it's a five gig free tier you can delete and create and do stuff at your heart's content and wonderful there are though if you want to go i mean the free tier is going to be a one end right but then there's enterprise enterprise class stuff at the other so if you really want to you know you know beef it up and you want to go production level stuff astra does have that as well but again to be clear we're going to be focusing on the free tier today we don't intend to have everybody you know trying to charge up uh credit cards or anything um right you know or anything like that okay we do have a couple questions here um is there a 30 second explanation of multi-key primary key for those of us who think primary key composites yeah primary key as always being a single column yeah absolutely so a partition key that uses multiple columns essentially all that's happening there is we're adding those two columns together and hashing that resulting value to get you know the the um token range ownership where that thing is going to live where the partition is going to live so there's nothing really magical about it it's it's really just providing an extra layer of uniqueness by taking two values instead of one um i hope that answers the question let me know if that didn't um and then there was another one where was it here um okay oh yeah there it is um can it uh i'm assuming this is in relation to udts uh can it store an array or json i mean the data data type like double and etc so there is a blob type but you should be a little bit careful with just kind of throwing things into it you're not going to have parseval json like a document store for example that's just not what sandra is really there for there is a way to do some stuff through stargate if you've played with stargate at all it's uh essentially an api layer what would you call it david circuit's an api that's server yeah it's an api layer that allows for a lot of i guess complex expanded query options so it'll allow you to essentially use cassandra as a document store or you know play with some other uh other things like sander wouldn't normally do natively but um yeah by and large um you can store blobs but you know you're not gonna be querying off of an array or anything like that you have to return the whole array and then parse it in your code doable and depending on your use case might work but okay so um just a couple more things about astra itself so other than being a managed cassandra what else does it provide right if you look at the left hand side you see those dev tools there so more than just okay here's the database and do something with it right there's a cql console embedded um there's rest and graphql apis that eric was actually just kind of alluding to a second ago so you don't only have to use the drivers like what we're doing today you can actually do things through rest and graphql um there's dataset studio that's embedded so if you want a nice um jupiter notebook like interface a graphical interface that you can use to execute queries store like an engineering notebook share with your colleagues or whatever you can totally do that there's a data loader loader that allows you to book load data in it is also multi-cloud it is supported across aws azure and google cloud you'll find today on the free tier though the only option you're allowed on the free tier is google cloud once you start getting to the other tiers the rest open up for you but that's just something special with the way the free tier works and then there are a whole set of ops tools there as well right um so we're not really getting into a lot of those today um but like the service broker is one to use with kubernetes right there's metrics that are embedded um there's there's already authentication for you and stuff so we're gonna talk about some of this but there's a lot more to it it's not just throw up the database and you're on your own kind of deal yeah absolutely okay sorry for the hands-on let's get into the hands-on yeah so if you haven't already done it um now is probably a good time to go to destax dot io workshop i know we dropped those links earlier we should probably drop them again real quick just to make sure now for those of you who are joining us again you've been with us before if you have an existing astra database you do not need to delete it all you have to do when we go through the exercises is add a new key space right we can matter of fact eric when we do that we should probably show that point it out it's really easy you literally click the add key space button just add the name of the key space and that's it it'll you're done right so it's not hard to do just take note that we're asking everybody to use the default key space username and password values if you're creating a new database if you had an existing database those are obviously going to be a little different there's a step in the exercises later on where you're going to need to update the configuration to ensure that you're pointing to the right key space username and password just take note that if you had an existing database and you added a key space you need to use your values not the values here you probably won't be able to connect and i'll point that out as we go along for sure yeah yeah we'll definitely do that um the last thing is that download the secure connect bundle again we'll go through this in the exercises um the secure connect bundle is actually kind of like an unsung hero in my opinion um if you imagine we have a lot of java developers who are on here i'd love to see a thumbs up or something from all of you that have had fun implementing ssl with java because it's not fun at all right um so what we've done is as part of astra you get per your database what's called a secure connect bundle you just download it it has all the artifacts and everything you need for full encryption between your application and the database right because if you think about it these are these are cloud databases you don't want to sit there and just have like open ips or anything all the information you need as far as where the database is and everything is all contained in that secure connect bundle so what this does for you because the drivers recognize the secure connect bundle it's really easy it allows you to just say point to the secure connect bundle give it your username and password and that's all you need to worry about the rest of the driver handles the rest for you um including the the secure encrypted connection so um that means nobody none of us have to write any ssl code to talk to the database which is awesome if you've ever done it all right all right so with that the first hands-on exercise we're actually if you haven't done it already uh we're going to go ahead and create your astra database and that's like i said it should only take a minute or two um then you will create the schema so the schema that we talked about earlier that we've we've generated for you you'll take that you'll create that schema in the cql console with an astra and then you'll have the base schema that you need um to get going with the rest of the workshop and with that mr eric you whether you're ready or not your screen is now shared [Laughter] i shared it for you all right there we go okay so first thing we're going to do here um i'm going to link this github for everyone again this is the place where all the resources we're going to use today are living so definitely make sure you navigate there i am actually going to follow the github as well and show you kind of what steps i'm on to try to take you through it if you get stuck on anything there's a table of contents there you'll be able to navigate through up and down um it's it's all done via the readme so you'll see here um we have action i lost eric did i lose everybody um hey eric just so you know you dropped off just for a second so anything you said in the last like 10 seconds got dropped if you want won't mind repeating it okay yeah i can uh i can go back um so we have our table of contents here so you can navigate up and down if you get stuck or anything um navigate to the the steps you missed um we also have these sections are clearly defined within different steps green check marks denote steps um pretty simple and i'll take you through it so don't worry if you have any questions asked we have people monitoring the chat uh let's all do this alright so first thing we're actually going to do is we are going to go ahead and i'm going to open a new tab here and click on that guy right there that is going to bring us to astra if you haven't already gone there and created your account please do so now i am going to actually oops i don't want to sign up because i already have an account so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to click sign in and that is going to bring me to the sign in page or actually just sign me in because i signed in earlier don't tell anyone um and i'm going to go ahead here and i'm going to select the free option now you're not going to be required to put in a credit card if you select the free option don't select server list just select free this is a persistent database free forever five gigabytes data it's yours so go ahead and select that then we're going to go down here i'm going to select google cloud i suggest you do as well that's just the provider that this database will live on so you'll see that aws and azure are also options there um google cloud is just easy for today all right and then since i am in the us i'm going to choose us east as my region that's the closest geo-located region to me um if you're in europe or asia i believe europe west is the closest we have currently available for you so go ahead and click that and then just right up here we're going to hit configure database now this is the step where all those values david was talking about need to be put in so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to go back to the github repo and i am going to pull those exact values so let's go here database name uh is already going to be uh here we go there we go database name my astra cluster and we're gonna have spacecraft is going to be the key space name key space name boom and then we are going to take s user or our user and we're super secure here we are actually showing everyone the password but don't worry these are uh not going to live very long so mine isn't all right so go ahead and click create database and that will go and bring us to the databases panel here boom all right there we are all right so we see this card right here this is essentially my database what this is going to do for me in just a moment here it's going to show up with a pending status man that mechanical keyboard there david oh man is it that loud i didn't realize i was getting picked up yeah i'm gonna go ahead and refresh it looks like it might have not oh it is just pending okay there we go status is pending so this database is uh working on spinning up it shouldn't take very long there's a minute or two yeah 300 of us who are all spinning these up at once so we'll see we'll see how it goes but it should basically go active here in just a moment um and then i'll actually go ahead and show you guys there we go so what i can do here um i can i have a few options i can terminate it i can launch studio which is that notebook style uh interface david was talking about we can also do some data loading we can connect which we'll do in a moment and we can park now parking is what you do if you're not going to use your database for a while it basically saves the data but spins down the actual compute resource um so your database doesn't go away really really useful if you're actually doing a paid astro database but you aren't going to use it for a few weeks much lower cost okay so hey eric real quick since you already have a database i do see at least one person in person over on youtube was asking can you show what to do if you have an existing database to add the key space yeah i'm going to go ahead here i clicked on my database card so that brings me into the database and then what i'm going to go do is i'm going to scroll down here to where it says key spaces you'll notice i have my spacecraft database there i'm going to go ahead and click add and i'm just going to say data or key space to key spay if i can spell space two and i'm going to go ahead and click save now i have two key spaces it's really that simple so um if you already had one from before just go ahead and create one called spacecraft and we will keep on moving remember though that when we do get into the code you are going to have to change the username and password to connect to your database to whatever um from whatever sorry to whatever the uh uh ones you previously had configured r and you can go through astra and you know set those up how you want if you need okay so next thing we're going to go ahead and we're going to hit connect now connect is going to bring us to this nice documentation page that walks us through everything all the different drivers the the apis we have access to um i am going to go ahead here and i am going to click on python just because i'm going to be using python today it's actually the same exact thing we're going to be doing here if you click node or any of the other drivers i'm going to go to download bundle and i a click a little drop down there it brings up the database i have i'm going to right click on that and i am going to go down and copy link address okay we're gonna go ahead and click that and then we're gonna go back to github and since we have that copied we've actually gone through all of the steps here and we're gonna go down to the very uh where is it here where's the button did we get rid of the button for uh git pod david no no it's in it's in the actual oh it's in the bottom yeah yeah yeah yeah you're getting your head to yourself i don't follow the instructions step or step all right um so i'm sorry about that everyone i'm getting ahead of myself i'm gonna go ahead and click cql console right up here at the top where there's summary health connect cql console um this actually brings up a cql prompt or a standard query language prompt which will allow me to interact with my database this should feel the same as any sql tool uh you know command line tool you've used in the past i can actually go ahead and i can use spacecraft and it does have tab autocomplete so feel free to type in ass hit tab and it should auto complete for you now what this has done is set the context for me so i am now in the spacecraft key space if i wanted to use that second key space i had created which was key space 2 i could do use key space two and now you'll notice in the little prompt there you we can see which context i was in for right now though i do need to use uh oops uh spacecraft because that's what we're gonna be working with here today okay so next thing we actually have to do is we have to get some schema here so we actually provided the schema for you um all these ddl statements are essentially what we're going to use today so i'm actually just going to copy paste right into the cql console there we'll give that a moment to complete and it will complete in just a second there we go okay and what i can do to make sure that those statements worked is i can actually run a describe command so let's go ahead describe uh let's just describe the ski key space so uh space craft and it spits out a whole bunch of different table definitions now these are the tables we just created it's important to note there's this kind of huge blob of stuff at the end of all these table definitions right here where it says you know additional write policy and all these things don't worry about that for today that's uh if you're an operator and you want to do some like really fine-tuning crazy stuff that you know not with the defaults that's where you actually see a lot of your tuning that you had done uh don't worry about that here though we are not going to be messing with that nothing to worry about the important part right here is basically from the create table statement down to the primary key um definition and of course the uh clustering column is also um important there for ordering okay next step so um if we just went and said describe tables since we're already using the context it went it would have spit out the table names i like to show the actual table structures though because it kind of makes it a little a little more real i think but there are our table names we do indeed have the tables we were trying to create all right this is where it gets cool so go ahead and right click i'm going to right click open in new tab on git pod this get pod button will essentially preload um oh it it logged me out let us continue give me just a moment here while i get logged back in wow it is making me go through all the steps did i get de-authorized one moment here well it syncs and loading okay so initializing workspace so what this is is essentially a in browser ide it's actually based i think on the same uh same code base as a vs code so it's got a feel and look almost exactly the same as vs code but it's going to be running in my browser it's going to be preloaded with my project which there we go all right so we see the project there we can even go to that readme i was just in and we can see the raw raw text so very very cool here we can just click a button i'm already ready to go with my ide boom done all right so i'm going to go into the python here and just take a look at what we have here we have db connection now db connection is a very important place where we're going to um if you had it uh used a different key space and and had to make a new one like you had a keystone's previously created and you had to make a new one um this is where you will actually go ahead and change your username and password to whatever they were before um so just point out here um definitely key space will stay the same because um you should just create a new key space but db connection if you in the python is where you'll create that i believe db connection js in the javascript all right moving on i'm going to go ahead and click here on the i decided to use python uh tab now what that does for us is that's going to give me a readme that's specific to python there should be a close parallel to everything you should be able to follow the node.js if you prefer node.js feel free to go through it no worries at all um i'm just going to go through python because that is my link hey eric before you do that though um i think we have a couple questions and then we do have some other materials to go through before we get into that part absolutely so let's see um i did see one here where did it go oh yeah um uh layla was asking can you please show us the use command again maybe you could go back over real quick what you did there in the cql console and and point out everything that eric is doing is in the github repository so there's no command or anything that you're going to get today that we're just expecting you to follow eric and like somehow magically copy off the screen it is all in the readme so if you're following along in that readme you should have the commands there yeah we also have a question how to upload secure connect bundle get to git pod we will get there don't worry we will do that in just a couple minutes here all right so the use cap excuse me use command i'm just going to type in use i'm going to type in in this case uh key space 2 because that's my second key space here and again on the prompt there you'll notice it says token that's equal h blah blah then it has that context there where it says key space two that tells me what key space i'm working with currently essentially it's just setting a namespace or a context so um pretty simple i'm gonna go ahead and switch back to uh space craft there we go and i'm back in my spacecraft context hopefully that answered the question um david i think you had a couple of slides to present or some such yeah so let's go ahead and well i want to give folks a moment i do see there are just a couple folks that still have databases that are initializing um for the rest of you if you can give us a thumbs up let us know that you've got your database you're good to go you've been able to follow along with eric and create those tables and while while we do that for a second himrocks is key space the same as schema and relational database yeah pretty much a schema or a database in a relational database is equivalent it's pretty close yeah it's a bucket that stores tables so yeah very similar yeah and i just saw a comment will we be able to research this lecture should we have trouble catching up totally everything that we're doing today is not only record it uh it will be on youtube at the same length that you're using to watch right now but this github repository um everything it's all meant to be self-service right so if you're not able to keep up for now that's totally cool you can just follow up there will actually be a little homework as well and this is the key of where that discord channel comes into play um because if you have follow-up questions if you run into trouble if you're just curious about stuff that's a great place to ask is in the discord channel um because then you'll be able to hit us anytime right okay let's see i'm seeing some thumbs up come in says initializing yep there's there's a few that uh have initializing still that's okay it shouldn't take too long we should be there before we actually hit the step where we're having to use yeah usually usually it only takes a couple minutes but i wonder with everybody at the same time it could take up to about 10 with everyone doing it at the same time there that could just be taking a little bit longer for a couple folks um but i am asking i am asking the team to take a look just to make sure um for those that are initializing that it's all good um so well i would say yeah just like eric said be patient and uh we will yeah that's right yeah we will we'll just we'll move on and i have a hunch that by the time that a lot of um a lot of you are still seeing the initializing as we move on they should they should clear up okay interesting and you know something for some of you who are seeing that initializing try refreshing your browser i'm kind of curious that would be kind of funny with it yeah an improper use command that's interesting i am not sure on that one if you can post what you're seeing um that would be helpful i already did it every 10 seconds that's funny oh yeah all right we're getting some more thumbs up okay all right well while we're waiting for that let me go ahead and just go through a little bit more of the okay okay so i'm seeing the same thing the refresh it's not changing anything now it's active so okay so one of them that was um was trying to initialize for the last couple of minutes just like the rest of you did go active so i think i think part of it might just be with so many doing it all at the same time it might just be taking a little bit longer again these are free tier you know these these are definitely on the lower commodity and uh yeah right right it's when you get into the other tiers a little different so all right so i'm going to take the screen back here real quick and we'll just let those finish and i'm just going to talk a little bit more about some of the stuff that we're doing here um so when for any of the drivers and i kind of mentioned this way in the beginning right depending on you know if you're using node or if you're using python or if using java whatever right the driver teams i think have actually done a really bang-up job of keeping these as homogeneous as possible meaning that generally the things that i do in one driver the type of syntax nomenclature and stuff that i use i should say more nomenclature will be the same right obviously syntax in different programming languages will be different but the concepts everything we're going to talk about is the same across the board generally speaking um so you'll see at the top there um these are the the current languages that are supported by the official data sex drivers um we actually opened these up these are open source last year they're now one unified set of drivers i know from talking to some of you that we have some data sex enterprise folks on um in the past you would have had one set for data sex enterprise and a different set for open source cassandra they're all unified now so if you have the latest drivers you should be it shouldn't matter what you're using you can use astra you can use dse you can use open source cassandra um now some things to note about the drivers they do a ton for you right out of the box of things that you just don't have to worry about especially if you take a look in the left-hand side under that connectivity heading right things like being token and data center aware load balancing policies you know it's a distributed database obviously i don't want all of my operations going to one node or something like that i want those to be nicely balanced around my cluster and there's all sorts of parameters that come into that well guess what the drivers do that stuff for you can you modify how it does it yes you can but generally speaking a lot of the defaults are pretty darn good right retry policies what happens or reconnection policies what happens if a node goes down or for some reason a particular operation is timing out or something the driver has that stuff kind of baked in right um the connection pooling this is actually something we're going to talk about later where um you only ever want one session object in your app the reason why is because those session objects actually maintain the connection pools to every one of your nodes again this is stuff you don't have to do ssl being a big one that we talked about with that secure connect bundle this is baked into the driver authentication authorization is all there already right um there are other pieces like paging um asynchronous support reactive api for those uh in in java and other languages um there's there's all sorts of real coolness factors that are that are part of the drivers as they are the last thing i'm going to say about that is the drivers actually they connect to your cluster they gossip with it right they're actually aware of the status of the nodes in your cluster and everything they optimize especially if you're using asynchronous queries which you should be in cassandra um but they they optimize the you know the transactions and everything that are coming across you know so there's anyway i can't talk enough about the drivers i never thought i'd actually be so excited about drivers but they just do an absolute ton for you now to install them again the two code languages we're going to use today are node and python it's really it's really simple for both and node you'll say npm install cassandra dash driver and python pip install cassandra driver now the cool thing is in gitpod we've already installed npm and pip and all that for you right all you have to do is issue the commands again you'll do this as part of the exercises so you don't have to like try to type those off the screen now how do you connect now if you remember earlier i mentioned that when you use astra and you use that secure connect bundle the drivers are aware of the secure connect bundle and they will handle all the connection everything for you from there so this is what you're seeing here take a look at the top example with node you'll see that we're creating a client right nobody called a client a new client and when i initialize that new cassandra.client see that cloud secure connect bundle secure.zip now that zip file could be called anything right in this example it's just secure.zip um but that's it right there that one line says look to the secure connect bundle and then it is going to handle all of the ssl piece you know all of finding your cluster and all of that the only thing you need to pass in are the credentials your username and password in python it's a couple extra lines of code just because you have to provide an auth provider and such but otherwise it's generally the same notice one difference is that instead of client it's session you'll find in java it is also session so we call it the session object there but generally speaking it's the same kind of deal yeah point it to your secure connect bundle you pass in the username and password and go yeah and as i mentioned a moment ago the session object is important you only ever need one of them for your whole application period right the session object is also heavy it maintains the connection pools to all of your nodes imagine if you had a thousand node cluster right you don't want to be creating all of these session objects also it maintains metadata for your cluster um so the information about your cluster right so and it's also maintaining what's called the control connection it it talks like i said it actually talks to your database just like your nodes do and it maintains the status of your nodes right so all this information is being stored in the session object you only ever need one of these for your application and you also want to ensure that when you shut down your application that you're shutting down the session as well this is just good practice and ensures that any open sockets or stuff are closed right you don't want to leave those hanging or anything like that and again you'll see this in the examples you see this as we go through the exercises okay so with that mr eric i'll get back over to you we should probably check in some folks i can do that in the chats but now we're going to go through the part where you're going to go ahead you know you've already spun up get pod if not you will you'll install the drivers you're going to pull that secure connect bundle out of astra and get the plumbing going and test your connection yeah so let's check check chats real quick we do have a minute or two i think where we can do it um we can access recordings after live session yes you may we have them all on youtube um so as soon as we're done here basically uploads to youtube and then it you have full access to it um let's see is already done uh is the secure driver bundle already downloading for us and getpod no we're actually gonna go through that step we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna curl it yeah because those secure connect bundles are unique to your database right so at the point that we launched the git pod we wouldn't have that information you need to go into astra to get that now i will say there is a i think it's a brand new feature in astra uh where you can actually launch git pod through astra and have everything pre-configured for you and then build your projects yes that side yeah there are there are code examples in there that let you do that yeah right right but that's not what we're using today so okay um let's see here uh i think we're good can you delete your astra account if you signed in why would you want to delete astro i'm not sure i've never tried to delete master account um that would be one uh if any any of you guys in chat there if you know the answer that one you can follow up let's see uh that would be handy okay all right i'm gonna jump in here then oh i know yeah i know what hazel's referring to i'll take that one okay absolutely all right so hands-on portion let's get into this here um so we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna do exactly what i got ahead of myself and did the first time we're gonna go into our database we're gonna go i'm gonna hit summary now i can either click this connect button up here or i can click disconnect down here they both go to the same place it's just redundant buttons i'm going to go ahead i'm going to click on python click the drop down right click on the cluster copy link address now i need to do this again because if i didn't do it again i would actually um that link times out after a little bit of time um so the one i copied before would probably not be active if i tried to do it now okay i'm also going to go ahead and close a couple things that i'm not using here all right so next we're going to go and we're going to find the curl command now the curl command is right here you'll notice that we basically have it all laid out there's quotes in there those quotes are important if you copy that command and you delete the quotes this command will not work so what i'm actually going to do just so i can kind of show everyone here is i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to create i didn't want to create a new tab i want to create file new file and i'm just going to call it um we'll just call it curl dot sh um not actually gonna run it as a script file but hey uh oh i don't want it there i want it in my python because that's where i'm working and i'm gonna go ahead and i'm going to paste my url i'm going to also copy my curl command here and i'm just going to do a quick edit essentially so i got both of the parts makes it really easy boom i'm going to get rid of your bundle here because that should be what is up above and we will paste okay so that's my curl command i'm going to go ahead and just copy that here now you'll notice it's curl dash l quote the url i copied end quote oops did i get an extra character in there it looks like i might have seen it yes i do have an extra character in there so i better fix that one moment please um if it works it just froze on me uh oh that's not good all right and we will try this again a second time okay let's go ahead and boom there we go make sure you don't have a space after your url that uh it is not happy if you do and to be clear right that that url that he pasted in was the one that he got from right clicking on here right secure connect bundle and saying copy link address right it's very key that you use that yes unique to me so what we did there is we basically just downloaded the secure connect bundle now do we actually have it show up anymore um i'm looking for it here david do you know where this oh there it is i found it yep okay so i got a cruz.zip i'm not gonna actually open it i don't wanna unpack it um the driver is gonna go ahead and consume that so no worries nothing more i need to do it should be all ready to go and you'll notice if i check my um db connection i can go into workshop or uh the whole path and it actually references that file here so if i were working with a different project different database that's how i would uh specify what my where my secure connect bundle is is um in this file i'm just setting a variable and then calling it um when i actually initialize the driver okay next step so connect your application to cassandra this is that pip install or if you were using a node you're going to do your npm install this is that one that david was talking about earlier i'm just going to go here and i'm going to pip install cassandra driver boom done it worked we are actually requirement is already satisfied did we uh i think we already actually installed the drivers for him dude it might be that's fine um but i didn't see your screen because i wasn't watching you there um yeah yeah no worries i'll take it personally okay um so now we're actually going to go ahead and we're going to start running some operations now the first one i'm going to show you these files and then we're going to run these files in the the readme we don't actually dive into the files but i do want to talk about them a little bit because it is kind of important all we're doing here is we are checking our connector basically running a simple select from system local now system local is a piece of cassandra that is always going to be there um it is an operational table um it's not something you should ever write to manually but we can obviously select something from it so that should work so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to run python uh and then reference that file there um am i not in the right directory pwd real quick oh yeah i need to change the directory so um you are going to need to run cd into the directory you want to go into so i need to go into uh crud let's see crud python and then i should be able to run that same command again and there it is start exercise boom success um and then it closes the connection because again you want to close your connections when you and that's it right that just proved right that basic thing when you get that message back that you are now connected to the cluster that just says okay the basic plumbing is there you've hooked up right so that's where we want to get to right now right now the next thing we've got our insert journey now a journey as we talked about before we're using this kind of spacecraft app right so kind of a mega iot app um we're gonna just start a journey that's basically inserting one setting its value to probably active um and we can actually see here we've got our spacecraft name we've got a journey id we've got active we're actually sending that to false and then our summary is we're bringing astronauts to the international space station pretty simple so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to python exercise 0 3 insert journey and starting exercise and boom success now we don't say to do this in the readme but i'm going to do this just because i want to illustrate something so i'm going to go back into uh astro you don't need to follow along with this this step at all um this is just again me illustrating something for you guys i'm going to go ahead and click my cluster i'm going to hit go ahead and click on cql console notice i'm logged in i'm going to use space craft and i'm going to just do a select star from journey is it spacecraft journeys i think uh spacecraft oh where is it journey catalog that's what's called space craft journey catalog and there it is that data i just inserted using python is now uh referenceable from my cql console so just trying to illustrate again we're not doing any cooking show hand waviness we are actually inserting data we're going to be pulling data out we're going to be modifying data this is actually happening in real time all right going back to it here so exercise number four now david stop me if i get ahead of you if you have any more slides because yeah you're already already ahead but that's okay you're right there it's okay it's okay yeah okay yeah no worries yeah matter of fact let's just i want to see if um let's see i was just checking for a couple in the chats um right and there are some questions they're coming through here let's see yeah so ship i'll ask what to do after the creation of tables at this point not much right if the next sections and that's where we're going to get into when you're creating and updating the records and reading the results and all that um so we should be good from that standpoint okay so hopefully folks are at a point um where you've gotten to what eric just did right where he was able to make the connection to the database um and you see that connected to clustercast cluster because that tells you the plumbing is in place right so then the next section we're popping over to here is section four you should see here for the crate and the update records um so just a couple things once you have established that connection again whether in node you're using the client object or in python you're using the session object right each one of those work the same way you'll notice that if i want to execute a query i'll just say dot execute and then i'll pass in the query now that this is the most basic basic way of doing things matter of fact this is actually a level up from the most basic because it is using a placeholder uh question mark variable there um in this case where you pass that and you could even just paste in a query directly would you ever really want to do this in real code no no that's not an option safe yeah that's not very safe at all right you know because then somebody could if somebody were to hack your code and they could inject something in there they could essentially execute whatever they wanted right so that's generally an anti-pattern why we don't show it here but the point being is at the very very basic level you could just say session.execute pass in the actual query and go right that would be the simplest thing to do um now there are some things especially when dealing with cassandra it's not really optimized for the types of use or the what you would expect in cassandra and cassandra i know that i have a database that can handle many many thousands of operations per second per node right um so there are ways to optimize your queries to make them much more performant especially for subsequent runs right and that's really where prepared statements come into play by the way this is also the same if you're using a relational database right so if you are working with a database and you're not using prepared statements i don't care what language it is or what database generally you should be here's the difference in the case of a simple statement when you actually when when you execute the statement it has to be parsed and compiled that data has to be sent over to the node that's going to run it and all that kind of deal in a prepared statement the only difference is that you only prepare and compile once right a parsing compile sorry once and then you store that it actually gets stored up on the node at that point from a payload standpoint the only thing that's sent over are the actual data for the parameters that you're sending in right it is extreme optimization especially when you're dealing with thousands of operations can you imagine if you had a single query that's being executed thousands of times per second per node right um the amount of overhead that that causes right so that's why you really want to prepare your statements how do you prepare a statement you you you create your statement in a query uh whether it is in a query variable like you see in node um you don't have to call a query you can call it whatever you want but you just create a statement you know in a variable that stores that statement you pass that to client.execute and then you just tell it it's prepared true that's it right now again you'll find in the different languages this is one of those cases where the concept is the same regardless of the language but the syntax might be slightly different where a node syntax because it's it's very i think it illustrates it's just actually going on here yeah it's just different the java looks very similar yeah it's just a difference in the different languages and how they're implemented that's all right um but the all it really comes down to is in in node um you'll see that in your client.execute you pass the query you pass whatever parameters then you just tell prepare is true that's it right in the case of python which i agree with eric it's it's a little simpler you just say session.prepare and you pass the query and then when you go to execute it you pass that prepared object into the dot execute with whatever the parameters are and that's it that is enough right there to get you a solid optimization and prepare your queries okay with that eric please all right let's go all right so we already inserted some data we were using if you'll notice a simple statement and i'll actually jump back to that file real quick um so we ran where is it here do you do session execute there it is insert now we basically just threw some values in there again not injection safe if i had on my my website if i had a field where i took user input and i just tied that to a variable here ran this query i could run some you know one equals one style old school injection attacks and probably actually breach something so don't do that sandra is like any other database there are the same issues you need to to worry about around injection safety and sanitization of data and all of those things prepared statements are the way to use them um sanitize your data use prepared statements like david was saying okay let's do takeoff and which which step do i need to stop on david so i don't know yeah you're doing three and four right now three and four perfect all right so let's go ahead and let's take a look at four now this is where we're actually going to do takeoff so we're going to change this this um upcoming mission to an active mission and what we're doing here if you'll notice we have this update query we've actually defined the query so use spacecraft uh or sorry update uh spacecraft journey catalog set active equals true we're basically just doing an update on that statement we previously had inserted um you'll notice here that i have this prepared update connection session prepare update query so the query we defined up top we're just doing a prepare again that session since we're in python we're using session instead of client um we're doing session.prepare we're preparing that statement it's being compiled and all we're going to do when we execute that is we're going to send the statement id so it gets an id between the driver and then the actual database itself we're going to send that statement id and then the payload of the data so whatever data we wanted to send with it gets sent essentially as a payload and then applied to that pre-prepared statement okay so then we do a connection session execute prepared update so that prepared statement and then we we list off the values there so date time date time now so we're actually using the now function that is actually a python thing um spacecraft name which we've defined up here so uh yeah we've got that there we've got journey id which is a uuid which we've defined uh statically here but we could also have generated that as you know this is going to be the unique uh journey id and we can use a uuid library to actually generate that okay so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to python example 4 take off dot py so go ahead here and success now i do want to just show you guys again just so we we can see that there's no hand waviness um that actually i'm just going to select star from space craft journey catalog and we're going to go ahead and see that look we have now changed the values from before it was set active equals fault it's now set to true we have a spacecraft name the journey id is there all of those things that were not there in our original insert are now in the database so we went and we performed an update so we have now done a c and a u of the crud operation acronym we have two more to go and then we'll get into some other cool stuff all right david i think back to you yeah okay great i'm gonna just finishing up answering something here all right let's go ahead and pop back over okay we're just doing a quick time check okay wonderful all right so hopefully yeah hopefully you guys were able to um kind of follow along with eric again if you do get a little behind it's no big deal all this is meant to be self-service and you can always follow up with us um so now going into the next sections um with three and four you said you just brought them through four right four yeah okay okay um so one of the concepts uh in cassandra that you should be aware of is something called a batch now a batch is not uh for bulk loading data into cassandra right so if you come from the relational world you're used to batch statements and doing them and using them that way that is not what we do with them in cassandra what they are for is keeping multiple denormalized tables in sync so what did that just mean well eric kind of alluded to this way in the beginning when we were talking about the data model if you remember when we had our sensor metrics table right you know like speed temperature pressure location all those looked almost the same right they had the same keys and everything the difference though was in its data payload so some might ask well how do i if i have all these tables that are denormalized how do i keep those in sync when i'm making inserts the batch is the answer right so the batch really all it's saying is hey if i'm gonna like in the example we have here we're actually inserting into all four of our center measure sensor metrics tables at once all it's really saying is um i'm going if any one of these fails i'm going to fail it you know but if any one of these completes that i'm going to guarantee i'm going to complete them all right it's just making sure that if you insert into one you're essentially inserting into all of them and this isn't something that's some hard requirement this is something we're saying in our particular data model in our particular app that we want to do so again if you if you have a set of queries that need to be executed or inserts or updates that need to be executed against a set of denormalized tables that are all using the same key like we have here that's a good use for a batch batches by the way are another place where you definitely want to use prepared statements and notice that you'll see there that the preparer is true now again the syntax a little bit different like node node actually does it a little bit differently than the others python looks a lot more like what you'd see in java um where you have the dot notation access so i'm going to say i'm going to create a batch statement in python and then just say batch.add and then i'm going to add each of those statements now you might be wondering where's my statement right notice how you have prepared insert location prepared insert speed right these were just prepared statements that were created earlier so the statements are stored in those objects prepared insert speed speed insert temperature and then we're just passing the parameters along to it right this would be similar to how i do it in java as well right so again the syntax is slightly different between the two but the concept is the same but that's it that's all you need for a batch so if you ever have a case where you have a set of denormalized tables you want to keep them synchronized you just wrap them in a batch and that's pretty much it from that standpoint now with udts generally speaking you don't have to do anything special with them in code except for python but but um if you're using prepared statements you don't need to register your udts with a cluster instance but if you're not using prepared statements you do need to do a little extra bit of work in python so to me kind of the uh the lesson here is prepare your statements right and you might ask well when won't you prepare if you truly have a query that's only executed once you don't really need to prepare it right but if you have any query that's ever executed more than once you need to prepare it and so really this is just kind of you know an extra bit info because there is this difference we're pointing it out to you you don't absolutely have to do that as long as you're preparing statements okay so with that go for five and six awesome all right let's do it all right so five let's take a look at what we're actually doing here now remember we talked about batches i'm just going to echo something here because i don't think we can say it enough batches are not for data loading they are not a relational batch it's kind of almost an unfortunate naming because they have literally no no parallel um do not use them the same way you would use them in the relational world you will end up in a very bad place your app will not perform and you can actually um i've seen people take notes down doing that so don't do that all right next so what we're going to do here we're going to do our travels so we're actually going to start uh collecting data essentially or we're going to simulate the collection of data right because all this data is fake we aren't actually launching a rocket today that would be ooh that'd be awesome um anyway uh so we've got our prepared statements here we can see we've got insert into spacecraft speed over time all the values insert into temperature over time pressure over time location over time each of those is becoming a prepared statement we're preparing them session prepare so we're actually doing the compile essentially of that what that statement is then we go down here and we have the batch so batch equals batch statement now i could name that batch anything i could name it you know uh batch one i could name it pterodactyl i could name it pretty much anything i want to name that um we're just using batch here to try to be really really explicit and clear with what exactly it is we're doing so batch it equals a new batch statement we're going to add the prepared statement the values so the payload to that um and you notice we're actually defining those values so those aren't just variables we aren't going to modify them later we're actually adding the command we want to run or the uh the operation we want to run to the batch we do that with all the the location speed temperature and pressure and then we do a connection session execute so just like we could execute a single statement or prepared statement we execute a batch exactly the same way we just with that execute and then we put the batch in uh as the parameter so let's go ahead here and we're going to do python ex05 and that is our travel go ahead here and [Music] traveling so we are basically just spoofing a whole bunch of random numbers you'll notice we have actually some code with random ins up here so we're just taking uh random sensor data is all we're doing and we're just spoofing that inserting that and we're running probably oh i i don't know is it a thousand batches yeah a thousand batches um we're gonna run here so um you know i can kill it before it's done here that's that's fine all right it says failure it's not actually failed and i'll actually prove that to you we can go here we can do select star from spacecraft let's do uh what table let's do pressure over time and we see tons and tons of data in there and we can see that the random number generator was indeed generating random pressure numbers now if our pressure was fluctuating that that valid event extremely we'd probably end up exploding something but uh for purposes of the dammo it makes sense all right so next we're going to look at landing now you'll notice what we've done here we are not preparing anything or anything like that we are updating we are setting this journey to uh basically uh no longer active right we've landed we are now at a journey uh status of false so let me go ahead here and python this is nothing new this is everything we've done before so i'm not you know that's why i'm not really digging into it here uh we're just kind of cleaning out what we did zero six landing start exercise and then i'm gonna go in i'm gonna go ahead and verify in my cql console select oops i am in the star from you ever done that where you type commands in the middle of an output it wouldn't be the first time yeah uh journey catalog there we go oops and we'll notice that it is now set you know it's active is set to false um we have accomplished our mission mission success we can all you know pop the champagne we we have successfully flown the rocket so basically all we did there was we just ran an update simple as that nothing nothing crazy all right david i think we are back to you yes back to you all righty okay so all right so with this last you know with the piece that eric just showed you right now we've gone through we've actually run through a journey maybe you've done another one and that is going through the process of creating and updating records right and again again each one of these these snippets that you're running each one of these executions you're doing is just a vignette of okay i want to you know update some data i want to create some data i want to use a batch or whatever so when you're looking for your own references you know that you've got a piece of working code you can take a look they're meant to be very quick and to the point of doing the very operation you know from the from crud right from create read update and delete in this next section now that you've updated your and you've created a bunch of data you've you've created a spacecraft journey now you want to read the results right um so we want to take a look at what does that look like maybe things like if i do a simple select or if i'm doing you know more extensive parsing or if i want a page imagine you have a petabyte data database you probably don't want to be returning the results of all billions of rows in your particular table or something like that whatever you happen to have um this is a brand david yeah right yeah yeah you know like but not only that i mean i think i think paging has been around for quite some time it's very functional especially imagine e-commerce or something if you went to amazon and you know something had a million results you don't want to see all a million you just want to see 10 or 50 or whatever it is the paging is baked right into the drivers it's really really simple to use um especially too in the nature of cassandra where is it distributed asynchronous database you want to do this right well guess what the driver does it for you essentially you just have to use your paging state you're going to get an example of that now and then feel sorry go through all uh through ten oh perfect wonderful all right so what we're gonna do here we're gonna look at list journeys now i kind of cheated and i showed you this exact thing in the cql console that's okay um we're just going to do it manually and we're actually using a where clause here now you'll notice that we're querying off of spacecraft name there's an important little thing we didn't really talk about earlier but where clauses must provide your partition key and any preceding clustering columns you cannot use a where clause off a data column that's actually a good thing it forces us to denormalize and data model correctly so not it not actually uh you know when most people get exposed to cassandra and they instantly try to write aware clause and it doesn't work um they go oh this is a terrible database actually no it's a very very good thing because it forces you to pre-optimize your data and achieve the kind of speeds that you should be getting from the database all right so i'm gonna go ahead and i'm going to run this so python ex07 list journeys now this is just gonna list the one because we just have the one now if i had gone through and i had there it is right there journey there's the id there's the summary um if i had had like 12 journeys here and please experiment with this go create more journeys um you'll need to change out that little uuid line in the insert or i think create insert journey um file you'll need to just set it to dynamically create a uuid because we have one statically defined but you can go through and you can literally just create 50 of these and this will list them out you'll be able to see um everything you put in there basically okay let's go to the next one so in read journey this is where it gets kind of cool so what we're doing is we're saying okay we know what the the idea of that journey is right that uuid we just printed that out right here we can see what that is we're going to go ahead and we are going to uh query based off that so notice uh spacecraft name and we've also added journey id to our where clause so that journey id is now going to return um all that information so i'm going to go ahead here and i'm going to execute pi fun x08 read journey start exercise and there we go we got a summary we got all sorts of information basically the same stuff will return from cql but obviously formatted nicely because we went into python and made it format in a nice little report so we have our id we have the spacecraft we have the summary the status landing takeoff the times all that stuff is created for us pretty cool all right and since we're we're just going to keep on going i'm going to go to read metrics read metrics is where we actually get to freeze up there we go read matrix there we go um read metrics is where we actually get to start looking at some more more tables so the the pressure speed all of those things that's where we're gonna actually start interacting with those so i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna run this and then i'll talk through it because it's probably a little a little more clear to do it that way zero nine read metrics so we're going to see what it fits out here in just a moment all of those values from the different uh lines that we had generated remember we had those random number generators all those values are got spit out here we have the id so that's the actual um record number or the identifier was all we were using we're just using an incrementing number for each individual um time we're inserting data we have a time stamp which you can see those are indeed um ascent error ascending descending uh no i'll send it goodness um and then we have our values which again we're a random number which um with a little bit of logic in there to make it uh increment correctly so really really cool uh we are able to you know print out our data we would be able to if we were trying to do some analytics on this stuff and actually look at a journey a specific journey and and mine it for some data we could go through and we could a query for multiple tables do any data operations at this point you know personally being a python user i'd probably be using panda loading up some data frames and doing all sorts of manipulation on it um but we're at the point where it's now up to you as the language user to go forth and actually use this data so really really cool stuff last one here read metrics with paging now paging is exactly what david said it was paging allows you to get a subset of the data returned so if i only want the first 10 results from you know my table but then i'm going to want the next 10 then i'm going to want the next 10. for example if you were on like netflix and you you see the you know suggested for you panel and you can click left or right and it shows you the results um from their database create that's actually what they're doing they're paging and they're returning the results um from that particular page so when you click next it returns the next whatever like four or five ten results however many you have displayed there that's exactly what we're going to be doing here so let's go ahead and take a look at the code what i've got is i've got my connection i've got my query okay so this query is exactly the same as the query from the last one we're just selecting uh a spacecraft from spacecraft speed over time where spacecraft name is one thing journey id is one thing boom our statement we're just doing a simple statement we're not really we're not doing prepared statements obviously as david said before please please use prepared statements basically everywhere it's what you should be doing all right um then we're gonna do where is it here are offset uh did you do output items ah i lost my place here one moment please um paging exception david where'd it go where's my flag oh there yeah oh sorry i wasn't watching your screen eric i'm not answering questions over here i was totally i literally highlighted the thing i was looking for so what what happens when you run a paging query is basically it will return a pointer that then you can resubmit um and it will return the next set the driver will retrieve the next set of data so you don't need to store this hole in ram and then iterate through it you're basically saying send me the first 10 records and send me the pointer to where we stopped at and i'm going to consume those next 10 records and then i'm going to send back that pointer so you can send me the next 10 records in this particular case i do we reset yeah fetch size is 10. so fetch shot is default i believe is 2 000 um is it is it 2000 or 5000 damage do you remember defaults 5000 i believe 5 000. okay yeah so fetch size default 5000 this particular case we're doing 10 um and if i were to run this python yeah yes and cedric just confirmed that too yeah it's 5000. perfect oops 10 readmetrics paging we are going to then return we return 10 items now in this particular case we don't ever resend our our uh query we don't send that offset back but if i wanted the next 10 items i could just you know write another i could basically throw a loop in my code here and just have it resend that uh that offset and just get my next 10 items my next 10 items my next 10 items and it would work that's what paging is it's actually an incredibly powerful tool it's used in all sorts of places once you understand what paging is um you're gonna go you're just browsing online you're gonna look at things and realize that oh my facebook feed or my uh instagram feed is actually using paging as well you know how it has a show more button at the bottom there that's actually paging as well paging literally is everywhere anywhere where you need a subset of data and then you want to show more eventually it cuts down on load times it increases efficiency it is a huge huge tool all right let's see here i think i'm basically done that was uh section 10. so i'm going to hand it back off to david and we can get going here all righty all righty excellent well just a couple things to rack up uh with everyone today we always try to keep these in time i did mention at the very beginning that we're going to give you some resources i have a couple of slides on there so so there are so many of you came in brand new to cassandra um and asking a lot of questions especially some about the cassandra fundamentals and data modeling go to datastax.com this link that you see up here in the top um absolutely do that why because there you'll actually be provided with i mean a whole set of coursework that's actually embedded in your browser it uses a technology called catacotta if you've ever used catacota it's from o'reilly it's free it's awesome so what'll actually happen is you spin one of these things up and it actually spins up a constant instance for you in the cloud why that's cool um because not everybody has a laptop that can run cassandra on its own right it'll even hook you up to astra do all of that um and then you do all the exercises there at your own pace right there in the browser it is seriously cool stuff and there's all sorts of there's there's a whole set i'm trying to remember how many um there are for the cassandra fundamentals but if you want to get those kind of answers like well you know how does replication work you know what is consistency level i saw a question about consistency level earlier what are all those things like you know it'll answer all those in the fundamentals then the data modeling right if you want to go a lot deeper into the stuff we talked about today with data modeling go there but there's even more right there's kafka integration um i'm trying to remember some of the other ones i might be forgetting off the top of my head but there's a ton so go check it out yeah yeah and then um also separate from discord right we have our community so if you go to community.datastacks.com that's a great place it's like stack overflow for cassandra right so not only do you get access to other um cassandra experts people that are outside of data sex people who've been running these things on their own um but you have it's a great platform for if you've got longer form questions you need to add some screenshots or or whatever you're looking for you know a deeper answer that's a really great place to go um so sometimes you'll notice that us on discord we might point you there on purpose for some questions because it's just a it's a better medium for them we are on youtube we're on twitter we're on twitch connect with us connect with us wherever um we are happy on linkedin right we are we are happy to take your questions and if you have follow-up or whatever that's always good to know again the exercises the workshop itself is at the github repo that's down there in the bottom um and some homework so you're in fact going to use datasex.com dev for your homework um so for those of you who are gonna join us next week and please do right you should absolutely join us next week because we have more coming for you take a look at this stuff these are some of the courses that we're talking about again this stuff is all free so you'll see the links there and these will now get you a little deeper into some of the stuff that we just covered right you notice that driver quickstarts getting into cql building arrest service all that stuff is done right there in in in the website embedded and then if you're going to come with us for next week get ready for week two then take a look at those links that you see down there at the bottom for cloud native and kubernetes awesome all right and then certifications so certifications um you know for those of you who are looking maybe to level up your career a little bit um the the cassandra certifications right now um actually can can translate into real money right there's actually a shortage of people who can administrate and work with cassandra databases out there and what's crazy about it is that the demand for cassandra is is very clearly there right so getting these certifications is definitely something that you can put on your resume something you can put out there in the social world let people know you've done this what's really cool is that by attending this series and for those who apply and you'll register to the three episodes that we're gonna have we're going to give you a voucher at the end right that voucher is good the tests normally cost 145 each the voucher will give you two attempts now what that translates into is you could actually say you want to do the developer certification and you pass it well now you have attempt left over you could use for the admin certification or if for some reason you didn't pass it now you have another attempt free of charge right um so this is something we're giving to you as a thank you for coming here with us and is definitely something that can help level up your game and what's what's also neat with that is if you do choose to go down the certification path again go to slash dev certifications you'll actually go through a whole set of course work on the fundamentals and data modeling and admin and such that will answer all of the questions that you might very well have on uh cassandra itself and with that thank you so much i am just uh the registration link please let's see oh okay i see jack just dropped a link okay all right wonderful so again thank you everybody thank you so much for joining us today uh we definitely want to see you next week and again if you have any follow-up questions or whatever hit us up in discord come over there talk to us or hit us on the compute community we'll be watching um so if you do run in into any troubles or anything come let us know otherwise enjoy your database and happy coding thank you everyone later and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops imagine a being gifted with powers from the goddess of cassandra who grew those powers until she could multiply it will move with limitless speed and unmask hidden knowledge with those powers she was able to fully understand the connectedness of the world what she saw was a world in need of understanding from that day forward she sought to bestow her powers on all who came into contact with her empowering them to achieve wondrous beats",
