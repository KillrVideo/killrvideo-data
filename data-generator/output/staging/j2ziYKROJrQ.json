Cassandra at kubernetes I interviewed a lot of experts most of the more outside of data stacks but in one case I talked to Chris Bradford who is also an employee of data stacks now he has a special opinion because he's actually a product manager for our kubernetes part of our business he's been a consultant he's worked on our product side he has a well-rounded opinion and so when he and I got to talking about kubernetes in Cassandra it was much more about the actual product so there was some really cool insights into like how kubernetes got to where it is and how it got to where it is with Cassandra and really about the future and it's a different way of looking at it I thought the full version would be helpful and useful to everyone if you saw it so here it is in its full form I hope you enjoy it so kubernetes seems to be the People's Choice for deploying applications now so why do you think that is I mean this is now a thing so kubernetes is pretty amazing when it comes to deploying applications and making scaling pretty effortless I think it came out of the fork paper at Google and even if you don't have a hyper scope problem or application you still have planned for that kind of thing and and and what scaling looks like and so as we talk about scaling applications specifically stateless and it's really a nice it's the match between like the peanut butter to the chocolate it's a really good fit for those kinds of technologies and it's it's pretty turnkey if your application is stateless and usually the application tier is to use kubernetes and to scale pretty effortlessly with us stateless the key here with applications and kubernetes it was for a long time and if you ask me this question a number of years ago well can we run Cassandra or databases on kubernetes I would have been like oh you really should do that it's been interesting to see how it grows and that's one of the things that previously if you had asked about whether or not you can run a stateful application if everything in your stack who was already using cookies you had all your tooling in place you're monitoring your logging and you're probably already a pretty advanced shop at that point you know maybe you can look at it for that kind of use case but for most use cases is it required a deep understanding of the components inside of kubernetes and the resources that it exposed and you had to kind of carefully navigate these those waters and kubernetes the computer for native community and developers got together and said you know what we really want to be like the platform and it doesn't make sense to just target stateless have applications that's not how you kind of grow and in this space obviously we can do that well but there are other kinds of workloads that have an appetite to run on kubernetes and how can we solve that and so they introduced new components like stateful sets and persistent volumes and persistent like clean use to describe the pieces that you need to have to to operate with stateful applications on kubernetes and so as those have matured our stance and and really any one stance when it comes to Romeo state qualification opportunities has changed pretty significant and so rather than saying no you really don't wanna do that or you really have to understand an X Y and C it's more of a yeah you can definitely do that this is the component view and here's why it's a good fit so mean that frame like what what happened with databases while you know the application tier was getting all the kubernetes love along the way it's been interesting and it depends on the type of databases that you look at right one of the things I think is pretty fascinating about Cassandra and and how it has operated of sitri Sherita system it has a bunch of these components that you need to be effective in a distributed system so look at things like gossip and doing discovery and health checks and saying are these nodes up or they don't need to route another way in my NS split-brain scenario like all that's been kind of in the core if Cassandra since day one and we're seeing the applications and frameworks on kubernetes start to hit on those points as well you see it outside of Cassandra like you look at elixir and Erlang they kind of had some of those components built in you know akka as well but we're seeing it more in the application layer now whether you're looking at servers meshes on top of kubernetes like sto and liquor DB or even just some of these these components that are part of the platform itself so when I talk about gossip you have things like right eNOS and health checks built in to congr and ease at a platform level not just within a framework and so that's kind of how applications on and over over time to become more cloud native and then when we look at she redid systems or distributed databases like Cassandra we see some very common parallels between the two and they're all kind of clean playing good metal versus in the past for like oh well we have gossip to handle detecting if we can't talk to another anymore or we support multi region replication out of the box or we have this idea of failure zones built into the database layer well we're also starting to see that an application now and that's that's been pretty fascinating and really validating if you will to see this those kinds of changes happen where before it was kind of okay of a application instance went down because you could just take a load balancing pool and your output stay up as we get into more complex setups where your routing geographically riding based on where you are geographically to the data center or based off of latency or different lengths that kind of thing it's tricky right and you see a lot of these components come up to the mainstream come up to the front and be first-class citizens versus hidden away inside of the database layers really nice so I think into just as it goes with open source projects whenever there's a good idea a lot of things you know there's a lot of energy around it so now we have a lot of kubernetes operators for Cassandra and so do you think at this point there is a place for comm I'm an operator or will they'll always be multiple operators sure and that's a great question when I think about operators there are a few different things that they try to solve right and the whole idea is to make it easier to deploy an application on top of kubernetes and an operator needs to be able to speak the kubernetes side and and the the application domain side in this case let's talk about Cassandra I me to be able to describe a Cassandra cluster to kubernetes fair to the operator and then the operator described that in the resources and components that that committee speaks and so is there a place for Mel offerings well I think that you have different missions right a lot of people there's a common mission which is I want to run Cassandra I'm Cooper Nettie's but then there's also how do we go about doing that do we have any specific implementation details that are unique to our environment or maybe we have certain compliance concerns mm-hmm so it would be very short-sighted of me to say no there's one Operator to rule them all and in the darkness bind them right but it's very much a what's your use case and if they offer is open source well that's fascinating I'd love to see people I'd love to see an operator that's extendable to support many different use cases and workloads and target 80% of the Cassandra deployments out there I still think there are going to be some other deployments where it's not necessarily possible or there are certain requirements that don't allow that specific operator to be used but it would also be nice for it to be a jumping-off point if you do have to make your mhm yeah and having it closer aligned with the project is helpful I think yeah yeah oh well so what do you think is it what are the important features of a kubernetes operator like and the most important things like what's the must-have for a kubernetes operator for Cassandra sure so a kubernetes operator for cassandra has to understand like I said before the it has to understand the business domain or the sorry the application domain of Cassandra so there are some concepts that I think may be baked into it from the get-go and what I'd like to call table stakes and if I'm looking at open source Cassandra or any Cassandra really and I'm thinking hmm what are the tenants for running a successful cluster in the space am I looking at this needs to be multi region and do geographic geolocation of data or do I need to support multiple data centers from a workload isolation perspective when we start working on kubernetes it likes to do things like reuse IP addresses and inside of the core of Cassandra we talk about IP address the supports overlay is Canadian it's like I really like hostname so I could change the IP zhan as I see fit and it'd be nice to see some of the bridging between those what the requirements look like for each of those technologies so table stakes I think you have a multi region support and that's non-trivial if you look at what is happening in the multi region or multi cluster space for kubernetes they're very tricky they like to say okay well just deploy the same resources and all these other clusters and then you wrap traffic to the appropriate cluster and you're good to go and if we were a stateless application yeah sure that'd be super easy we could just go on with our days but we're a stateful application and we need to replicate between us regions and it gets a lot ah hairy earlier there right so we have to do things like quorum across multiple regions we have to make sure that pods within the network can then communicate between clusters so there's there are a number of pieces there the things that I think is table stakes as well as when you start talking about connectivity to the Cassandra cluster if you are running your application within kubernetes and you're talking to a Cassandra Clare server running within the same kubernetes cluster that's pretty easy you just say okay here's my service and if one set all my pods in a way we care and we're happy but what if you have a legacy application or application that exists outside of that Cabrini's class what if you have an application in a separate kubernetes cluster how do you handle that discovery and communication across boundaries is it simple where you just have the superflat network and every container can talk to every other container or you more security focus you have different rules in place what does that look like and yeah I think any operator that is going to operate in this space needs to understand we don't always have the simple use case of oh they just talk to it we're good to go it might be a little bit more nuanced than that and to speak to the different use cases or missions of your cluster or requirements of your environment you might have a centralized logging system for your enterprise and yeah you know you how you plug into that the operator should allow you to do things like say I use this kind of logging system how do I or how can I describe that to the operator so it gets plugged into all the Cassandra pods or I might have some auditing tool that that needs to do something like it's kind of fascinating when you start to dig into some of the use case specific implementations but you can see like with logging like we just discussed I mean that's centralized logging is awesome them but how you do centralized logging there's there's a handful of different ways you can do that and do you do that with a separate key inside of your custom resource or do you make it so you can kind of plug in what you need so that but that's one of the things I think is worth taking into mind as you start to filled out in operators how can we support some of these varied deployments while still applying things like best practices high availability and all that that comes with Cassandra out of the box it's yeah the leveling the leveling for the consent for the kubernetes operator is a good guideposts I think like the level one two three four or five where do you fit in this you know I definitely think level three is a minimum of just being able to do lifecycle management but there's some parts of level 5 for instance horizontal scaling which I think that comes with it yeah I've been very happy to see so operator hub is website where you can get operators for different technologies and they have a five-point scale before how mature is your operator and that's very fascinating work and just be like I install things and you're done or it can be proactive such as I monitor your instances and I see that one of them went down and I can make sure that we start one up or if there's writing between starting different instances that's this kind of fastening we talked about this Andrew you don't store all the notes at one table maybe have a Buster you have to say okay we'll be certain these notes first these 10sec and it's third and an operator some of the more interesting upper block operators will handle all that timing for you all right so what about the future so if we're gonna we're gonna get some levels some usable level of communities operated with Cassandra so what kind of new use cases does that enable what does it what does the future hold for us so it's interesting as we start to think about the logical concept of the Cassandra cluster or Cassandra data center and talking to an operator it's almost like a conversation right is it I need a cluster with this capacity or to fit these kinds of ability constraints I think it's it's kind of fascinating to see that kind of sprout that's but that's like putting the seeds in the ground but we want to talk about what's what this garden look like and there are a number of operators out there not just for Cassandra but for complement technology so we talked about logging you can also do monitoring you can do backup solutions you can do in the case of Cassandra free of repairs and so that's kind of interesting how can we as an operator enable those other technologies as well whether that's with the Disco's of our cluster or talking directly to other operators and be more of a like a mesh to say okay I need an enterprise deployment of Cassandra what does that look like well it's not just running Cassandra you have repairs backups monitor logging there's all these other pieces that could lend to it and maybe your operator doesn't control all of those things but maybe it enables the use of other operators or other components to do this and that's where I think our future state is it's it's turnkey in a way that we kind of saw with the the rise of cloud players we can say this is what I'm looking for and all of that automation happens for you and cognitively you can focus on your application or your business needs and think less about what order do I start these news and again or did I run the backup what's the schedule for that look like or we're getting ready to change our logging solution this is going to be awful like it would be really nice to not have to have that cognitive load that cognitive burden and just be like okay we can do that and get on with the more interesting parts of our day I really love the concept of reducing cognitive burden I think this is this is gonna be crisis level if we don't we don't really have a hard think about how we do infrastructure and how we what we put on developers it's getting in the way of progress definitely and I I think about I used to work in a network operations center and I think about the long nights where it was super early in the morning and the reporting jobs would kick off in the database servers would get super hot as they were getting queried for for mattress collection generator for it sound like man I remember being where I am and those servers still being bright red and having to start waking people up and I think about operators specifically kubernetes operators and it's always watching it's always monitoring whether it's the reporting hour or it's a a physical worker died and I need to mediate the time between monitoring picking it up and the humans seeing that monitoring pick it up and then remedial action and take in and all the further downstream events can be significantly shortened is is fantastic so I love to put my operator hat on when I started thinking about distributed systems in Kassandra well it's kind of awful to think about some of the things that we had to automate and do to get it usable and robust and we're next leveling that every single week it feels like now with with the automation that's coming that would be a really cool future to see Cassandra being it just it's an easy thing to work with working with kubernetes makes it so that it's just an easy thing to say you can go to queue control deploy and done don't have to worry about it I think you did enables a whole new class of workflows as well I really like this whole CIC D pipeline and I'd loved it to developers as they really out their schema and say okay this is schema you want to roll with this is what you've checked in let's go ahead and spin up a cluster let's run some data against that let's see what your performance looks like let's see what your data size looks like on disk with C XY and Z and make sure that you're checking off all these boxes is you do that Roche production versus oh we just hit production and we didn't account for this education of that is education it's all blowing up on us I'd love to see this continuous data platform kind of come into existence and I think with the right tooling in place you can leverage it and make that happen I think you're right I see it and I think a lot of other people will see it that's why you see all this activity around operators early this is the future we all want it deserve this is definitely Chris Bradford is what am I go to people and now you see why he has so much information than he can offer every time I talk to my word a little bit more and whenever I get really stumped or I have problems with Cassandra and kubernetes and trying to figure out how things are working together a quick zoom called Chris and things are cleared up right away so thanks again to Chris for joining me on this I hope you enjoyed this episode and we'll talk again soon thanks for listening to the distributed data show please subscribe with your favorite podcast",
