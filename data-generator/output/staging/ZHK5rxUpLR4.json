    "text": "[Music] conceptually an ordering traversal is very simple it arranges objects in a traversal stream into an ordered sequence it's going to take objects in and apply some known criteria we give it and then emit the objects one by one in their new order it is a very important thing to do and it's also a pretty simple thing to set up we only have one new step and that is order the really important thing in the order step is of course its modulator buy we have to specify what we want to sort on and whether we're going to sort on an increasing order which is the default or decreasing order and if we have a map if we want to sort on the keys or the values we also have the option of shuffling basically applying a random ordering to the objects in the traversal stream and order itself has an optional scope the default is global where the ordering computation is applicable to the whole traversal stream which applies the computation to each collection type object in the traversal stream so we will use local scope with a collection in an upcoming example the distinction between global and local can be a little tricky so hopefully the examples help to make it a little more clear as always here's our killer video movie schema we have users who know other users users rates movies and movies belong to genres we also have people in our graph who acted directed composed or other types of activities in the creation of the movies in all of these examples we will be studying the movies by nicholas cage in the first line we find the nicholas cage person vertex and then we are going to traverse the incoming actor edge which will bring us to all of the movies in which nicholas cage has acted next we will order the movies by year decreasing we do this so that we can get an ordered collection of nicholas cage movies with the newest movie first and the oldest movie last but for convenient display let's convert them to a value map with just the year and the title properties in the map so we see that the most recent film in our data set is national treasure book of secrets from 2007 and then ghostwriter also from 2007 and so on down the list now in that previous example we hadn't applied any specific ordering to the films that were from the same year in some applications it might be useful to apply an ordering for those films that are from the same year some actors can release more than one film in the same year now we will call the buy modulator again we will first order by year decreasing and then by title increasing by being specific about the order we see that the movies from 2007 are now reordered by title next how about ordering the movies by their rating in this example we want to now order these movies by their average rating in decreasing order here again we start with nicholas cage and traverse out to all of the movies he acted in next we want to order them by their rating but to do that we have to put a traversal in the buy modulator since we are at a movie we need to go backwards against the edge with the rated label to get the rating values off of those edges then we calculate the mean of this collection of values and specify that we want to do this in decreasing order next we just want to look at the year and title of these movies next we just want to look at the year and title of these movies in decreasing order by their rating as we see here the highest rated nicholas cage film is leaving las vegas next let's do something a little bit more complex let's say we want to limit the universe of ratings to those that are positive we'll define that as being say a 5 or above then we want to order the movies by the average age of the people rating them so broadly speaking these are the people who had a favorable impression of the movie and we want to know well how old were they we start with nicholas cage go through the actor edges to get to the movies and we need to order them by again again we have a traversal here within the buy modulator at this point in the traversal we are currently at the movies so we go back across the rated edge that has a rating greater or equal to five so that traversal gives us only positive readings now we are on the edges so we have to go to the outbound side of this edge to access the user vertex from here let's get the age value calculate the mean and order in increasing order we have specified that we only want highly rated movies and we want to order them by the average age of the people who did the rating and we get results that are not too surprising we see that the two national treasure movies did well mostly among young people since we were ordering by the age of the people who did the rating in the next example we want to apply shuffle but looking at a random ordering is a little hard to see on a slide so let's just look at the code again we start with the nicholas cage person vertex and we get to all of his related movies then we order by shuffle and output the value map now if you actually run this code it'll give you a different ordering each time it is completely random which might be useful for your application finally let's take a look at cage's productivity in each year that he has released films within this sample data to do this we want to get a count of the number of movies he has acted in in each year we start by finding nicholas cage walking over to his movies and then we want to group count these movies by year we will find all of the distinct years and count the number of distinct vertices in each year if you would like to print the objects in this map in order we will need to order the keys decreasing now let's look at the use of the local scope in this last line which is really important the object we have at the end of group count by year is a map the keys in that map are years the values in the map are counts the number of movies made in each year that map is just a map it is not ordered we would like to order it and we would like that ordering to apply to the map that is to a collection type so the ordering has to be local specifying local means do the ordering inside the collection and not among all of the objects in the stream and that local ordering of the map should be by key remember the keys of the map are years so we want by key decreasing most recent movies first and the least recent movies last and we see in 2010 that we have one movie and in 1984 we also had one it looks like 1997 and 2007 were his most productive years with two movies each it lets you do some pretty powerful things as you have seen in these examples so dig into this example exercise and see how you do",
