  "description": "Benchmarking and stress testing are important exercises that both operators and developers do regularly. When it comes to mission critical infrastructure like Apache Cassandra™, benchmarking your data models should be standard practice, especially before going to production. Many previous benchmarking tools haven't made this process easy. At DataStax we recently open-sourced NoSQLBench, a tool that aims to provide sophisticated and performant benchmarking with Apache Cassandra™ and other NoSQL tech while not requiring a PHD to do so.\n\nJoin our workshop to get an introduction and some hands-on experience with the NoSQL Bench benchmarking tool, and leave ready to execute your own (much simpler) performance benchmarking!\n\nWhat to expect:\n- Understand parameters and key metrics for benchmarking\n- How cycles, bindings and statements work together\n- Experimenting with stdout\n- How to scale up a test and customize your own scenarios\n- Packaging a performance test with named scenarios\n\n❓Join us on DISCORD for questions and FUN\nhttps://discord.gg/U4hFGvC\n\n📥 Materials for today is ;\nhttps://github.com/DataStax-Academy/nosqlbench-workshop-online\n\n☁️ Create your AstraDB instance:\nhttps://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online#3-create-your-astra-instance",

    "text": "and hello and welcome everybody to this cassandra developer workshop uh i am david jones gilardi and this is for no sql bench with cassandra i will be your presenter today and i'm joined by a whole cadre of folks um some that you may know if you've been to our workshops before uh we have eric zietlow cedric lundvan alexander velechniff and our community manager jack fryer uh and we have a whole host of other folks from datasex with us today as well not to mention we also have you don't see him on here but he's here the wizard our wizard today jonathan shukinator shooky shooky there cool can you guys the the question i have for folks um is can you hear shooky can you hear shooky hey way i see you waving can i get a thumbs up if you guys can hear a wizard bestow knowledge upon us wizard chooky and i'll be here to answer questions and help david out as as he wants so uh just let us know if you can hear me all righty let's see i did i did increase your getting better okay so i can just i'll just bring yours up for that and i'll make sure to put down for the time yeah and i'll i'll speak a little louder too okay very well okay so by the way with this um one thing i would like to start with today uh just kind of appreciating everybody coming on here and joining us today for this workshop there's a lot going on right now between cover 19 and and some of the things we have going on um with the protests here in the united states uh and data stacks does support we we want to be very clear that we support the black community and we support and and have their voice with regard to um the you know the things in the protests and what's going on right now so again i appreciate everybody showing up today and and being here in lieu of everything that is going on so what are we going to get into today right so here's just the general list first thing is if you've ever been to one of these workshops before you probably would have noticed uh we always have an initial like housekeeping setup kind of a routine even though we designed these so you don't really have to download things your local machines or whatever and we have that same kind of setup today um there are some things that we need to do so we're going to go through getting everybody set up because that way when we get to the exercises later we have a nice smooth experience then we're going to get into the what and why of nosql bench right um and some of you who are familiar with benchmarking or if you are familiar with various other tools you may not know about nosql bench we want to introduce you to it let you know how to get it and then explain like you know the what and why of not only nosql bench but why you need to benchmark why is that so important then we're going to get into how do you in a basic level execute some commands right we're going to step through we're going to do these in both the online scenarios or if you do them locally so you can kind of get a feel for how nosql bench works then i think one of my favorite sections is the dashboarding section with grafana and prometheus um for anyone who's ever done any kind of performance work before performance benchmarking whatever it's important to be able to visualize the data that you're getting and be able to understand what's going on there um the folks at nosql bench have done an excellent job of making this extremely easy to get going without having to worry about hooking up all the underlying plumbing of not only getting your metrics out but then pulling that into a visual a visual data system as well and then finally we're going to wrap up with some custom workloads one of the goals i have for this workshop today is not to just introduce you to nosql bench and talk about why you need that and all that but then also leave you with something so you can start to take no nosql bench and use it with your own data model right so by the end of this workshop the end of our two hours my goal is that you'll be dangerous enough to start using nosql bench with your own workloads and then we'll wrap up with some resources and such now one thing i do want to preface today anyone here who has done anything with benchmarking um you probably know that you can get into a deep rabbit hole very quickly with with benchmarking just the topic in itself right so what we're not doing today is we're not going to jump into that particular hole we are going to keep things pretty high level right and skim the surface uh we were kind of joking about this when we were creating the workshop that we could probably have multiple full-on eight-hour workshops to get into all the depth you possibly could go there so the depth is there but today like i said we're going to start at the beginning level and we're going to scratch the surface of what you can do okay so for the housekeeping and setup portions let's take a look so for those of you who have been to our previous workshops before um you usually are familiar with us doing like a cassandra primer yes this workshop is no sql bench with cassandra but we're not going to do the primer today but don't worry about it right we're going to use the whole time to really just get into a sql bench but all of the steps everything that you need to do is completely spelled out step by step and as a matter of fact if you're using the catacota scenarios which i'll get to in a moment or if you're using the local docker setup the cassandra end of it is totally handled for you anyway right so this is really a focus on nosql bench and what you can do with it not so much on the cassandra piece um so again we will bring you step by step through things you don't have to worry about the xander stuff so much okay so a little bit more on the setup if you're watching this now you're probably already on one of our streams on twitch or youtube but let's go ahead and make sure that we are dropping those into the channel here i'm gonna drop them in there you go there's some links just in case you need those and let's go ahead and get those over to our friends and youtube as well again if you're already watching it that's kind of funny for me to drop the links but just to be sure and i see that acknowledge it wonderful then if you notice up in the top right hand side there we have our catacota so even though i do have it set up so you can run these all locally in your machine this is completely self-contained up in catacota and this is the recommended approach i really recommend for today that you go to catacota we're gonna do that in a moment and you go through the exercises there if you're not familiar with catacota it is a service from o'reilly this is free by the way you're gonna have to sign up but it's it's totally free and there are so many great resources out there that really help kind of bring you through various technology and we're going to do that and then if you're not in the discord already if you take a look there you should see a link to the discord please go to the discord and join us there on the main chat this is the main way to interact with our team um so this is kind of the place that i'm gonna have an eye on waiting for questions or anything like that so again go to the discord to interact with us there and then finally um we'll have a github repository matter of fact i'm going to drop that right now into the discord boom there you go this will be the repository that we're going to work out of today again all of the exercises all the materials if you want to do this on mac oss i'm sorry os x or linux with um the nosql bench binary the jar there's all sorts of different ways to do it it's all up there in the github repository so i absolutely encourage you guys to go take a look at that okay so now let's take a look at the what and why of nosql bench simply stated as it says here on the screen nosql bench is a serious performance testing tool for the nosql ecosystem now again like i mentioned we're just going to scratch the surface of what you can do today we want to just get going and get started right and even though for this particular workshop we're talking no sql bench with cassandra something i want to point out it is called nosql bench not cassandra bench and what that implies is that you can actually plug it into all sorts of other things which is exactly how it's been built right so except for cassandra you have things like data sex enterprise you have jsx astro which is our managed cassandra platform in the cloud but then also things like there's a kafka driver there's a mongodb driver you can do things over web with http or tcp there's all sorts of other little ways that you can plug and hook and talk to no sql bench and matter of fact shooky um i know this is something near and dear to you one thing i'd like to encourage everybody on here today is no sql bench is is open source right data sex has put that out it's totally open source and if you were looking for other drivers this is not an exhaustive list but we are also looking to you in the community to let us know what are you looking to connect to um maybe you're interested in doing a pr or something yeah shooky is there anything else you want to add as far as the plugability in the in the drivers here yes so the way that we've built the sql bench over time has been specifically to allow us to integrate different kinds of workloads and protocols it's evolving but it works pretty well if you want to do an integration or you have a request for specific type of integration please let us know if anybody wants to contribute at any level we're going to be really uh eager about helping you and facilitating that so that that includes mentoring code reviews things like that so just just keep an open mind and if you're interested come to the project and help us out and we'll try to make it as fun and and easy as possible awesome thank you and i do see a question here by esquimar does it support cosmos db um i don't think that we have an official support request in for that okay but no reason it couldn't no no reason it couldn't uh as long as it's a protocol we already speak it should be supported but you know even even the front-end protocols being the same the back-end behaviors sometimes have certain quarks we have to deal with so without testing it i don't want to say yes right so the capability is there that it could be added in right but it's i mean because again the system is built so it's pluggable and you can add whatever in but we don't have an existing driver for it today correct okay cool cool all right all right so i just want to point that out about it all right so getting now into the why why benchmark right um and this might seem like an obvious question to some if you've already been doing benchmarking but i don't think it is right so if you think about it you've done at this point you've probably done all sorts of wonderful work on your data models right what you don't though want to have happen is with some increased load or unexpected spikes or something like that to have your database turn into a truck fire just rolling down the street with no one to stop it right this has happened i have totally seen this happen in my career where systems simply could not keep up and you know things like right now especially with all of us being online we're actually hearing from a lot of companies today that are saying it is black friday every day i mean just think about that for a moment where if you were a company that usually had one day a year that you had to worry about with black friday and now they are getting so much increased load from all of the folks being online and doing all their shopping online and that kind of deal that that that's kind of a big deal so you need to be able to understand not just your data model but how does your data model perform what happens let's say that you change your data model let's say your career access patterns evolve over time they all do how do you know what the performance characteristics of the previous example to then what you're moving to look like do you have enough headroom in your database to be able to handle you know growth or handle viral loads or spikes that come in stuff like that so it is extremely important to be benchmarking your data models to ensure that you do not run into a scenario where your database now it's not just cassandra it could be any database where because your database essentially is not you know falling down on its knees um shooky you have anything you want to add to that on why the benchmark i know this is something dear near to your heart so i want to make sure that you get your piece here well i'll just say that if you go into production without understanding the behavior of your system as it scales and how it performs the data models you're you're really just uh you're gambling and that that's for any system uh client to server uh any database so it's really it's an imperative it's operational imperative it's it's due diligence uh it may be okay for uh operators that are very experienced with a particular database just to scale and manage in situ meaning as they go as they learn to look the signals in the metrics that's an operational discipline that uh frankly takes years to to get good at so uh for everyone else and that includes those who are operationally conservative you need to do testing and and if you don't do it you're taking chances so we want to make that as easy as possible there's there's no there's no way to take some anecdotal or somewhat related information and take that to the bank so you you just need to know and and we want to we want to reduce the friction from uh the point where you say i need to test this data model on the system today and actually getting results and that's what today's all about yeah right yeah exactly and something else i'd like to add as well we're not going to really get into it today but i just want to throw it out there is that nosql bench you could totally plug this right into your ci cd pipeline right so as you're iterating as your data models are evolving you know and if you've got a ci cd pipeline then you can just very kick you can kick off no sql bench with really you know really sophisticated scenarios that can go through the whole life cycle of your application and then explore what those new access patterns look like in as your data model has evolved and that means that you can just hook this up in a very automated way so as you're moving through you're automatically getting those tests and you know you're you know that you have the comparison component from what it looked like before and what it looks like now um so it makes it really easy to kind of hook up that way so a lot of the existing tools there are benchmarking tools that have been out there it's not like no sql bench just came about the first performance benchmarking tool that has ever existed or something like that there's plenty of others but the the big difference here is that a lot of them usually took a lot of esoteric knowledge uh and they could be very terse you'd have to get into a lot of code to even get going with them and no sql bench has been designed even though it has the depth it absolutely has the depth and the characteristics to be able to do just about anything you want in the performance benchmarking world i will definitely give shooky a moment at some point to talk about that but it has been designed to make it very very easy to get up and going within minutes and even get visual metrics and everything um this example you see here if you look at the terminal that i have on the bottom screen you're going to do this in just a moment actually but you know that you see that java if you can see it right here where i'm kind of moving my mouse right you see this alone this one command is running a whole workload that is actually implementing my schema it's ramping up my data it is running through all of my access patterns in in my reads and writes that my app would have it's spinning out console and it's also giving me metrics to docker in like a couple configuration parameters it's super easy to get going that's kind of the point right so with that let's go ahead and go into our first section here with executing commands now this workshop has been designed to be a learn by do right we are going to learn by doing so at this point uh you get to choose i saw like i said about a 40 20 split with catacota in your laptop let me go ahead and drop these links for you guys and i all of a sudden forgot the command that i used for the links what did i use for the links here let me give me a second as i as you you're watching the fourth wall stuff right unless somebody beats me to it here we go okay i found it sorry about that took me a second to remember what i had created here it's exercise zero so yes thank you yeah there's one here we go this is what i'd like you to do uh i you should see some links i'm gonna give them to you here in we've already got the setup thank you eric i see eric's dropping them right so for those of you who are using catacotta um oh you couldn't hear it okay for those of you who are using the catacotta scenarios it looks like eric has dropped those and you already signed up there and here and then for those who are going to use docker then there you go so if you're going to do it online or i'm sorry if you're going to do it with catacota use the first link that i dropped here there we go the catacota one and then the second one is going to be the github repo now the difference with this is if you're using catacotta oh you can hear again renji okay cool if you're using catacotta you don't have to really do anything here so i'm just going to do it with you guys so i'm going to go to the repo here at no sql bench workshop online and you notice the way i set this up right you see this initial no sql bench setup if you're using cateco you don't need to do anything at all but if you are gonna go to the the repo and do it with docker then you need to go to this first zero setup readme which is right there really this is mostly set up to get you docker if you don't already have docker take a moment to do it this should support the various os's that are here there is a desktop installer for windows i'll give you guys just a moment for that because i did see a good amount of folks that are going to do it this way once you have that though and again for use for folks in catacota just bear with me for a moment because you don't need to do this this is going to be done for you once you have your docker set up what i want you to do is you're going to see in all of the sections i'm going to give you this command execute and then it'll have it right below it right so once docker is running you see my docker is running i'm going to go ahead and execute this command this is going to start up your cassandra your cassandra database if i pop over to my docker you'll see i've got my cassandra there and it takes just a moment for it to come up uh and after you've gotten to this point you just need to download musical bench right i'm on mac so what i would do is download the jar now obviously i've done that you can just click on the link here it's the same thing with windows by the way you just use the jar you will you will need java 14. i believe is that required yet chuki or is it just recommended at this point i think it would be best to say it's required because okay while while it may work with earlier versions i think we're setting our project up to use 14 because of language features and runtime got it okay so if you're not at java 14 this is the one thing you know about using the jars if you can use the binary and you're on linux wonderful you don't have to worry about it because the jvm is already embedded in the in the binary you don't have to worry about this but for those of us who are on mac and windows and can't use the binary mac especially can be kind of a pain to upgrade your java i included a link right here if you want to use open jdk 14 which is a really good one to use with brew this link will give you the instructions on how to do that hopefully we don't have too many folks who have to sit there and do that but once you've gotten to a point where you have the jar and hopefully you're at the right version of java for those folks then you're set for the moment for the linux folks if you just do a wget um i suggest by the way in both cases that create like a no sql bench directory right this is again for the folks doing it locally we are we're going to have some artifacts that are generated through this process there are going to be some logs they're going to be some other files so it's going to be good to just put that in a separate directory that will be self-contained make sure for those folks that are on linux that after you pull the full file down with wget that you are doing a change mod to make it executable otherwise it's not going to execute and then for that that's it for this particular section so i'm going to give you guys just a moment i'll just wait and if i can start getting some thumbs up again catacota folks you guys are good to go but for everybody else if you're going to do it locally if i can get some thumbs up when you're ready to go so i get a feel for when you are up or when you've at least got it downloaded is this the point where i need to turn on some of the music as people like install like they get java going okay i see some folks coming in you know i dropped you guys like a million links over there all right again i'm just giving folks a moment to get for those who are doing it locally to get their stuff downloaded it should by the way it's not a huge uh file it shouldn't take very long to pull it down okay cool i see a thumbs up there now i'm gonna probably butcher your name and i'm so sorry i think it's uh looks like a tea to voice but i'm not sure um did you shooky are you still with me oh i lost i lost our wizard i am with you now oh did the stream die okay let me take a look yes it did all right it looks like it's trying to load again on youtube but yeah okay checking it out all right looks like it looks like we lost the stream it's skipping but it does seem to be streaming maybe it will clean up okay let's see here looks like we're having some stream problems okay it's back on youtube it says okay that's good okay i do see the stream live again all right stream came back sorry about that yay all right i don't know what happened there okay let me alex just tell me to stop the stream start the stream up hopefully we see this back again for some reason the stream got a little funky there all right and shook you are still with me okay good all right it sounds like we're back okay great guys thank you i don't know what happened there yeah there we go thank you for the patience okay wonderful okay great all right so let's go ahead and go back so with that i'm gonna go ahead and move on um as far as the next part so essentially that was just getting you initially set up if you you had the local setup hopefully you guys were able the ones doing it locally uh to be able to get docker you know and get it downloaded and again catacota you didn't really have much to do so with that we're going to go ahead and drop into the first exercise and let me drop this in for you guys oh helps if i type the right characters here we go boom there's that so here's the first exercise let me drop these for you guys on youtube good all right you'll notice if you go to the catacotta um that you should be able to go right to it i'm going to do these with you by the way so this is this one here there's no sql bench try it out the link that i gave you the link that's actually here as well should this one here catacota will bring you exactly to this one and it should look something like this okay excellent thanks for the feedback guys with the stream i appreciate that now if you happen to start running into some issues doing this locally but you want to follow along i suggest then just pop in catacota and you can do it with us and then you can always you know do the do the local stuff is homework um so you should see something like this in catacoda i'm going to say start scenario [Laughter] oh i hope you guys aren't seeing that particular uh error that i just saw i'm going to have to hit up there we go yeah so you should see it starting to create some resources and it will take just a moment here and the first oh oh this is the unexpected thing i'm going to reach out to someone real quick is anyone else seeing this on catacota the content owner's account has reached capacity are you seeing that okay good okay good i'm glad that you're not seeing it that's what's important as long as you guys can get through it that's what matters okay okay thank you all right we have we have a call in the category to get this taken care of hopefully you guys are not experiencing this so this is what we're gonna do i was gonna walk through this with you but i'm just going to give you guys 15 minutes let's go ahead and walk yourself through this initial scenario again everything should be in there i'm going to give you a little music and such for those of you who are doing it here online if you go to the instructions you will see and i'll actually talk to this as well but let me go ahead and get you some music because i do like this music and i'm going to make sure not to blow your ears out so bear with me just for a moment and all right hopefully we have a little background music put it about there give you guys about 15 minutes okay good go ahead and set a timer okay so thandie i see it and for those of you who are going through it right now or if you're like i see um okay yeah vanity and the gender on that kind of deal for those who are running into that issue i will go through and we'll walk through this so don't fail we're just gonna leave you and the good thing about it i i wonder if what's happening there's enough of us on today that maybe it's over uh over inundating uh inundating catacota a little much we'll get that we're gonna try to get that taken care of we can always do these after so it's not like if you don't do it during the workshop you're never gonna have them but i will try to bring you through them uh once we're past that point okay family it looks like it worked on a second try great okay it looks like they just need to catch up or something okay yeah let's see if i have luck okay and for those by the way who are having a hard time with catacota now while we address this even if you're not intending to do it locally it might be a good idea to go ahead and just take a look at the repo go to the link read through the materials and kind of see what's going on here um especially too because i want to make it fair as possible for the quizzes when i give you guys quizzes so take a moment go through the materials i think you'll get a feel and then i'll walk you through when we're at time all right so capacity should be going up i'm going to try this again myself hey shashi let's see that's in catacota huh can you let us know exactly what um that is an unexpected thing there yeah i have an idea i know where you are in the category but can you show me what command you're running lily is that in catacota or is that locally yeah i'm wondering guys for those are for everyone for those of you who are running into some like if it seems like it's taking a moment um on the on the progress piece i think that that's probably due to them trying to spin up enough resources for us so we'll just give it another moment let me see where we are here okay no uh so keep no right it's not the expected behavior um up on on catecoder or anything the initial load is going when we do something like what we did with calling mb cqliot this is very high level but inside that we're going to break this down a little bit today inside that is a whole workload that's creating the schema it's ramping up data it's doing all sorts of things in the very first example you'll notice that after you execute mbcql iot we say just go ahead and control c we're just getting it up and showing you the most basic basic example we're not giving you any console output of what the progress is there's actually a whole scenario that's going to run like a million operations underneath the hood right so it might look like it's just sitting there however it might also be the fact that we're having some issue with the resources in catacota so i'm i'm waiting for mine to kick here um so i can actually go through this with you yeah niren that is a great question so the way we've done it in the beginning and i'm glad you asked that question so the question just for everybody else there is where exactly are the workload equals cql key valve key value files so what's happening is and we're going to break all this down i'm going to show you what the contents of all the files look like and i think it's going to come together for you but you can operate in a sql bench in a couple different ways you can operate it where we have um something where we just call the workload like we do in the beginning with cql iot or cql key value and just leave it at that but underneath the hood is actually a yaml file and in that yaml file is where all of the various phases of the workload are right so we're glossing over a lot just to get going and as we go we're going to break it down so we will show you that oh the files yes the files they're all in the binary of the jar you can actually pull those out we're going to do that today okay then id so it seems like they're it seems like it's having a it seems like catechol is having an issue there so what i'm going to do is we'll give folks the rest of the five minutes to finish up for those who are working and then i'm going to go through the scenario locally so you can get a feel of what we're going to see yes akiv that's right you're going to see a schema a baseline schema that was created exactly oh okay it looks like it looks like steve has dropped a link here you go guys let's try this i drop you a new link i'm going to try this myself all right we're going to try this this should hopefully have some new resources ah this is what this should look like wonderful all right everybody i dropped some links again i appreciate your patience there i dropped some links both in discord and youtube those new links should bring you to um a new catacotta scenario that actually has more resources for us to use that's okay niren if that happens just refresh yeah catacota will timeout after some time yes yes let's see yay okay good it looks like people are getting in that's wonderful i'm again i appreciate your patience there as we get through this all right let me okay good the new link is working that's wonderful okay good all right yay you know since people had issues what i'm going to do is i'm going to stop the timer and i'm going to go ahead and just walk through this with you folks and hopefully the idea here is why i want to do it this way uh is to to help explain some of the things again i'm seeing some really good questions coming in we'll get there all right so first thing you'll notice that we do a node tool status um i mentioned before that when you use the catacotta scenarios the cassandra part is handled for you you may have noticed when you first launched a scenario let's say something like loading resources and you might have seen like a little ticker there as it loaded cassandra the scenario is built so you don't need to worry about the database the focus is on nosql bench so we just loaded cassandra for you that's what the no tools status is showing us that i do have a node here that is up then we're going to go ahead and download it and for those doing it locally in docker that's what that first command does as well it'll load cassandra up for you as i mentioned if we're using a linux file system we need to make sure it's executable so i'm going to change mod plus x to nb and then i'm going to run a test now i saw some questions coming out for this right at this point when you do this you're not going to see too much and it's just because of the way that we have parameterized this command we're just saying nb cql iot i'm saying nosql bench run the cql iot workload and a question i saw that came in earlier is where is that right so it's located in the binary or in the jar there actually there are some base workloads that have already been baked in this is one of those and we're calling that now you might be curious well how do i get access to that can i do something with it yes you can and i'm going to show you that later but at this point we're just doing the most simple thing at the very basic the most basic simple way you could actually just call a workload like this and that's it it's actually running the workload in the background and you see that information is being logged out to a particular log but other than that in this case it's not going to show much more so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and do our control c that's just going to kill that and then we'll clean up so somebody did mention that they they saw that they had a baseline's key space so just to give you a little bit behind the scenes we're going to dig into the next part but within that cql iot workload is the schema creation is the initial data seed and all of that it's all baked in there and we're gonna we're gonna see that okay so let me go ahead and move on so now this is where we're starting to break it down a little bit so notice in this next one what we're gonna do is we're gonna say no sql bench run now i'm specifying some of the command line parameters that we left out of the first one right so in particular i'm going to set my driver to cql now this stuff is kind of you know spelled out down here but what i'm saying is there are multiple drivers in no sql bench there's a standard out driver that will actually just spit stuff out to the screen if you want to do a test load there's a sql a cql driver that's going to say i'm running a cassandra workload using cql right there's all sorts of other drivers so we're specifying we're going to talk to cassandra we're going to call out a specific workload say okay this one i want to do cql key value and then this tags phase schema once we start to look in the files in a later part of the scenarios you're going to see where this comes into play but what we're saying is i want to call the schema phase of the cql key value workload i'm going to click on that and now that's just going to run that that schema phase right so once this finishes if i then do a describe key space and the the key space in this time is called baselines you should see that we have right here here's my baseline's key space and here's my key value table so when i call the schema phase of the cql key value workload it created the schema that's pretty much what i show you there let's see do i have questions or anything yeah now ryan use the new link it looks like that one's working a lot better a wonderful way thank you for posting the uh the yaml as well and we will in the third scenario we're actually going to go through this as well we're actually going to look at the ammo all right so let me move on so now in this next one we've created our we've created our schema right but now you need some initial c data in the system because if you think about it when you do your performance benchmarks if you if you start benchmarking at a complete cold and shooky i'll i'm going to ask you to add in some commentary here in a moment if you do it from a complete cold run you're not really getting the performance benchmarks that would come from what your nominal system looks like what's your data when it has some some data in the system what that looks like when it's actually running right so the next thing we want to do is ramp up this rampa phase is going to say let's see the data with some initial data do you have anything you want to add to that you need to make sure laying in data until you achieve that desired density because all of your results your your throughput your latency or density they're all tied together and so you need to make that a realistic scenario before you run your main face of your test now for some reason we're not hearing do we hear shooky at all i think after the reset you lost me all right give me just a second okay give me a second guys sorry about that i'm gonna fix the shooky part all the little buttons and everything that you have to worry about when we're doing this uh i think i think i know exactly what happened yep no you're on multi-output i have no idea how about now shooky can you talk for me um i'm here can you hear me okay what's my level okay you do hear him now all right go for it if i okay can somebody uh okay good uh yes so going back to the topic of uh the ramp up phase so any any time you test your system and and by the way please give us another confirmation if you can hear me okay because i'm not absolutely clear if i'm coming through you should be clear now okay good okay yeah if you could just i'm gonna have shuki repeat that sorry about that guys that was my fault yeah go for it oh but the first explanation was so much but now sorry yeah right all right so uh when you're uh setting up to do a test uh you want your testimony to be as realistic as possible because all your performance always depends on your density your operating you know the achieve throughput and the latency the latency density and throughput are all tied together right so a realistic scenario uh has a density per node that is what you would be targeting in production and if you don't set that up in your test the numbers you get are not going to be reliable for production planning so you always want to make sure that you run your test at a a realistic density so you get a realistic reference point and that's what the ramp up phase is all about it's meant to allow you to lay data in as if you're setting a stage for the main phase of the test in an incremental fashion until you reach that target density so that your main test is uh is going to give you accurate numbers for production planning okay cool so hopefully you guys heard that this time um it gives you an idea where the ramp up phase comes into play and why that's important right so something someone pointed out over here um let's see is cannot see the data after insertion so another thing i want to point out about the command that we're at right here is notice what the driver is notice here in the rambo command for this run the driver is standard out so when we are saying driver standard out what we're doing this is actually a way you can test your activities before you go ahead and just put a bunch of data in your system right so notice when i did this it actually spit the values out here to standard out so i can see what is this going to look like then when i am ready to insert the data into my system i would change my driver to cql saying i'm now going to use the cql driver and talk to cassandra so standard out is a nice way you can do an initial test to kind of validate what you're seeing is it what you expect then you can do your data ramp up i mean that's up to you but it's an option so we just put that in here so you can kind of see that illustrated okay so i've run my um okay good okay cool so i've run the the first initial test with standard out so i can see what the values look like right now if you notice under here in catacoda we kind of ask you to hey try to do it and insert the data this time notice the driver sql i'm going to do that so now if we take a look and we do our cqlsh-e here notice that i have data by the way for those of you who are doing this on your local machines something really cool that you can do with docker um let's see if we come over here yeah yeah this one okay notice this right here i want you to notice this command for those guys doing it locally once you have cassandra i named in the instructions right i had you spin up a cassandra instance named my cassandra and docker right so if you take a look if you go to the docker desktop or the dashboard and you'll see that it's called my cassandra well you can use that name what's really neat is you can actually execute commands against your containers so what i'm doing here is i'm saying hey docker execute a command cqlsh i want to execute cqlsh with the same exact thing that you'll notice that is here in cqlshow so you can do the same thing right that's why i have that there that's kind of a nice little feature of docker okay all right so notice here i've got the data i see here was my first test run now if i take a look at some of these look at values you know uh key zero at this value three two whatever you know obviously those should match right and something else to note that is really cool about no sql bench is the data runs when you when you generate the data the data is actually generated deterministically so in later runs i will actually have for the same data set everything i will have the same data so that actually kind of makes that nice especially when you're rinsing and repeating and running these you know that you're going to be running against the same data all right so let me go ahead and continue on so now this next one i'm going to go ahead and just run it a couple things let's break down what's going on here uh in the command line notice we're back to our driver cql so we are going to be working directly with the database not just putting the output out we're using that same workload as before but now i notice my my phase is main right now i've created my schema i've ramped up the data like what shooku is talking about right now we've got that initial seat of data in place now i'm going to go through and i'm actually going to run the main phase in this particular case and again we're going to dig into this a little bit later inside the cql value the cql key value workload are going to be some queries these queries are going to be the very read write statements the same exact thing that you have in your application same thing with schema and everything they're the same exact thing that you will have in your application so what we're doing now is we're running whatever those read and write workloads are in in the main phase another thing here is notice cycles equals 100 000. we just ran 100 000 operations with no sql bench against our cassandra database in this particular case that means that in your main phase if you had a set of queries in there that you're gonna you'll split between them you're gonna have a hundred thousand iterations they're gonna each execute that many times um the cycle rate is saying it's going to limit if you want it to by the way these options are all optional right hence their options we just put them in here as examples you can kind of get a feel the cycle rate though is saying that i want to limit the amount of operations that i'm going to run as 5 000 per second right i'm going to limit that for 5 000 per second i could take that off and let it do it as fast as it wants um i'm actually uh quite surprised sometimes i've done these runs at a lot of cycles and depending on the queries in the system i'm amazed sometimes how quickly it'll do them so sometimes one thing you might want to take into consideration is you know in your own systems if you have any throttling or if you want to kind of you know control the rate at which your operations are executing then that's where that cycle rate comes into play um one last thing i want to mention here is this progress console is notice it was two seconds so now we're getting a little bit more output so not only is it working with the database in the back end but you see the progress console every two seconds it was giving me some information of the status of things right so that's actually kind of nice to use okay um and then looking at results so by the way i want to be clear about something notice in the scenario here we're actually removing the previous logs we just do that to make the next command um easier right that way we only have one log file to work with do you need to do that in your own that that's totally up to you right again we just did to clean things out there's no requirement that you remove the logs before you run again or something um the only real difference here the same command before we're just going to go ahead and let it run spit out the log and it's almost done let's see cool and i see shooky has a night response there wonderful okay [Music] cool all right and just okay i'm just checking all right so we finished our run and we spit that out so what i'm going to do now is notice here now this is if you're on linux right obviously if you're on a mac you probably have something very similar to this and this isn't the most basic way of looking at your logs right but we are essentially filtering on this type equals timer right so if we're looking specifically for the performance metrics then we can look at that type equals timer and nobody expects you by the way to memorize all this stuff it is in the nosql bench docs um so we have just called out certain pieces here for you so to kind of focus in on them uh you could use your favorite favorite editor or whatever but you'll notice here we get all sorts of performance data that comes out of here now this is probably the most um like the basic way to do it right look at the log files see the output and do it when it really comes to doing this for real there's probably better ways to do it we're going to do that in the next scenario but we just want you to know at the very basic level that all your performance data for run will go out into your log files and i'm not going to read through all these right now if you take a look at this uh later you'll get an idea of what each of these counters mean but there's a lot of data that's being that's being stored off for each of the metrics wonderful okay so hopefully though i you know again i i really appreciate you guys being patient as we kind of work through some of the catacotas stuff there in the beginning um and hopefully now it will be smoother moving on we've already done that part so like i said we're gonna learn by doing uh so next in the dashboarding with grafana and prometheus section we're gonna go to yet another uh catacotta scenario let me drop this down hopefully our catacottas work a lot but oh we probably need the new link right so that's right we need a new link let me go ahead and so that link that we got before yes so i'll grab this one and i will drop this down for you guys let's hope this works better let me drop it here there you go and that's for catacota oh steve already beat me to it thank you steve yeah looks like it looks like everything is up and running okay so for this one i will go ahead and give you guys 10 minutes and i'll make sure to turn down this over here so it doesn't get too loud and i'll give you guys some music so okay good i'm not seeing folks um let me know that catacota's not working for them so hopefully that means that they're good hmm you all right let me i'm seeing a couple things come up let me uh try something here real quick with the one that you guys are working okay so mikhail you just had to refresh is that what you did did you refresh the catacotta scenario or did you just retry the command over mikhail just to retry the command interesting do you see uh duncan do you see grafana 701 separate from graphite exposure exporter do you see uh grafana 701 in your images list in docker so for dongfeng while we're um over here so what i'm going to do let me uh pull this up in my end here so let's see how much time okay yeah fine dude let's see so when you oh yeah that's right sorry i have to do a dot slash until where the file is my bad there we go okay so when you load this dong thing um when you use the docker metrics if you take a look here you should see three but in particular do you have grafana 701 is that loading properly i am noticing by the way that in catacota um that this is taking longer than i would expect to run let's see i haven't yeah i haven't actually seen this so i wonder if we're seeing some slowdowns in the catacota piece again okay yeah i see i see some folks saying that okay so dongfang if you don't okay so it looks like we're having some katakota slowdowns again all right we'll go ahead and walk through it um so you should see dongfeng you should see uh grafana 701 that should have been automatically provisioned for you um what let's see okay all right um it's interesting that you're not seeing that it should have been auto provisioned along with the graphite explorator which it sounds like you have and prom what happens wrong thing if you just okay if you just run the command again do you see anything different and that's for dongfeng by the way yeah nirian so the way that that ramp is set notice that it's 0.12 right so you can actually have a case where you use you throttle an nosql bench run where a lot of these are set up to have a million cycles a million operations that's a million queries so if i set my cycle rate down to like 100 or a thousand or something like that it's just going to step through them very slowly so that's what you're seeing there right you're seeing the fact that it it is meant because it's been throttled it's going to take it a minute to to get through all that data so i'm not surprised oh it's not progressing and always are you just saying it's just staying there it just stuck all right so what i'm gonna do guys um it looks like katakota is giving us an issue again let me see if i can't refresh the link okay i'm just gonna do it locally so you guys can see okay it looks like word oh that's unfortunate about catacota oh oh yeah that's definitely an issue steve i'm gonna post this the there we go all right so i'm going to go ahead and just do this locally so you guys can see pull this over okay so this is the same exact scenario by the way that would have run in catacona there's no difference other than the fact that i'm using the jar and i'm doing it with docker and hopefully dongfing maybe this will give you something that you're looking for so notice here that i have run the same uh the same command that we're doing in catacota right and now iran i know you're saying it wasn't progressing at all i just want to point out notice our cycle rate is 100. if you take a look underneath in the data um then it's there's like a this is trying to go for like a million operations right so that's going to really slow it down we did that on purpose because we wanted this to run for a moment you'll see that it's running here though so what i should be able to do you see this message right here right it's letting me know that i've got these docker containers so i should then just be able to go to localhost 3000 and you're going to see now i've already logged in otherwise you would see like a login where you put in admin admin go to home and to the to the dashboard and then you'll see something like this right uh and again this is being powered by uh the docker containers let's see yeah that's right it looks like it does look like we're we're running into catacota um limitations here it looks like they're kind of not able to keep up now i think a lot of this is because there's so many of us on doing it at the same time if you guys do this stuff later in catacota it should be fine i've been doing this for for weeks and it hasn't been an issue so i do i do think part of what's going on just too many people on at once um so yeah so i'm just going to run through it let me go here let me actually pretend like i was going through it it should let me through so here's the initial one where we ran the cycle rate 100 progress console 15 second to docker metrics that's exactly what i did up here you'll see the stacker metrics and it started not only running in the benchmark but when i go to localhost 3000 you see i've got grafana now something i want to point out about this this is really glossing over a lot um the fact that you can just call the command and tag on docker metrics in this fashion right and that's it that actually hooks up all of the graphite exporter which is exporting the data out of nosql bench prometheus which is the thing that's actually getting all the metrics and that's what's hooking up to kerfana and then launching your final all of this has been completely pre-configured for you so you don't have to mess with it if you did not have this you'd have to go get all those things figure out how to hook them up and do all that right so i really want to point out that this one command is built to make it as absolutely simple as possible to be able to just launch and go i didn't have to do anything but go to localhost 3000 and go to you know and log in go to the dashboard but now you can see it's starting to pull the data from that particular run hey buddy sorry um so you can see that it is starting to pull uh the data from that particular run that's it right it makes it really simple to do okay so this part of it is actually just kind of going through um what that would have looked like here where you log in with admin admin you pick the dashboard and go on and then this is where we start to explain things so what's really cool in this part though is notice in the dashboard up here shooky has been nice enough and let me make sure if shooky's going to talk here real quick that i've got his volume so you can hear him hey shooky still with me i'm with you wonderful all right i jacked his volume up hopefully you guys can hear him just fine um so what's really nice is that the dashboard now this is collapsible this part is collapsible if you didn't want to see this once you kind of understand but in each one of these there's a really nice sort of explanation it kind of breaks it down to what each one of these these particular metrics is looking at but these were picked on purpose right these were picked on purpose because they have um definite relevance to what you're doing in your benchmarking now they're not the only benchmarks but this is a really good starting place right so if you take a look at ops and shooky at any point feel free to jump in if you want to add some nuance or anything and b be my nosql bench wizard um i'm just going to step through these real quick but if you have things you want to add please do um so for the ops and successful ops we're looking at the number of operations right and but we're comparing the number of operations compared to the number that were successful these should be the same you should have the same number of successful ops that you do operations but the point of doing this is if you see a discrepancy here if you start to see that i have a lot more ops than i do successful ops it tells me you're getting errors somewhere and it's probably something you want to investigate um that is then linked that is there's a correlation between that and the error counts right now and a normal run how many air accounts should you see zero right you shouldn't be seeing errors if you're seeing errors it's time to go ahead and investigate uhuki is there anything you want to add to those either one of those yeah so um having an error occasionally in a production system is something that happens at scale and at speed and you have spikey loads and things like that so in a realistic scenario your applications do need to be able to handle those and so you need to make sure that they're set up for that there are some additional settings inside nosql bench and the cql driver type to let you customize how those errors are handled so if you're doing a very large load and you want to be able to go back and resume and you know make sure that you know about errors but don't actually stop a 10 hour run like you're trying to lower terabyte data or node uh then you can set a flag something like errors equals count and so it won't stop the scenario if you see an error that's really important for doing large tests but you absolutely should pay attention to what kinds of areas you have and if you see a discrepancy in the ops and successful ops you should absolutely see it in their accounts graph and they're broken out by error type as well okay cool thank you thank you um by the way niren i'm seeing that you have grafina tab but no dashboard um were you getting to the point where you you saw grafana in catacota but then when you tried to go the dashboard it just didn't exist or yeah i'm actually curious what you found there so if you would let me know um no it's your first time okay don't fang yeah that's interesting we'll have to take a look at that because it should have downloaded all of the resources for docker for you um so we'll take definitely take a look at that all right so moving on to the second set here we have our service time distribution now service time is actually kind of interesting um and shooky is definitely gonna have something to say about this right service time is measuring the response time end to end from your client to the database back to the client and that's important and this is actually a really important metric because if you think about it when you're doing your performance benchmarking it's really pretty it's pretty key that you are benchmarking in a way that's going to look just like your real system right so if if you have a setup where let's pretend i'm just going to you know pretend like we're talking about cloud instances or whatever like if you have a bunch of application instances you're going to want to you know whatever however those are size whatever that network pathing is over to where your database is you're going to want to run no sql bench there with your performance benchmark the reason why is because you want a more realistic kind of scenario of what does it look like when the request comes from my application server goes to my database and comes back so it's important that you're going to run your sql bench from where your client is and that is part of what service time distribution is going to measure right it's going to measure that response time again end to end not just from like um you know the client to the server in that initial response point it's going to go from client to server all the way back right so that one's kind of key shook you got anything you want to add on that one i'll be quick uh this is uh a client vantage point so this is from within the sql bench runtime and it is an emulation in terms of what the metric means of an application so you should think about the sql bench as a proxy for an application that speaks only operation statements and data sets so that every other concern about your application is separate but you're testing that link from the client system through the database and back it's very important to be aware that the client vantage point is different from the server vantage point and to know how to look at them and contrast them but we're doing a client based test here which is the most uh conservative way to measure what your application would see and and that's why we want to start there okay awesome thank you wonderful i'm just responding to a couple things yeah it looks like i i feel like some of the messages i'm seeing with folks in catacota with some of the weird errors i feel like they're related to some of the performance issues we're having with catacota right now um and maybe some resources aren't getting allocated or something um all right all right so then um and then as far as opt tries so this next one here optimized by the way all of these i'm giving you kind of a quick summary so you kind of have an idea of the context here right but all of these are explained not only here uh but in the catacota scenarios you notice in the workshop as well you scroll down we kind of we kind of break it down it's also in the docs we're just trying to make it really easy right in the dashboard for you to have a quick reference that you can look at so optrize is another one of those cases where generally you should see a value of one right what this means is this is how many tries how many retries or tries did it take to execute my operation right so i should only see one here now if i start to see a value go past one right maybe maybe at a two or three or something like that it's definitely something to take a look at however if i have a case of like i have 10 retries for all of my operations that tells me i'm probably overloaded right there's definitely something you need at that point if if you're ever seeing that things might be on fire remember the truck from earlier so you might want to really take a look at what's going on here again these are all indicators to help kind of tease things out like what would the nominal load look like and if i see outliers of the things to take a look at again shooky anything you want to add to the op tries quickly yes uh i have something to say for every one of these problems yeah right i'm not surprised maybe i should stop asking you just go ahead and say it no i i i like this i like this back and forth it works so uh options can be a really insightful signal in that as you start to saturate a system you might see some tries go up to two at the high percentiles and as you overload a system more incrementally that number bleeds down into the lower percentiles and the value of it goes up so it's good to experiment with that if you're trying to learn about system saturation and system loading behavior because it it it gives a lot of information in one metric so that's that's really all i have to say about that one but just pay attention to it learn about how it works it can be really valuable cool awesome all righty all right and then you know just kind of glossing over the last four here so the the p75 and p99 client overhead these are specifically the overhead of nosql bench right so it's good to be able to have an idea of what kind of overhead you should not be seeing very large numbers here uh notice as a matter of fact in both these cases even with our p99 so 99 of all of the no sql bench operations are within 100 microseconds right that's that's really fast so that's a good indicator to let me know that nosql bench itself is not putting undue load or undue strain on my system um so that's that's why those are there that's really kind of more of um just a check like an indicator it's not something that's directly talking about your application and shooky what do you want to add i know you want to add some uh yeah so uh we should rename this uh i want to name this in those sql bench internals and we'll probably reduce it down to one panel the next version of the dashboard but it's just a if you see it mostly flat here don't worry about it if you see it go over a second do worry about it if it's if you see it spiky worry about it it's just to give you a sanity check to know that your composed system together is going to give you good metrics because the part that's doing the measurement itself is not overloaded any spikiness you see here will manifest is lower fidelity in your other metrics and that's why it's here i see i see now somebody i'm curious if somebody did see like a one second spike in the p99 client overhead or the sql bench overhead what could they do about it what do they need to check into well i i don't think we've ever really seen that before so no sql bench the the control loop in inside no sql bench is really optimized for efficiency so if you saw spikiness here something would be really wrong okay like maybe something else is using the local system it's it's swapping or there's some gc storms happening because of some strange contention of resources so you just want to make sure you're not having that so that you can trust your other metrics okay excellent thank you and then the last two here so the service time range is essentially just the max of the service time distribution um you do you do see the max here as well if you actually look at the underlying labels that are in the chart the max is included the reason why it is is here is it's again it's another one of those things you want to keep an eye on if you are seeing especially a lot of spikes here or something like that and you're seeing a lot of um of hits in the higher ranges for your max definitely something to take a look at and then finally your cycle count so notice if you're remembering our commands you can define the cycles the how many cycles that you want right and some of the ones we've been using today use a hundred thousand cycles or once we work in we're going to look at the workloads here in a moment you're going to see with a million or 10 million cycles cycles equal my my statements right that's the amount of queries that i'm actually processing so this is just a way as you're going through the benchmark you can see okay i've set my uh my cycles to a certain number and it'll give you an idea as a matter of fact if we look up here what do we set this one to oh okay this one's the default that might actually be going to a million i think that one's set to a million so anyway it is just the number of cycles the number of operations that i have stepped through okay last part here and this is also in the uh in both the scenarios and such is the prometheus part so i'm just going to go ahead and do it for you guys notice that it's not just grafana when you see the output where my here it goes when you see the output you get both grafana and prometheus right so if i were to go over i don't know how many of you guys are familiar with prometheus um but this is definitely an understand industry standard tool um that is it is already again included in the system so prometheus is going to be the part this is what grafana is talking to grafana's talking to prometheus as its endpoint to get the data so if i were to go to prometheus you can actually see like in this case it's a really simplistic example because i only have a single node in my cluster but if i had 100 nodes in my cluster right i'd see them up here because prometheus is going to be talking to them i'm sorry this is for nosql bench if i was looking at a cluster you can you can hook up for me things in grafana to your cassandra clusters as well i just misstated that so in this case i should i should just have as many of these as i i would my nosql bench um instances um but this will just let you know like who's it who is it connected to that it's in a good state but the real part i want to go to is graph so you'll notice that like i said there's just a subset we're looking at a subset of the metrics that are available here if you go if you want to kind of dive deeper into the metrics that you have you can do that here in prometheus now a little kind of pro tip in grafana if you see this little drop down next to any one of these if you go to edit this is cool this gets all fun like if you like little knobs and things then grafana's review but you'll see that here is the metric i'm looking at right i could literally pull this out and put it right into prometheus so if i go result success and if i look at the metric here i can look for result success i use a different one in the examples online oh i got named back let me scroll forever see did i mention there's a lot of metrics that gives you a good idea there's a lot of metrics in here here we go results success that's what i was looking for right and then if i execute this you see the data i can say graph now i am just barely scratching the surface of the prometheus part the goal here isn't go into prometheus the point is if you really want to start to explore some of the underlying metrics and get kind of geeky you can do it it's here but this is just one of the tools that is provided for you when you use that dash dash docker metrics that's you know automatically loaded for you here i'm going to try it with the uh the original one let's see if this works or not if not i'll walk you guys through the repo it's got the same information however the way this has been built in here it actually does a really nice job of helping you understand how the files are coming together so all right here we go and again i'm just going to walk through this one just to see if we can't get past that the issues of catacota so i don't know if catacota is going to take a moment for the starting cassandra but i can still go through it it should allow me to do these commands here i'm just going to do some of these locally make that easier so the first thing i want to point out here is you know so far we've been working with all of these various workloads right and some of you asked some questions like where are those coming from how do i know what they are so on and so forth and that's what the dash list workloads does for you right so i can pass dash list workloads and it will give me a list of all the various workloads that are baked in to the jar of the binary right now you notice that we've been using cql key value today in cql iot there are others in there you can also make your own you're not limited to just these um so but if you do want to see those workloads that's one way to do it within workloads are scenarios we're going to talk about those in just a moment oh good now it started up i can do this um if you want to list the scenarios you might guess it's just the scenarios and this will then list the scenarios and their parameters that are within those workloads right let's so let's break this down i want to show you guys this part with the file so you can kind of see what this looks like now we mentioned that it's a good idea to start with the base workloads that are already there and work from there for your own data models that's where the copy command comes in so if you want to copy any of the internal workloads all you have to do is say copy iot right this is going to pull the i o the cql cqliot workload from the one you know inside of uh nosql bench and it has now made a copy of it uh so if i were to go ahead and then you know take a look here you'll see i have a secular iot yaml sitting there it's that easy right it just makes it you can copy anything lightweight like that way it's really flexible that way so again i i recommend that you start with one of the base workloads and work from there so i'm going to go ahead and load this all right now here's the thing if you take a look at if you take a look at this file at first it might be a lot a little daunting right there's all this stuff going on these different scenarios there's you know interesting characters like what's going on with this what does template mean right it could be a lot to process at first but what we're going to do is we're going to break this down and we're going to make it so you kind of understand that the underlying parts this is something this is a more advanced workload this hasn't been built up right you don't need to start here just be clear um by the way um yeah vanity i do i saw the same thing um so that's why i'm walking you guys through it because it seems like we're having some issue with the kanekoda thing um and same thing with uh lily yeah it's the same deal so i'm just gonna walk you guys through it you can always do these after the fact i feel like when not all of us are on here it'll work better or you can do the the online uh ones on the github repo with docker um i also saw a question can you run nosql bench against a cluster and test multiple cl totally absolutely if we're just using single nodes in this case to make it quick and easy to spin one up and get going you can absolutely hook this up to your your cluster as a matter of fact if you think about it your driver when you hook up to a cassandra cluster right the driver itself is also aware it gossips and everything so even if you have a thousand nodes i only need to hook up to one of those things and it's going to be able to see all of them can i test multiple consistency levels absolutely right as i break this down for you i'm going to show you a case where you can actually have multiple queries and that's the point right if you want to be able to test multiple consistency levels maybe and don't overuse a lot of filtering don't do it but let's say you had a case where you were using all filtering and you want to test what does that look like compared to a not allow filtering scenario you can build that all into a single workload and then you can you can run those iteratively right and you can it's really flexible with what you can do so the answer is yes and that was for nicholas all right so here's the file we're going to go ahead and move on and you know if i wanted to i could run this right you could see i've copied this out now i'm saying dot slash i'm getting that relative path and now it is going to run this scenario i'm going to go ahead and stop that let's go ahead and continue okay so let me load up a basic basic schema for you so the file is empty at this point let's build this up and see how to do it so i'm going to go ahead and copy this now the very first thing here um you'll notice at the top of these you'll have like the command right this is telling you here's the command you can use to make this run and then a description what is this thing doing what is this workload doing and if we break it down a little bit more now remember before in our command lines i said we're going to talk about this right and how when you want to call one of the particular phases main ramp up schema or whatever you have this in the command line it's like tags equals phase schema why why that kind of nomenclature because what we're actually doing is we're still we're telling it in the yaml what i'm what i'm calling so here we're going to set up a block with a schema phase right this is just the very beginning piece of it then as i start to create my query and everything in this case since my schema phase i'm just telling it prepared false i'm saying do not prepare these statements i'm only running them once now in cassandra generally speaking when you're when you're running your your main phase stuff when you're running your application queries you want those to be prepared but in schema creation you're just running them once right so in that case you can actually say false but you have full control all over over all the cql parameters and everything that you want and this is just showing you an example of one of those now i'm going to bring the statement in this is a very base i just want to point this out at a basic level this is it right you have a workload here this one called this cql iot basic schema where i'm just loading a schema phase and notice my statements this is the cql that you would be running in your app this is exactly what it is now in a case in this case because they use the iot workloads the defaults you're going to know some things about using like time window compaction strategy and stuff you could all of these are optional right and honestly all the stuff in here is optional but the very base based level i now have a workload that has a schema phase that in this phase is not going to prepare the statements is going to run three queries my create key space my create table or tables and then truncate because if notice these are if not exist so if i had a previous run the truncate will zero it out right so these are just the same kind of queries that you would be running within your applications it's the same thing all right let me go ahead and now here if i ran this you'll see that this runs and it's going to go ahead and create this particular schema table and do the truncate after oh yeah for those who if you do have to drop because we are running a little bit over let me go ahead and put the voucher in um we do have free cassandra certification vouchers for you um so if you go to the document that is here i'll put it in youtube as well then you can use that to go take a cassandra certification exam there you go thanks aaron for pointing that out for those have to leave okay so i'm just going to go ahead and move on to the next one so now we're going to do ramp up so we did the schema right now let's try that again here we go now again same deal i'm going to tell you how to run it right i have some description in there notice now my phases ramp up right instead of schema and now this is where i'm ramping up now i'm going to ignore the bindings for a moment i'll get there in a second but notice my statement so again this is where we're seeding our data we're doing that initial data load into the system so i just have an instant statement again this insert statement would be the same exact kind of statement you'd use in your application what i do want to point out are these look at the curly braces notice machine id sensor name time so on and so forth these are matched to my bindings so the bindings are the way this is where i'm getting the data that i'm generating for my seed data or for any of the data right so i just now we're not going to get into the bindings today there's all sorts of information i've actually included that in the github repo but but this is where you're going to drink you'll notice like something like variable words right this is actually a file that exists that has a set of words that are being used for the sensor name and then they're being hashed together you know to to give you very variations on that data for each of your iterations and such and you're going to see that through that like throughout your bindings like i said we're not going to get into detail but this is where you get your data from and then you use the curly braces to then map each of these bindings here to your bindings and somebody was asking about consistency level uh in my in my statement config could i i could have local one could i have one could have quorum i could put whatever i want could i have multiple iterations of this totally yeah you can do that okay and if i ran this then you'll see that it will run through that one as well yeah thanks marian yeah see ya all right all right for the rest of you guys who are able to stick around i am going to try to go through this as fast as i can all right so for the last one here for the main this should look like a familiar pattern now right so here we've built this up i've got well how do i run this thing notice my phase is main and again these are the same exact statements that i might run within my application now in the main this is now past the data uh the the initial c data right this is where i'm actually doing the main performance benchmark these are most likely going to be the ones that look pretty much what comes right out of your application you can just drop the cql right in here again notice my bindings right i've got my bindings on my curly braces and you see the mapping there okay i'm going to stop this one now this next part this is where it starts to get a little fun i've just created three files right i created one they're all the you know the various workloads but i created one for schema one for ramp up and one for main could i leave them like this i could right i could and i could actually you know i could just run these just like what you see here i could actually run every one in succession and run my um uh my my schema ramp up and and main cycles and i could run them in single files however i could combine them into a single file so all we have done now in one workload is simply added the schema phase the ramp up phase and the main phase it's all the same exact stuff we had before right so now you can start to see where you can start to build a more complex workload that actually represents your full life cycle from the time that you're creating your schema all the way through the seed data and into your main queries and this this is literally just appended this is each one of those three previous files it's just put together concatenated into a single file and then here's the fun this is the fun part this is really what i want to hit on here check this out so in this last one what we did is we add what are called name scenarios um so this is actually this whole time that we've been running and you've seen us doing something like you know dot slash nb cql iot and like nothing else like where are the parameters where what's going on this is what's going on here right so notice in this name name scenario this is called default right so you can have multiple by the way and i'll show you an example we had one in the beginning you could have as many name scenarios in here as you want and you can have variations on what you're doing in those particular scenarios this goes to something somebody was asking if i had different consistency levels or if i had different query access patterns i could create multiple name scenarios that all spelled each of those out and then when i do my runs i can easily call them from one file and something else you can do with the name scenario here so in default it's saying i want to run schema ramp up and main phases right but not only that it's saying use driver cql here's what tag i need how many threads how many cycles all sorts of things and this is just scratching the surface there is a ton of flexibility in here one thing i'm not showing you which was actually in the original file with this little little template a little less than less than greater than greater than notations you may have seen or template right you can make this all 100 configurable from the command line you can lock values if you want to if you want to set it you know absolute defaults or something and you don't want to have them configurable um you know from the outside uh that might be good for a ci cd pipeline where you know exactly what you want that workload to do and you don't want anyone to by accident change those defaults right you can do all of that here right so the idea is again starting with these basic files and building it up you can really build yourself the full end-to-end scenario pretty easily okay so with that that is that particular one again you know i i appreciate you guys being patient with us running into some issues with catacota and everything all of this is also in the github repository as well so you can do it on your own just a couple more things so we're gonna just punch through it and i really appreciate you guys hanging on i know we went a little bit over time all right so just a couple things to wrap up and then i do have some questions for you some survey questions at the end in mentee so please please stick with me it'll just take a couple minutes um so if you're not already familiar with academy.datasex.com totally free resource especially if you're interested in cassandra and like things in the nosql world there are tons of videos there all sorts of like exercises and stuff it's a really nice resource if you have questions though if you really you know if you've got questions about how do you operate cassandra um and and you know community.datasex.com is a place to go it's like stack overflow for cassandra right um so we have a whole set of experts who know this stuff in and out that are there it's a great place to go to not only ask some longer form questions but then you're adding that back to the community so other people can get those answers um we are all over social media and things like twitter youtube and twitch at deus ex devs um and uh the accelerate stuff um you'll notice that we we don't have an accelerate conference this year uh for for obvious reasons but we are doing accelerate online so you're gonna find keep an eye out on our channels you see that there's all sorts of videos and things that are coming out as far as that as well as i mentioned academy there are a whole set of courses all free like the whole all the stuff is free um recently released is the new cassandra definitive guide this is actually one of the co-authors on this is one of our team jeff carpenter a new o'reilly book so that is something to take a look and by the way these slides they're all in the github repo as well so all these links will be available there um we do have an upcoming event we have one of our kubernetes workshops uh there's i believe that's next week and that's in the apac time region so for those of you who are over there and you're here like two in the morning that's wonderful thank you but we do have workshops we're trying to get more and more out in other parts of the world uh and this is one of those so with that last thing for mentee to just finish up here as the last set of questions yeah deviance yeah i mean it was right there it was right there for the top four that's funny all right so yes thank you for giving me a thumbs up so we can get this last piece of questions by the way we every one of these workshops we do we take this stuff very seriously we take your feedback to evolve this stuff so i do appreciate you getting in here all right how likely is it that you would recommend this event to a friend or colleague wow that one person put in a 10. that's that's awesome i'm waiting to see where the average goes should i should i move this one on now so i can't see the average go down i'll drop those awesome well thank you guys um here by the way i'm going to drop a link into your chats this nosqlbench.slack.com if you have questions if you have follow-up if you have things that you are you know you want more information go there ask they have the whole team there um so i just dropped those links for you oh there you go thank you shooky shooky's dropping some sign up links as well all right wonderful thank you for the comments there okay how long do you think these workshops last we've been doing this two hour thing um we have done other ones we've done three hours we've done half a day so on and so forth we're trying to get a feel for what a good sweet spot is hey carl it should be go to the top ten hey make sure you get your voucher all right cool so good um yeah we have actually kind of thought about you know should we shorten some of these but it does seem like uh generally we're getting a good sweet spot between two and three hours um surprising until my eyes bleed i feel like that depends on what part of the world you ask all right thank you all right how easy was it to get help during the workshop again be frank with these we want you guys to be honest it's important and for those of you who answer you know if you answer uh in the somewhat easier below not that i don't want to hear from the others as well um but feel free to hit us up on the discord tell us what what troubles did you have right again i know that we had some difficulty with catacota today i appreciate your patience but we want to know because we want to make that better we want to fix that stuff for the future all right thank you and how easy was it to attend to get on the discord youtube how easy were you able to get those links okay good that sounds like that's pretty good that sounds like it's pretty pretty easy to focus on those channels and folks are able to get there i'm glad to see it and then finally this is a multi-part you can choose as many as are relevant to you how do you hear about us excellent thank you thank you thank you all right so thank you so much again everybody for coming on today i really appreciate you taking the time and and checking us out um we have all sorts of more events if you take a look at our youtube channel you'll find that there are previous videos from previous workshops all the material that we have is all online and all open it's for you to use however you see fit and always always always i'm going to drop this link again always feel free to come and reach out to us if you have any questions follow-up questions whatever it is don't be shy right we are here for you so let me drop this link here is the github repo um and again for the catacota stuff i have a feeling since we're done inundating them if you try it again a little bit later um usually they're pretty they're pretty flawless so i think they just kind of got a little overrun there but either that or if you take a look at the github repo here all of the materials all of the instructions all the walkthroughs are all here in the github repo as well and thank you thank you guys so much and we'll see you later you",
