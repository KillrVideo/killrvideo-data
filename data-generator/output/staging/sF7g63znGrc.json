    "text": "and hello everybody welcome to our building microservices with cassandra and corkus workshop today i'm joined by a gaggle is it a gaggle what how many is actually in a gaggle i think gaggle's a good word a flock today i'm joined by a flock of wonderful individuals uh let's see going going from me and moving over to the right we have peter humphrey hello peter and then moving over to eric d'andrea did i say did i say it right this time eric i've been working on that like all week close enough okay close enough that's close enough and finally sebastian estevez hello books hello yeah welcome um so um eric is from red hat i mean i will give everybody a moment to kind of explain you know uh where they're from and who they are and such but needless to say the folks that are over on the well i should point this way over on the other side are far more of experts in what we're going to be doing today than i am um so put all of your hard questions to them that's for eric and seb all the hard questions go to eric and sub uh anyway so with that why don't we go and just talk quickly about the agenda today if you could move forward there we go okay so um we're going to cover three things and one of those is going to i'm going to going to get into live coatings we're going to have some live coding and we're going to watch said type in a keyboard and hopefully that goes all well um so the first thing is quarkus we're going to talk about quarkus what that is you know why quercus how does it work eric is going to give us the skinny on all of that information then we're going to move into astra right and so astra is data sexes cassandra as a service in the cloud serverless um service lots of s's in there um and it's it's honestly it's it's pretty wonderful it gives you a nice mechanism to stand up a cassandra database within a couple minutes right and why are we bringing that here because we're going to hook that up to corkus we're going to show you how easy that really is and then seven eric they're going to take it they're going to go into some live coding and they're going to build up an app from scratch with quarkus and hook it up in astra and do the whole thing um peter eric seb anything i missed there that you want to add before we get going you covered it yeah i just i'm looking forward to the live coding i mean i think uh exceptions will be thrown you know tears will will be cried things will break uh and i'm i'm excited to to to hopefully try to humiliate seb as much as possible while he's going you know i hope i hope you guys got the buckets i sent you i did send you to your buckets so thank you thank you yeah i'm gonna need it live live coding is ill advised but fortunately i think um we got eric here to yell at me when i do stupid stuff and no mechanical keyboard will be harmed in the making of this youtube live stream that's right possibly go wrong live coding in front of hundreds of people yeah exactly exactly so and as usual before we get started here as usual for all of you who are joining us um in the chat ask your questions don't be shy right that's what we're here for we're watching um the the questions that come in so we'll do our best to try to ensure that we can you get things addressed as they come in um but like i said don't be shy and eric with that let's let's do it man all right next slide is my audio okay yeah and everyone i believe that we're getting good sound checks but um you know if you can give us a thumbs up in the chat let us know that you can hear us and see us okay and go ahead all right moving awesome so let's talk a little bit about corka supersonic subatomic java if we were in a in a room with with all these people here so i would reach out to the audience and say you know raise your hand if you've ever heard of corkus and we get some people and then i'd say keep your hand raised if you've ever built anything with corcus and you probably see you know some hands come down hopefully hands stay up so what we're going to try and do is give you a quick overview because i know we want to get to some of the live coding stuff but we definitely want to give you some background as to what we're doing and why it's important so next slide please so if we kind of take a little history lesson right this might give away my age a little bit but java was invented back when i was in college so this was about 25 years ago so you know got a bunch of engineers here so you can do the math 25 years ago back in 2020 think about the problems java was invented to solve the the right ones run anywhere right and so if you think about what the jvm did for for a long period of time you know you it was tailored for running these large large workloads that ran for days weeks months at a time you know other than the typical hey we need to bounce our app every night because it fixes some problem that we never figured out what the actual problem was um but adding on to that you've got like millions and millions tens of millions of developers worldwide that are using the platform that are building applications that are helping organizations run their businesses successfully on these uh with these applications right so java really has become and continues to be the enterprise workhorse but really java was invented in a time where things like the cloud you know the cloud solves all problems right that where cloud containers kubernetes and whatnot don't didn't exist so you know the days where hey i need an application environment where you know on my developer workstation i can run my app maybe eclipse and but not outlook or anything else right because of the the huge memory overhead that that it took um so thinking about that the applications would live you know for weeks or months and um as a developer i couldn't i couldn't do um a lot of heavy heavy lifting stuff so as new development approaches you know microservices or whatever it is that you want to call them you know ask two people what a microservices you get two completely different answers but you know java really continued to remain relevant in in the market you know there's lots and lots of different microservice frameworks out there based on java jbm you know you got spring you got microprofile drop wizard kotlin scala you know micron all all that kind of stuff so the stack of the application itself hasn't really changed too much but really what's changed is the environment in which we're running these applications so rather than having an application that's you know maybe takes minutes to start up you know uses you know three four five gigs of heap space and whatnot and stays you know active for for a long period of time we're kind of now in the in the place where these applications come and go a lot faster meaning you know i'm scaling up i'm adding more instances of these applications so startup time really starts to become important and the the write once run anywhere paradigm of why java was invented in the first place isn't as important yeah there are plenty of people who run um application java applications on non-linux or unix-based platforms but the vast majority of our deployments these days are on on linux so if we know ahead of time what's going to happen and where these applications are going to be deployed why do we need to do all the same stuff that the jvm does at runtime i mean if you're if you're not familiar with what the jvm does there's a ton of stuff that happens like in the first two seconds of when a jvm starts up so um i'm not a jvm engineer so i'm not gonna to bore you with all the details but just just take it on blind faith that there's a ton of stuff that happens there and so if you're gonna run the same instance of the same application over and over and over again why should you have to do that every single time you start your application and that's really the foundation of of quarkus to try and reduce the amount of stuff that the that we have to do at run time and shift a lot of that to to do it at other points in time rather than at run time and that helps to support things like you know cloud native micro services serverless event driven applications where you know pure performance and startup time is is super super important all right you know excellent yeah eric before you move on to the next slide um i actually have a couple questions that came in but i did want to ask about the unicorn um i i feel like the evolution from you know like horses various horses and then unicorn like that's a that's a huge uh that's an awesome evolution honestly it feels so powerful right yep it just seems natural right you go from a horse to a unicorn totally totally but no i actually do have some questions that i'm seeing that i think are relevant now you might be addressing these later so please just tell me if that's the case i'm seeing a whole set of questions come in um how is corcus different from micronaut or um is quercus a direct alternative for spring boot and micronaut right so i'm seeing a couple of those from different folks is that something you're gonna address later maybe you can just let me keep that in the back of my mind and kind of frame it as we move through and by the end if you don't have a definitive answer you know we can certainly address it got it thank you and that time eric i'm also going to pipe some answers into the chat on that one while you're talking awesome all right so kind of going back to what's what's the underlying run time corkus was born to one of the key things is is very low memory utilization and smaller footprint meaning if you're in a platform where you're running multiple applications on a host you know you know aka kubernetes or something like that you know some container runtime platform you want to be able to run more things given the same underlying you know hardware or resources right so being able to stuff more things is better for your business because you don't have to buy additional hardware or expand your clusters or whatnot so really shrinking the amount of footprint both from cpu memory whatnot and startup time is one of the one of the founding pillars around containers you know we say container first that you know people sometimes will read into that hey does that mean i can only run it in containers you know absolutely not you know it just it runs on a jvm just like any other any other java application but what's really really interesting is this this concept of native image so i like i alluded to before having an application if we know that your eventual run time is going to be a container which is most likely going to be linux some some flavor of linux um hopefully rail but you know i'm a red header i have to say that um but if you know that you're going to do that well then we can actually eliminate the jvm from from the stack completely now that being said there's i'm not going to necessarily go into it but there's reasons as to when and why you might want to eliminate the jvm and go native and there's reasons why you you don't um we can certainly have a follow-on conversation about that because there are caveats to that meaning like things like think about like monitoring or jmx or you know java agents and all those kinds of things those those things aren't going to be available for your application when it's running in native mode but the native mode does give you a ton ton of benefit so eric like i think the slide blows some minds because you're basically telling me i can run my java app in 12 megs uh and it'll start up in a hundredth of a second and like that's something that i thought you know to get that i had to like rewrite my app in another language right yep yeah we'll talk about that yeah pretty cool yeah yeah so in some of these metrics and whatnot i mean we've got we've got everything published in a github repo like with benchmarking and whatnot but essentially this this this time to start up this isn't necessarily just startup time it's also time for first request through a system right so you know just starting up in four seconds is great but if it takes 10 seconds for that first request to go through your app that's a different that's a different story right all right so let's go on to the next one all right developer joy so the the one of the other things about java or that java developers have been missing for quite some time if you're familiar with things like node.js and whatnot is hey i write some code i go test it i write some code to go test it you know what's this compilation and restarting and all that kind of stuff that i thought i have to do so being able i grew up in the in the portal world and the you know the java ee world where you've got these heavyweight containers or not java not docker containers but you know application server containers running where every time you you made a change you know and you had to recompile and rebuild and redeploy even on your local machine i mean that was minutes you know if not ten tens of minutes um depending on which which platforms you were using so trying to optimize the developer experience around the saving the time it takes from hey i make a change how do i test it or how do i see that change running but not having to have to learn something you alluded to to learn something new so a developer doesn't necessarily have to learn a whole new thing to to be able to do that so we'll talk about some of these standards in a minute what's that xkcd where like i think he's like playing with swords and stuff like well let's go i'm totally yeah someone will drop it in the chat yeah that's pretty funny hey hey real quick eric i think i already know the answer to this i i think it's it might be um obvious given our conversations but is um is quercus only for java or is it supported in any other languages so quarkus is just for java so i'm not going to talk too much about crawl vm and whatnot in this but essentially crawl vm is aimed for for at least for native compilation is is polyglot so supporting you know other things outside of java with quarkus we're just targeting java or you know java variants like kotlin and whatnot and and and uh carcass does depend on crawl vm for the native compilation stuff so yeah on substrate yes for substrate yes so there's a there's a downstream distribution so growl vm is an is an oracle product and you know there's licensing issues that come with with with that so for corcus on linux we've we've built uh a downstream distribution called mandrel which is completely open source it's rebased on open jdk and only has the parts of graw vm that are needed to compile quarkus apps into native applications and it's completely open source and supported by red hat for that oh cool okay i didn't know that that's awesome yep and then the the generation from from native as well so if you've ever tried to to build a native image or use grovium kind of on on its own there's just a lot of stuff that you got to do there's lots of configuration lots of parameters and whatnot so being able to run hey maven package and pass it a flag to say yeah build me a native image is is kind of cool oh yeah like i was i was trying to wrap like i was trying to wrap the cassandra driver um in a native image about a year year ago a year and a half ago maybe and it was like a huge huge pain with like all the gravity m flags and stuff and like figuring out what packages needed to be brought in and stuff and today we can just do it it's it's wonderful with with carcass and the uh and the extension we'll talk more about that later tip but do you need uh do you need to have goral vm installed in the machine uh adrian asks or is it just uh only you used to build the native image as long as we're here eric yeah yeah so to build a native image you need either grawl vm on the machine or it can be done in a container so the the maven plugin can use you can point it to like a container image that will actually do the build so if you have access to you know kubernetes or something you might not have it on your local machine your local machine might be walked down by you know your you know enterprise security team or it teams you can facilitate the build through a container image and then that can produce your native image for you then but then that the the growl vm installation is only needed when you build the native image not when you actually run it cheers i will say that's of interest like maybe we can throw that maybe we can take a stab at that at the end of the hacking session maybe we can do the next webinar but let's see let's see how time treats us yeah i will say native image compilation is time consuming and it takes you know a ton of ram to to do so you definitely need some hardware in order in order to do it i mean i can do it on my my mac here but it's it does depending on the size of your app how many libraries and whatnot you're importing it can take a couple of minutes to actually do the build yeah all right so another thing that um still that developers find challenging today is this whole imperative versus reactive and so you know is imperative is it a programming paradigm is it an architecture you know reactive is it a you know a way to write code is it an architecture well the answer is it's really both and with quarkus from a programming paradigm perspective caucus doesn't really care what you want to do if you want to write reactive code like in this example here you want to stream data from kafka and write it out as a server sent event you know using reactive paradigms great go for it um the if you want to do imperative you know the traditional way of doing hey i inject beans and i return return things um great so at like i said at the end doesn't it doesn't really matter so that being said under the covers corkus embraces a fully reactive uh processing engine based on vertex so those who aren't familiar with what vertex is or the eclipse vertex project is a really lightweight and super fast uh framework for building reactive applications and cork is sits on top of that so it uses a lot of the underpinnings and so yep next slide yep yep and so you might we kind of alluded to this this earlier so do you how do i get this benefit this all sounds really cool do i need to learn vertex or do i need to learn some new stuff do i need to learn how to use crawl vm the answer is really no it's at the end of the day it's all still java and it's probably java that you're already using today so if you're using things like jax rs or hibernate or integration with kafka or you know flyway or any of these these libraries cdi you know dependency injection jackson great continue to use them and corcus really tries to not get in your way of using them it's really there in the background i think when seb does some of his live coding you're going to see for the most part there's there's really not anything cork in them in air quotes here corkusy that yet that you're doing here yeah for the most part for the most part it just removes some of the boiler plate right i mean that's kind of how i see it so so this is kind of like i think maybe a meta question eric in a way because you know obviously this is implemented with java right i saw a question come in though why java you know of you know why this language uh why provide corcus here instead of some of the other languages or something yeah i mean if you think about i mean organizations have a huge investment in java i think that there was a survey and i can get the the link to it but it's like what 13 billion dollars is the the java server market today or 2018 or 2019 something it's huge and there's there's millions and millions of developers out there that know java use java and have worked with java so these organizations that especially these larger organizations they just can't afford to throw it all away i mean they've got a huge investment in it so why not continue that investment in it yeah yeah there's also like the kind of the human capital part of it like folks already have java chops right um we also we're talking about like carcass and cassandra here as well like together so just from from that perspective you know you can talk to cassandra from lots of different programming languages we got lots of drivers but by far the data cassandra java driver is like the most widely used one and yeah just kind of comes down to what big enterprises use for for their code yeah okay cool thank you yep yeah so let's talk just a little bit and again i'm not i'm not an engineer on the corcus team so i'm sure if somebody asks low-level questions i i'm not going to know exactly the answer but typically when you look at a java framework or java application in general you know you've got this this build time versus runtime separation and traditionally you know you build your application or you build your jar your war whatever it is that you're building then that gets deployed and the jvm fires up you know it finds config files parses it looks at class path scanning you know some some frameworks are really you know annotation driven and whatnot it's going through your class structure looking for annotations and you know doing stuff or loading extra classes or you know doing stuff based on what it finds it at runtime and then it kind of builds its model of the world of what what the paths through this application look like and then it starts things so think about like database connection pools you know incoming request thread pools all that kind of stuff it's got to start all that management around all that kind of stuff and that you know when i alluded to earlier the you know the first two or three seconds that a jvm starts is all the stuff that happens then as your application runs you'll notice your app typical java applications will perform better over time because over time the jvm is watching what your application is doing and doing you know just in time compilation and reorganizing the byte code and doing all kinds of stuff to to adapt to what your application is doing you know we kind of call it warming you know we warm the the application up a little bit if you go to the next slide you know what we do with corcus is it you know it looks very similar but we try and do as much of that stuff at build time as possible so all that you know the class compilation and all that kind of stuff yeah we we do that but then all this other stuff that's repetitive and redundant you know if you think about containers say you know containers ephemeral you have nobody or hopefully you're not going into a running container and modifying its configuration because if that container image or instance goes away the next one that starts up isn't going to have whatever changes you made right so if we think about hey we're going to run if we know we're going to run these in containers if i want to change or alter the functionality of an application i should do it in a way that signifies the change meaning like make a code check-in go through my ci cd pipeline produce a new version of the image that represents whatever that change in behavior was right and once i'm there then we've been able to do the majority of that stuff ahead of time at build time and then the run time becomes super super fast so there's actually byte code that's generated and inserted at build time that's kind of stored off as part of the the artifact that's built between the build and the run time and then you know you can still run it on the jvm i mean there are plenty of reasons you know just because you have the capability to do native image doesn't mean native image is the best solution for all problems right it's a solution for for some problems that we'll talk about in a minute but it's running you know a corkus application like jvm is still going to outperform a lot of the the other frameworks and whatnot that are out there today all right next one and then just a couple of couple use cases to to wrap up you know your net new microservices mono to monolith to microservices serverless event driven reactive iot so you know a framework for you know being able to build your containerized microservices you know the unification of both the imperative and reacting programming styles even within the same class you know i mentioned corkus doesn't really care which one you do and how you do it you know even within the same jax rs class i can have a reactive endpoint and an imperative endpoint caucus doesn't really care right and we'll we'll see that i think in a little bit of the live coding you know it's a great tool for modernizing monolithic applications breaking them into smaller more loosely coupled microservices you know whether you're going to run it on a you know traditional you know a jvm or you know a server or whatnot being able to eliminate some of those those long boot up times serverless corkus makes a really good use case for running servos applications so anybody who's done like azure function or aws land or whatnot you know i think there was a study that came out that was like six percent of people actually use java to build serverless applications on these cloud platforms well with quarkus why not i can write the application once and truly run it anywhere especially that these these providers allow you to to run container images as serverless applications and by serverless i don't necessarily mean functions as a service i mean like full-blown applications that scale down to zero and go away when they're when they're not being used you know functions as a service is definitely something you know that falls into this rom that you can do quarkus has this thing called funky which is its functions as a service implementation but you know there's an extensive library of stuff and again in air quotes here stuff to to choose from to be able to use and we'll see some of that in the in the live coding here one last one on use cases uh while we're here um someone asking if we could use quarkus for javascript or node i'm imagining yes javascript is a front-end you know full-page page app but uh probably not node i'm guessing so corkus is is is a java framework so yeah you can hook up you know through http or whatnot whatever you know you can communicate with whatever types of applications you want in your ecosystem but building a corcus application means i'm building a java application yeah i mean we'll so we'll do that coking up today um we'll get into like some front end stuff but but yeah like quartz is a is a just a java back-end thing um but yeah like what kind of what i take away from this and it's all really cool stuff like some of these like cold star problems or some all these all these things about java that makes it sound like it's not going to play well in a modern kind of kubernetes container world uh kind of go away and so i and so i don't have to like go learn golang necessarily right like if i've got a bunch of java chops and skills and and applications so that's super exciting uh then there's this concept of serverless that i think we're gonna dive into uh as well you know as we talk about cassandra and astra um and kind of i've been thinking about that in like there's a thing that forest brazil said i don't know if i'm pronouncing his name right but something that he says is you know when you when you have the serverless mindset you want to build more and own less you know you want to have less responsibility for like running and maintaining systems and just be able to develop and create more solutions um and so that and so like when we say when you know when we're talking about serverless that means uh you know the ability to to take advantage of third-party services like a database as a service uh it also means you know running things in uh um potentially like looking containers and kubernetes as well as the function as a service right not limited to and like um like eric was saying uh okay so so so yeah i can transition a little bit from that to started to start to talk about astra um i think the general flow is going to be like just to make sure that everybody's kind of up to speed on what we're talking about uh a couple of high level slides on what cassandra is and what it does and you know why you would be interested in it and picking it and pick it then a little bit about what astra is which is um as david mentioned our serverless cassandra on the cloud and then we'll get into kind of how this goes really nicely with qarcus and how we can use cassandra and carcass together a little bit about the extension that we built last year so um yeah so apache cassandra is a open source uh apache license and also apache foundation project [Music] it's a distributed database and arguably it's you know the most scalable distributed database out there and so it gets picked to run some of the biggest you know most throughput intensive transactional apps um that you know you might have on your phone um and so you know that includes things like you know a lot of the things on apple icloud and uh a good chunk of spotify and netflix and all these other uh you know big companies and big applications that really need kind of the throughput the availability the geographic distribution um and the performance that the cassandra gives you uh as well as kind of the open source nature so um just a little bit about how cassandra works and i think we'll do a little bit of data modeling in the live coding part so just i figured we'd do a little bit of that a little bit of conversation on that when you've got a cassandra cluster um it's lots of database servers right lots of computers and they all kind of work together uh hanging onto your data and being able to serve requests and so when you have a big table you're able to partition that table based on fields that you control as a as a as a developer and so when you design a sound or table in this case you pick a partition key which is a country and so that means that the data will be spread out based on countries uh across your you know let's say you have a thousand node cluster right and so actually country is not a great key because depending on your app you might have you know a lot of your workload in a couple of countries and so your partitioning might be pretty skewed but just to give an example of how that would work out you know a set of your nodes might be responsible for the records that happen in the u.s and another set of nodes may be responsible for the records that happen in france etc so there's partitioning there and uh we were able to split the data up now that doesn't mean that you have to kind of know what cassandra note to ask a question to um any cassandra node can you know take any put or get and then it does kind of coordinating behind the scenes to actually either persist or fetch the data that you want um so another key thing about cassandra is that it's it's got you know geographic distribution and replication built in and so uh there's a concept of a data center in cassandra which in today's world we map to you know more most often you know either your physical on-premises data centers or the region that you're operating in a cloud in a cloud and so you can have single clusters that span a geographic regions that span data centers and span clouds uh you know in sickle cluster and then you keep end replicas of your data you know across all across all of those data centers and so that lets you do things like get geo local latencies for your application so if your app is running in the east or the west of the us they would talk to the database data center in that local data in that local data center and get geo local latencies but still replicate that data everywhere in case you need it in case you need to reach it from the other side of the world yeah so that's a little bit on data everywhere and then again to talk about use cases kind of why do people why do people use in pick cassandra um i think historically uh folks pick it when cassandra win they have kind of very intense scalability availability distribution requirements um and so that means you know very large applications um and you know if you're deploying your own cassandra cluster there's let's say like a cost of entry there of like standing up a cluster learning how learning how to run it learning how to operate it and like pay for the physical infrastructure to run that cluster in that is probably not insignificant right and so one of the things that you know astra is doing and especially you know our serverless version of astra that was gad i think last month is it brings that kind of barrier of entry for using cassandra pretty much down to zero right so um so yeah data sex astra is our cassandra on the cloud and it's serverless basically we give any user that creates a database 25 free every month so those 25 dollars kind of reset at the end of the month um and that's equivalent for um you know that lets you do like you know tens of millions of ops in the month or uh hold on to you know gigabytes of data uh etc and then you know we'll reset that at the end of the month and you know if you go above that then you can put in your credit card and you know pay for your usage and you could build based on your throughput basically the operations that you that you do against the database like so you'll get bills per million ups uh and you'll get bills or like amount of data actually stored in the system so some 25 25 a month i mean help me get my head around that like what does that mean yeah so i think if you look at the pricing um so there's different pricing for reads and writes but like a million writes on like one of the google regions is about is about a dollar so let's say that you know that would be 25 million rights i think reads are like a third of that price something like that you can check it on the website to be exact but that means that you could do 75 million writes in the month for free um it's like it's hefty like we could all run our side projects on this thing for free we could probably prototype stuff you know and and even do development for like significant apps for free and then you know only if you get only if you had morality are you going to like you know pay for it and um yeah it's it's actually a nice deal uh so yeah i think it was uh i think on the north american gcp data center we benchmarked it at like 30 million rights 5 million reads and 40 gig a month within the 25 crit yeah that's what that 25 means yeah so that's right cool just trying to make that a little so a couple other things on this slide that i skipped there's powerful apis which i know people want me to talk about um so astra not only supports cassandra query language which is the thing that we're going to use today but it also supports uh different additional apis so one of them is a json document api that basically is a rest interface directly against your database and so you can just persist your your json objects directly to the database kind of without a query language uh it also supports graphql endpoints as well as uh you know table based restful endpoints uh and you can and you can leverage those you know directly from your app without like using a driver or anything like that um so that's that's an option in addition to cql for folks that you know aren't already familiar with and using cassandra but want to take advantage of some of these capabilities um yeah and then we can also we also run on uh you know the multiple clouds um and it's designed to be you know cloud native and what we mean by that especially in the serverless uh mode is like just the storage and the computing cassandra are actually separated uh under the hood and so what that gives you is the capability to it gives off the capability of auto scaling for you automatically and so you know you don't have to think at all about uh kind of how much throughput you need to purchase in advance or how many nodes you need to be running or all kind of the complexities of running a database right it's all kind of auto scale under the hood for you so that's a little bit about astro um i think i already covered this stuff so i'm going to go ahead and skip it um i want to talk very briefly about migrations so if you are running cassandra yourself on premises and you want to move it to astro we have some very nice tooling to do that including the ability to move the data over move your applications over without any downtime right so definitely reach out to us if that's of interest and then i'm going to move on a little bit to talk about quercus and cassandra together so i want to say about a year and a half ago something like that you know i've been poking around uh using quarkx and cassandra together and uh our drivers team got interested in that and they built a really cool extension so the way you guys will see this as we kind of get into the live coding but the way quark is kind of is laid out is it works uh based on extensions and so all the different java libraries that you're used to using uh a lot of them are have extensions in quarkx and you can go pick those out and grab them and throw them in your palm and you're ready to roll so the features of our quarakkis cassandra extension include native compilation which we talked a bunch about already with eric the cassandra driver session support so if you've used the cassandra datastax driver there's some configuration and some work from boilerplate that you do to establish to even get a cluster object going um all that stuff is kind of done for you based on a native quarkx configuration um there's also support for the object mapper so for those of you that are using relational um and use things like hibernate you know those are orms uh in the cassandra world because we're not a relational database we don't do orms we use the oms so the datasets driver has an object mapper and there's their support for that here in the park in the cargo extension yes very zen the we do support mutiny types which is if you want to get into that some of that reactive style coding that eric was talking about um that's supported and we have some nice dots on how to do that i think we're going to stay away from the reactive stuff on the demo today but we there's plenty of good documentation for that if folks are interested um and yeah and also there's also support for datasets astra on the cloud so here's the configuration and what it looks like quercus has an application.properties file where you throw in you know dot separated config and um yeah and that's separated config and so this is these are the options that like some of the options that are there for the for the cassandra extension um one of them being so that's the first one at the top is secure connect bundle and we'll talk a little bit more about that when we go spin up a database but that's basically a zip file that the astra service provides to you as a user to enable to enable you to connect to the service and that includes you know certificates and other security things uh as well as like a a fully disqualified domain that you actually use to connect it's all it all goes into a zip file to kind of make connecting easy and so that zip file is supported by uh the extension um we also have you can also specify key space you can specify credentials username password um and some other driver level config like timeouts and consistency levels uh and then at the bottom we'll talk a little bit more about this with eric we have metrics in health which are basically integrations with other partners extensions that give you things like metrics and health which are going to be useful to you if you uh are looking to like observe your app with prometheus or something like that uh also useful do you insert the health is useful to you if you're um you know running in kubernetes and you know kubernetes needs like a health and a live and a liveness endpoint right so those kind of get built for you automatically and we'll you know and so it'll show us up and healthy and live uh once you know cassandra's connected is connected from the driver so just a little bit of config gets you a whole bunch of you know value and stuff that you used to have to code um so this is what this is this single line is what it looks like to get to connect to cassandra once you have the config right you literally just inject a qrcql session give it a name and from your class you are able to actually you know start executing queries right away it's pretty slick uh this is what the object mapper support looks like um so you can create baos and um take advantage of the of the object mapping support in the driver um and this is what the mutiny uh like reactive style of interactions looks like if that's kind of your your style of choice right so you can um subscribe and publish stuff and do streaming um so great last bit i mentioned that we have additional developer endpoints that are in astra um those are like the json document api the graphql there's also a couple sdks the javascript sdk is already available there's a java sdk coming soon so if you were to try if you were told if you needed to use let's say the json document api from a quercus app then you would use the quark as rest client extension instead of the cassandra one um and there's you know some samples of what those apis actually look like on the right but it basically it's nice it lets you just take a json blob and post it and just post it to a collection of the database right like you're like you're using a documentdb um awesome so yeah so that's the that's the bit around what cassandra is what astra is what the cassandra quarkus extension is all about are there any questions before we kind of jump into the scary part of this which is where i try to code and ideally not mess up i think eric and peter have been all over them uh unless there's something uh between you guys that you want to address that you see uh in the chats yeah i mean i think the the theme i see in the chat if i could have i can narrow because like it's like scrolling faster than i can yeah yeah by the way we love your questions in the conversation so by all means keep that going yeah i will say the the overall theme i'm seeing is like comparing it to things like spring and whatnot and i i'm not here to to throw anybody under under the bus or anything but that's certainly not what we're trying to do here but if someone had asked about like how do i know like i'm a spring shop how do i know about migrating in my app you know i throw a couple links in the chat there there is a compatibility layer so there it you can continue to use some spring apis in corkus um that being said it's not meant to implement the entire spring framework and re-implement the entire spring framework on on quarkus it's more of a hey i'm familiar with spring can i get started and can i learn um as i you know try to tinker and play with it and still get the benefit of it and so the answer to that is yes but it's not meant to be a whole um and eric you know i think it might be interesting just to to acknowledge one last thing which is like you know spring boot generally defaults to like either tomcat or nettie depending on whether you're going the reactive or non-reactive uh direction i know there are other options you know it used to be at least for things like undertow et cetera you talk you know a lot of questions in the chat are about the programming model and i think one of the things that that uh i really intrigued me about what you what i learned talking to you was the difference in the runtime um you know that that uh quarkus and how you approach the unified reactive yeah so at the at the at the underpinning corcus is based on a reactive engine that uses it that reuses what's already available through vertex so the the whole reactive capability that that vertex provides it's somewhat hidden from you in quarkx so you don't really necessarily have to i mean you certainly can if you if you're familiar with vertex and you want to use some of the vertex stuff in quarkus you know by all means go for it but uh it really tries to hide that away from you that being said the a lot of the specifications that are out there like jax rs or gpa are just that their specifications right most of the time i mean i know jersey was i saw in the chat was mentioned like for for as a jax rs implementation there are other implementations of a lot of these things especially from from micro profile and so corkus brings in a lot of these other implementations of of stuff so for like jax rs you've got rest easy um as the the implementation for for jax rs and under the covers all that bridging between reactive you know the i o threads you know someone who's familiar with like spring web flux as an example has to like be absolutely certain that what they're doing in their code doesn't do blocking work right because you're on the you have to be super super careful about the i o thread corcus just kind of handles that for you and there's a couple different ways and we'll talk about it when um i was kind of saving that for when seb starts to go into his um sure sure yeah i just thought that uh yeah um it's good to kind of separate the the conversations for programming model versus runtime because there are significant differences in both but i think to your point there's a lot of like moral equivalent programming you know uh programming model and api structures on both sides um you know but there's a lot of differences in the runtime cool thanks eric yep awesome um david's flag reminder oh yeah that's right so a matter of fact i was just responding to coder over at discord about that very thing uh so i guess i'll just say it in voice instead of trying to type it out um we we we actually have a couple things that we're going to give away for all of you coming with us today um but you gotta you gotta stay with us you gotta you gotta you have to go through the tears of watching seb code live um but then at the end we will drop a link for you to get some red hat swag now eric there's gonna be tears of joy right the cheers from seb and replacement tears of joy um so we will drop a link uh for that at the end for you to get some swag there now that swag is limited right and we have enough folks on here for those who want to get it when we drop it do it quick right now we're going to also have another giveaway for you though we're going to drop a form uh to get you one of two things and one it could be a free voucher for two attempts at a cassandra certification those are 145 bucks a piece normally um the other option is to get yourself 300 in astro credit and uh again we'll drop that at the end so so there's yes there's swag and there's the other giveaways and with that uh i think we can we can start into our tier journey so david you're gonna drop your database at the end second you're gonna drop the database at the end yeah nice nice peter it looks pretty crazy man right right i'm thinking i think i'm going to use that from now on let's drop the database yeah okay it's very good all right so i'm going to summarize what i'm going to do with this live coding and uh there will be a lot of help from eric and the team as i mess up but one we want to deploy a database in astro two we're gonna create from scratch a quarkus application then three there's a little sample app that's relatively well known it's called a to do mvc um basically what that thing is is like a very simple to-do list application i think the one we picked is react on the front and no back end and we're just going to kind of reverse engineer the back end fill in the endpoints using quarkus and cassandra to hopefully at the end of the at the end of the session actually make it run and then finally we'll get into the swag stuff right on so um i'll start with deploying the cassandra database um so if i go to astro.datasex.com and i sign in you can either create a user with your email and password or you can use social logins um you will see this screen which is basically a dashboard and we have i have three databases that i've deployed and i'm going to go ahead and deploy a fourth one just to show you how it works so it's really pretty simple stuff i think there's three things i have to do i have to give my database a name squaricus and cassandra and i'm going to give my key space a name and we're going to call it to do and then i have to pick where i want to deploy this uh this database so today uh astro serverless has options for deployment in multiple google and amazon regions we do have azure coming soon and so i'm just gonna pick aws us east and that's it so i create my database and you can see that it's coming up here status pending it usually takes a couple minutes for that database to come up and so in the meantime i'll switch over to one that we've used in the past and so you can see that i've performed some operations against this database i've written 5.9 million rights against it done a lot less reading i've got you know a few hundred megs in there and so far that that this database has cost me five dollars and ninety seven cents out of my free 25 gigs for the month or 25 bucks for the month um yeah and you can see like some other things like what provider i'm running on and the fact that i've got a couple of key spaces so uh one thing i can do is jump into my cql console and let's see if i've got this table already created or not i think i might not and i want to drop it before we do anything else so i'm going to describe my key spaces what's a key space i actually should have described let's describe what that is the key space is just a grouping of tables in cassandra and ion our friend ion in uh youtube earlier said you usually drop the database and prod when your morning is very boring we're not going to drop one right now but i'm gonna drop it you know if you like doing that for your mornings that's great it's a good man to test your monitoring right and see who's paying attention yeah right yeah or your user base list have you guys seen that write a stat developer story in three words meme going around i think one of the top responses was like drop table and like two million rows updated [Laughter] like oh no no i think we've all had a moment where we've done something terrible to a database i uh i one time dropped i i was on the wrong database i never made this mistake ever again i thought i was on my dev database i was on prod and i dropped six months worth of device data from thousands of our servers and network devices that was a oops moment and that was with oracle and that was uh our using our man and stuff if anyone's ever done that so it's going back a little bit anyway with cassandra but user error is still user error yeah yeah exactly what the cloud doesn't solve that problem for you oh yeah yeah cute unicorn slide so i think we've got a database going and i'm going to switch over and talk about quarkus a bit um so this is this is one of the parts where one of the multiple parts of today where eric's gonna help me not mess stuff up but if you go to code.quarters.io then this is a very handy kind of web page to get your carcass app started uh this isn't the only way to do this you can do this on your terminal and you can also do this using one of using your favorite ids quarkx extension uh but let's start with the web it's actually very nice and so you can see here that it's basically a list of extensions that i um that i may or may not be interested in and for today's uh for today's application we need something that lets us do rest endpoints so we're going to pick rest eec jackson and let's see what else do i want yeah so maybe it's a good time just to talk like quickly what an extension actually is so oh yeah great yeah so we talked about you know corker's doing a whole lot of stuff at build time and then a whole lot of stuff you know i'm going to put in your quotes here right extensions are the way corcus accomplishes that so corkus has extensions that the corkus team themselves builds and there's also extensions that are built by others in the community you know why we're here today so whatever it is that you're looking to do something like build a jax rs application or something you're going to want to go find the extensions and the vast majority of what an extension does is that optimizate that build time optimization to make it super super fast right the folks building the extensions there's a whole set of practical best practices guides and things that they have to adhere to but that's you know part of part of building the extension so what we'll do here you know i'm gonna you know shame on seb for a second um yeah so we should actually use the rest easy reactive extension and i'll explain why so rest easy being the the jax rs implementation you know you find rest easy like if you're using like wildfly or jboss eap or any of these things as a as the official jax rs implementation um rest easy reactive and you know it says experimental there that just because it's new that doesn't change the way you actually build your application so like we could get through this whole demo today and then go back and swap the dependency and seb wouldn't have to change the line of code what the difference between rest easy reactive and the you know what we call rest easy classic is is pure performance so rest easy reactive is is much much tighter integrated with the whole event loop thing so even if you're going to do blocking work which seb is going to do here it's still a whole lot more a whole lot faster from benchmarking perspective if you're going to do blocking work using rest easy reactive versus doing blocking work and rest easy classic even though your code is exactly the same yeah cause eric's not eric's not the guy doing the live coding so he's okay with using experimental that's right what could possibly go wrong right uh but yeah no so so so we'll so we'll pick yours and and we'll also pick the fighter jet uh the fighter jet one actually fighter jet means that there's some sample code embedded in this extension yeah so that's all that that means uh so i so i got myself the the cassandra extension obviously we need that i got myself rested reactive and also jackson for the serialization serialization we're gonna need something for health right uh small right health and we're gonna need something for metrics oh we're not really going to need them these are kind of like things that yeah if i build my application you know running it locally yeah i probably don't need it but once i go to put it somewhere i need some of this stuff so we're showing off a little bit at this point all right so so yeah because we're going to get kind of health and metrics almost for free um so that'll be nice for free actually yeah now we will yeah we will um even like yeah because because not only do we have the the the health and metrics extensions but also like the integration between them and the cassandra extension um all right cool so so yeah this gives us and i can also like rename stuff so we're going to call this or i don't know um com data stacks demo the artifact is going to be called marcus demo we're going to use maven i like maven i think eric likes gradle but he's going to forgive me we're going to keep coding right yeah that's right we're going to keep the sample code um and then i can just click this button so cool thing you can push this right to github which is interesting so you can get like all this thing all this stuff stubbed out to a brand new github repo which is pretty slick you can share this with your friends drop it on instagram if you want or download it as a zip file which is what we're going to do today and so you can see in my downloads directory i've got a quarkus.demo parker demo zip file and then this very handy instruction set tells me you can run maven w compile and it would just work so let's give that a try i'm going to come down to my terminal you can see that i'm already you guys are seeing my slack so i'm already at my downloads directory and what do we say this thing was called clark's demo so i'm going to go ahead and make a i got a directory called demo and i'm going to unzip my quark is demo not that one that we just downloaded download it if i can spell right here you can see that i've got a marcus demo directory now and if i show tree on it this is basically what we downloaded right so there's a maven w command that's kind of a nice wrapper around maven then there's my palm which might with my dependencies already baked in and you can see it like as you might expect in a traditional java program there's a source main test and resources it does have tests because uh we're gonna attempt to look like real programmers and use unit tests and i'll notice too there's a it generates a whole bunch of docker files for you so you know we talked about different ways of running the app whether it's on the jvm or native image there's already kind of pre-canned docker files there for you that are generated yeah beautiful cool okay so so yeah we're uh we're cloud native here we're we're ready to go on we're gonna we're ready to drop this thing on kubernetes or something all right so we got so we got ourselves a sample project it started and i'm gonna go ahead and pull that up in my ide i have an idea user so let's see idea comes up cedric's like a tree on a mac he's like oh he's on linux oh oh that's funny yeah okay so i'm going to pull open new project from existing sources that's what i want and this is in our downloads directory and it's called quarkus demo we did we ran this we ran through this yesterday with code with carcass so that that's the wrong one uh quarkus demo is the one we just downloaded it's got nothing in it this is a maven project retail idea that we'll open it up in this very window all right so work so maven's going to start downloading the internet for us here in terms of indexing but if i pull up my terminal i'll go ahead and follow the nice instructions also in this readme they were also the same you know the same command that it told me to do on the web um oh hey seb could you could you zoom in your uh screens a little bit make a little bigger yeah absolutely bear with me um actually idea is hanging a little bit here while it downloads the internet so oh that's right you are downloading we're so we're downloading the internet though not the whole world correct what's yeah yeah i think maven downloads the internet npm downloads the world i think right there you go okay i want to make sure i had that right you probably want to make it a little bigger too seb yeah absolutely uh increase font see if i can get that to work there's a helpful comment from the audience about um intellij's presentation mode for future reference yeah we can get into that maybe in a second whatever good point thank you guys does anybody use that mode i think maybe that's the one that we'll try um i don't know how to spell increase just go into your preferences and change the font size change the font size with the mouse wheel should i try that let's try it oh yeah check it out lovely all right so so maven did download some stuff my dependencies and it started out the carcass application and so you you can see that it's telling me that i have a uh that the process is listening on 8080 here on my local host i'm going to open that up in a web browser and so my brand new cloud native application is ready it's pretty slick um and it's cloud native because it says so on the main html here no it does say oh no right there it does yeah yeah it does so it's got native guys ready to roll um our work is done our work here is done right so so uh eric showed me yesterday this super sweet uh little trick that if you go to slash q dev on your um uh on your part if you want to get bigger make it bigger sub flip screen there you go ah too big not too big that big there you go okay so it's got like it's got information about all the uh all the extensions that i brought in and so if i didn't know how to use the apache cassandra extension for example it's got a link right to the docs right that's pretty cool and similarly it's telling me some other things like we turned on we turn on monitoring and health so if i pull up the health section uh eric you're saying i should click on which one of these uh yeah pick one i'll open up the ui because it's human readable and then we'll show what the regular health one looks like for like readiness and liveness if i'm like kubernetes or something programmatic so the ui is going to load the probes and it should tell me that app is alive hopefully oh maybe i don't have any because i haven't done anything yeah okay perfect so if you go to the other one you should just get a json that says okay yeah so actually yeah you're right so so the health ui may may come back and and give me stuff once i start up my my cassandra session hey real quick eric and seb i saw a question um and i i just don't know the answer to this one here um do can they use eclipse with this as well uh i don't see why you wouldn't be able to use any of the ids right yeah there's plugins yeah there's a plugin for eclipse vs code there you go um what's going on i mean you can code and carcass from bim guys like the plugin is nice and i'll show you guys what the plugin does uh one it it does like similar oh why is this blown up oh okay so healthy it's cool um the the plugins is cool because it gives you like a similar flow to start on your application the same way we did here on the web it also is nice for when you're messing with your uh when you're messing with your application properties it's got like autocomplete here um so we'll we'll probably use that in a second um but but yeah like you can code in quarks from from them and just run maven w quark is dev and and go if that's your preference right there isn't like a strong opinionated you must use this id thing um cool so so this this sample app came with some sample code and you can see that it stubbed out a class here called reactive greeting resource which is an endpoint at slash hello rest easy reactive and it says hello so let's actually test that if i copy this and bring it up in my localhost 8080 there you go so it says hello and that's really great now now we're going to get into some of the cool um hot hot code reloading stuff that eric was alluding to like if i wanted to change this to hello this android users and i save that file and i refresh my browser you should get hello cassandra users right in my web browser that's kind of split and you can see i didn't do any like recompiling or anything like that um so i guess at this point is maybe when we so we we've done the part where we deployed a database we've done the part where we created a brand new a quarkus app now we want to get into this uh sample application to-do list thing so maybe what i'll start with is i'll show what the final app should look like so if you guys type into your web browser's uh to do nvc um here we go you can see that like this is a cool example that folks have implemented in all sorts of different front end frameworks and there's even backend frameworks in there too so i'm just going to pick a random one i'll pick the vue.js one which is something i've been using lately and so this is the app and it lets you type type in so we were talking yesterday that eric needs a vacation so get erica vacation is going to be a to-do and so you can see our tv shows up also capital e was super important right it's just a puppy that's right and then i can like check them off as soon as i do them uh try i can check them off that's very satisfying and i can also delete them so this is basically like a very simple to do crud and you can start to kind of imagine uh if you if you start thinking about the database where this whatever staple layer is backing this you need something that holds on to your to-do list i think there's a way to share like a list with somebody else and they can add stuff to it like from different you know computers uh and then you need to be able to hang on to the list items themselves and actually like create them update them delete them uh you need to hold the name of it probably somewhere uh i think we've been calling that title um you need to be able to create new ones you need to be able to complete them you need to be able to delete them so pretty simple kind of crud and so we're gonna go ahead and bring into our sample app uh just the front-end version of this app with none of the back-end wiring and then like we'll see it error out whenever it tries to call a back-end component and then we'll go in and you know without restarting our process we'll just add code and hopefully we'll get this thing to persist to do items to cassandra that's the goal so um the first thing i want to do is i want to serve up some static html and javascript and i want to do that the way to do that is by sticking stuff inside meta and for sources it's basically all it is um that in this index.html file is the pretty um we are cloud native ready thing that we saw in the beginning so i'm gonna go save that as something else um the source resources meta resources so it's index we're going to call that cloud native in the html and then we're gonna go ahead and copy from i have another app here somewhere in my desktop uh quark is demo by the way um maybe this is a good time uh um david if you want to drop the link to the repo yeah in the chat so we've got like the answers to this in a repo called quarks desk cassandra does astra demos and so if you guys want to run through this at home like there's there's there'll be two options one you can pull the main branch and that's got like the solution with all the code and the answer or you can pull your there's another branch in that repo called puzzle if you pull the puzzle branch it's it starts you right here where we're at right now or actually in a second when i've moved the html stuff over and so then you can do your own you know reverse engineer hacking like we're doing today on the uh on the in the session so source main you get to puzzle it out is you can like it's a puzzle all right so i'm going to grab all this stuff from here and we're going to stick it in my source main resources meta don't forget to copy recursively be recursively i messed that up yesterday thank you eric you guys will quickly uh gather that eric's a much better programmer than i and much more detail oriented which is like half the battle um he's like yup i am eric's not shy nothing nothing left for me to say you said it all right that's right that's right check it out we've got a little front end up right so all i did was copy the static html in there quark was smart enough to pull it in and if i pull in my web console here you can see that when i refresh this i'm going to get some errors it tried to let's see it tried to do a get request against local host api to do uh and then this id which i think is the uuid like representation of a to-do list itself not a to-do item but a to-do list and it's trying to pull all the items for that list right obviously that this endpoint does not exist so i get a 400 404 and so we're going to go and figure out if we can actually create that um there's a couple things i have to do first but we'll get into it so first um let's connect to do you want to show the connect to cassandra first before we start building endpoints yeah we gotta connect to cassandra we get a let's let's let's just start by quit by by testing your the the uh the hot reloading capabilities by doing some refactoring with class names what do you think go forward i just had a song popping in my head with hot reloading pop reloading chicken i mean that just dated me as well and sorry for those of you i just brought back to that i was at the 70s or 80s it was the 80s it was ladies that's right hey when i was talking i was i was saying java was born 25 years ago and that i was in college so you know you're an engineer do the math it is funny the 80s are now considered like oldies on the stations what is and you were probably one of the ones in the backseat of your parents car saying oh why you have to listen to the oldie stuff right oh yeah yeah cool so i'm renaming this to api slash health so not only did we change the end point paths but we also like refactor the class name and everything um so that should be a good test of this hot reloading stuff if i say slash api slash when we say hello thought you said health health when i look at it i told you right there that hey did you mean health oh that's really that's really slick that is actually like hey hey you typed something but you maybe you meant this yeah and i actually meant hello all along but but yeah super helpful so this is this developer experience is really nice right yeah it's much nicer than like when you're cobbling together all the different and yeah okay so api hello um worked with all of my uh with all my refactoring with no uh with no uh restarting of the process which is super slick so yeah now we want to connect to cassandra and to do that uh there's a couple of things that need to happen first i'm going to go back to my datasets astra ui and i'm going to show you guys a couple things one is in settings i can generate some credentials the other is going to be ender connect i can download that bundle zip file thing i was talking about let's start with the bundle so under if i go into into connect and i go to java i can download this bundle uh yeah that's fine i think so now it's sitting in my downloads directory and it's called secureconnect serverlessdb um and then i'll go generate credentials later so if we go to the slide deck that we showed earlier today we actually show you guys exactly how to do this i'm just going to pull it right from the slide deck you guys can do this uh at home as well we'll probably publish this 5x somewhere oh yeah i already published the slide deck to the repo so it is in the root of the repo all right okay so then these are the config things and the ones that i care about for right now is just three of these we're gonna grab i don't need a key space i don't care about that we need the path to the connect bundle which is gonna be let's see where i put it you want those other ones too like the health and the metrics too right oh yeah well one health and metrics that's true i'll go grab those in a sec no yeah because we want to show off the health stuff that people folks are thinking that it didn't work it's because we hadn't finished so um secure connect serverlessdb we called it zip yeah so this is my path to that i'm gonna grab it um geez come on and we said it was called secureconnect serverlessdb.zip thanks for bearing with me folks all right so that's the path to the bundle then we're going to need a username and a password now the username uh one of the cool things about astra is that it lets you do kind of granular permissions based on authentication tokens that's pretty slick and so like i'm going to select my role that i that i care about in this case i'm just going to get a database administrator to keep things simple and so when i create that uh and by the way like these secrets details are only gonna be created and showing up once and like you gotta save that csv somewhere somewhere safe uh you won't be able to get it again um but yeah so these are these are these are what i can use to connect and if i grab this token and i use the username token and the password that value then this is enough for me to connect to cassandra um so just these three um things are gonna establish microsoft connection and uh we talked about how you wanna instantiate your session by just copying this one single injection line of code so let's just grab it throw it right into our class here oh can you blow up your code a little bit said absolutely yeah don't actually blow it up all right is that big yeah that's readable it's more readable as in don't explode import and import right now so we've got ourselves a session and so at this point um we should we should be connected to cassandra i'm going to go ahead and do what eric has suggested which is to add the uh metrics and health stuff so we can show that off um so let's add i want to enable metrics in health here and all this stuff is getting picked up on the fly so if i go back to this health ui thing let's see if it actually finds any probes oh check it out so yeah um i'm connected to cassandra and it tells me i'm in us east right that's pretty great um yeah so so uh so we've got a connection established to your database you just created on the cloud right this took us all of i mean if it takes me like two minutes to deploy the database two minutes to you know generate this smartest thing and then like another five minutes because i'm not that smart to like uh set up all the config like we've got ourselves you know a java application using quark is connected to astro on the cloud for free in under 10 minutes uh pretty cool stuff uh this number of node things is actually interesting uh we're using a serverless database so there is no concept of number of nodes i think we need to update some apis of the driver i mean the driver expects nodes right so so i guess it has to show something uh but yeah at the end of the day what it's telling us here is that we're connected and that's great uh in case you don't believe it let's go create like let's go actually like read some data from the database um so we're going to create a new um method here public so one thing to show if you could just expand your imports for a second oh yeah so you notice that there's nothing related to quarkx here i mean this is all standard jax rs and cdi you know context dependency injection stuff there's nothing specific to corcus in here yeah it feels like i'm just coding java right yep but but my dev experience is much nicer public string um get cassandra data we're gonna do so at this point i've got this session thing right and so i can say this that session from any ah not session from anywhere and and if anybody on the call here is uh use the datasets driver you're familiar with the with the session object in the sandra asex driver and i could go ahead and just execute a statement um and in this case i'm just going to go ahead and select star from system local right that's something you're familiar with doing this is going to give you back a result set um which weekend what is this thing called uh get it's like a nice like oh one gives me the first row in that uh result set and then this get formatted contents is like a nice string representation of that um row that first row and i can just return that so if i go oh and then i should tell it all right this is a get it produces a media type and we're going to call this thing tests so if i save my class now i've got a slash api test endpoint that i've created that's going to go over on that cassandra query so let's do it and if everything is well we should actually get some data back and it's waiting what's it waiting for you know i know what it's waiting for oh it blew up did i mess something up so it's waiting because remember we talked about this rest easy reactive versus rest easy classic so you're doing blocking work on the i o thread here so the app is like hosed while you're doing that so you need to to tell rest easy that hey i'm doing stuff moving my work over to a separate thread here at least that's what i think your problem is it's definitely a it's a problem one of the one of the potential multiple problems yeah let's see all right the live demo gods um what happened has been blocked yeah so that sounds right and yeah so so to remove the blocking problem you add the blocking annotation and then quarkx should be smart enough to get me off that i o thread we think um well now what's wrong with it still blocked maybe it's is it still then i kill it and start it over yeah we might have to just because said there's something dumb all right let's kill it oh is this where do we need the bucket do you have the tears bucket i was hoping that we were going to get through this whole thing without killing and restarting corkus dev but yeah i guess there are some dumb things that you can't protect us again we talked about this right you know user error bug lies between keyboard and you know you know one i had one time i was speaking at a conference oh there you go yeah we're in business one time i was speaking in a conference and i had a user or i had an attendee ask if cassandra is so robust and resilient why do you need backups and my answer was it's not because of the database it's because if someone truncates or drops something that you shouldn't have truncated or dropped or whatever that way you definitely worked with folks that hey i've got three replicas so i've got two backups um and that's how they around production um they've got the best play but definitely i've definitely encountered that in my time with the yeah running um okay so cool we're able to get some data from the database in a blocking method um so now we're almost at the part where we can start filling in stubbing out um this app how are we doing time-wise by the way oh we're good got over here we've got we've got another 40 minutes uh perfect yeah okay great so so the next thing eric is we're going to do some fancy carcass stuff to actually do something on startup right which is create the table um so to do that i said i think we said we're going to do a public void method that that is subscribed to the startup event right yep and so that takes an annotation that i forget but you i'm sure you remember start something observes observes yeah so there are lots of different events that corkus emits like during the different life cycle of the the application you know startup shutdown pre-start all that kind of stuff and when you wanna anywhere in your application if you need to do something on one of those events you just create a method and tag it that says hey i want to observe that event so let's test that the app started and now this slick you know live reloading thing quote unquote like technically restarts quark is when i like hit a hit when i hit an endpoint and something major has changed right so if i do something that when you do something that it thinks it needs to restart so if you do nothing it doesn't need to do anything and so i added a non-startup observe so i think it thinks that i need to uh but maybe not uh let's see it would be up above the startup stuff yep there you go yep started pretty slick right so that watching the event reactive thing worked that's pretty cool and so at this point what i really want to do is create myself a table um i'm just going to execute we're gonna do a create table statement here that's gonna be a i wanna spell create right right yeah i like crate tables those tables all right let's refactor that that's great by the way i just want to point out uh rajagopal and uh prothmesh we do see your we do see your questions um i'm waiting for a point where we get to a good spot with the code that seven and eric are working um to kind of respond to some of those questions because they're a little bit longer form and i think we'll need a little bit of input from eric and seven as well right on that sounds great so let me get this startup table creation thingy and then we'll take a couple questions and then we'll move on to more endpoints we'll move on to actual endpoints um if i go to my cql console we're gonna go ahead go ahead and like use the nice autocomplete in cqlsh to craft that create table statement and so it knows that i have a to do key space and we're going to give the table what should we call it doo doo items what goes up with the traits we're going to call it did you stand this thing is going to have a list id which is an identifier for like the actual list of two news itself um that's gonna be that's gonna be a text and we're gonna have a um an id that's just the identifier for the item itself we're going to have a thing called completed which is going to be a boolean and that's going to be whether or not the to-do list item has been done or not and i'm going to have a thing called title that is text and again like so this is when we're going to get into some cassandra data modeling my table needs a primary key so for for folks that are you know coming from rdbms which i think is all of us at some point a primary key is the thing that we use for uniqueness in our in our database right so if i've got some keys in my primary key that's that's going to represent what's unique for a row and so i definitely need a list id and a regular i in the and the item id because i want separate rows for each now notice that in cassandra the the first thing in your primary key is the partition key which is the thing that we talked about for how you out how you determine what nodes own what data and so the list id is the first thing in my primary key and i can optionally throw that in parentheses uh so that i can do things like you know potentially use a secondary key here you know multiple keys to determine my partitioning uh okay so we're just going to keep this data model simple and it's just going to look something like this so i'm going to copy that over and throw it in our strand here all right and one thing i want to do is just we said we're going to use string format didn't we yeah it doesn't matter we're gonna add back though that if not exists otherwise you could run into problems thank you um if not exists so if you guys were if we were running like regular cassandra exists i might tell people not to do this thing that i'm doing here which is um you know dynamically generating ddl uh like on startup for the app especially if you if this is a you know multi-process distributed app you're gonna have lots of these coming up at the same time and because you're getting some gnarly uh you'd get into some gnarly uh race conditions and for ddl uh if you were doing this uh what do i want your percent f yep so um [Music] but in astro we do linearize ddl in astral serverless and so that gets you basically the ability you know that so then this isn't going to be a problem on the cloud uh if you were if you were doing this in you know your own cassandra that you're managing you should probably just maintain your state manually either you know with a dba or whatever so in this case we're going to pass a key space name and a table name as the two arguments to this um to this string.format command so this is going to be you said we said to do that to do right so we said something like that all right so we've got to create table statement so let me try to like make this a little bit more legible since we're falling off my screen all right and at least read it the spacing isn't pretty but we're live we don't have infinite time here so okay so there's a there's our create table statement and we will execute it on startup and once we do that we're gonna say i created my table lovely so um so now if i hit again like a random endpoint with the test one that we had from before hopefully clark is yeah aquarcus thought that i needed to start over and it did and then i should see table created which means that if i go back to my database up here in my web ui um i can select star from let's see if it exists to do and it's empty but it's but it's there so we've got ourselves a table and now we're ready to actually read from that table stub out some of the endpoints but maybe this is a good time for for those questions um david okay yeah so let's see so let me scroll up and find it here here we go so from uh reject um says uh let us i have this demo application deployed on two data uh two different data centers and each connect to its own database in this scenario how would load balancing work and also the mirroring now i had a follow-up question for him because i was like that sounds like multiple data centers in the same cluster from the cassandra level but i'm not sure if i was missing something that he was referring to from the actual quarkus application piece well that's an excellent question it's an excellent question and it sounds like it sounds like he was talking about data centers in the cassandra sense of the word but maybe both right like well if i pull up this picture um you know we've got three physical locations in this picture clarified uh he did clarify further on he's like if the app app is running more than one data center how would the load balancing be handled here you know in other words are we dependent on kubernetes here kubernetes is like it's only has its own challenges for deal with geo distribution yeah but but let's so let's take maybe kubernetes out of it and then maybe yeah focus on the first part um so yeah there's enough here so so you've got three regions like cassandra spanning with one cluster three data centers you know spanning these regions uh now similarly across the same geographic deployment you're gonna have an application here right in this case let's call it qarcus application and those and and that has potentially multiple instances of this app running in all three of these data centers as well right now each of those uh each of those applications probably is connected to the local data center because you want those geo local latencies right like no good reason to talk to europe from the us if you don't have to um so yeah i incur those hundred millies of you know every time you do a player get uh so so i think one of the questions was mirroring uh when you do when you do a write to the cassandra database in the u.s as long as you've got your replication set up properly that right will get replicated not only to the multiple replicas inside the us here but also to multiple replicas in your other data centers across the globe the database takes care of that uh automatically and so you know if you did that right and then a little bit later you did a read from from the app tier that's sitting on top of um your your data center in europe you would still be able to you know pull that all that data those latencies are the latency to actually get things replicated or very fast i mean this is something that like folks have been doing for years and years i mean there was like uh i think there was a blog post like this must be like a six seven year old blog post by now that netflix did where they write a million things in you know usc and they read it immediately from us west and it's all there right yeah um yeah so this is something that people do with cassandra basically all the time um so that's pretty standard uh around the mirroring the thing that's a little bit i guess trickier is like what happens with the load balancing right so um you need you need to have like a way of routing the request from your users in the us to the applications here in the us right and the users in europe to the applications here in europe and that's like routing that you know is going to be potentially specific to your own architecture right and some folks use kind of global load balancers uh there is some like interesting technology out there like that that the cloud providers provide around this there's also some third-party tools around uh you know global load balancers based on geography that will take uh you know requests coming from the internet you know from from from different regions around the world and determine you know where to route them to your back end uh your backend apps so um so hopefully that answers the question um if we wanted to get the kubernetes part of that into this like kubernetes isn't really super mature in terms of running in multiple regions um there is kubernetes like like multi-region i think it's called yeah like some sort of federation coming like being worked on i would say uh but but currently what people do is they just run separate clusters separate kubernetes clusters across the regions right and actually that's what that's what we do in astro when we have uh you know multiple uh you know region deployments there's multiple uh kubernetes clusters that are running and then we just have to figure out networking between the two so hopefully that's an important distinction is that if you're using astra where you know it's built on kubernetes and and you don't need to deal with that right you're not like we've dealt with it for you yeah that's right yeah absolutely so like for example there was a tweet like so we tweeted when when an astro server list uh came out i think i forget who it was maybe like uh so jimmy calmer vp of engineering had a nice blog post and somebody tweeted that and uh i think it was kelsey hightower you guys probably know who he is from you know kubernetes fame that guy's awesome uh you know he tweeted hey like how is this serverless if it's all built on kubernetes right like what's going on uh well like the service itself is like a serverless service like if you're a user you just saw me do a couple clicks in our ui and get a database and and and an endpoint that you can use in a serverless fashion you get build per operation that sort of thing uh now the service itself that where the data stacks is running that thing is built on kubernetes um and so it's kind of a cloud native you know kubernetes powered yeah you know supercharged cassandra um and so it's under the hood sorry i think it speaks to the fact that like serverless on the function side is an arbitrary code execution platform right like that's a that's a container for code whereas a a a data service like a data api a public data api like we're offering that is not an arbitrary code execution platform that's kind of like pipe in get out right the fact that it's serverless underneath the covers is is just what gives us a more efficient you know implementation and billing model uh for use and and right i mean there's a big difference server is not as in function as a service but as in but as in build more own less exactly okay so oh go ahead sorry sorry go ahead i was gonna ask if there were other questions yes okay good so so then uh prathamesh had asked how um how does corka cql session handle load do default configuration uh sufficient to connect multiple nodes of cassandra or any specific configuration required where to change config if required i could handle that for a number or normal cql session i just don't know about the quarkus one is it essentially the same sorry you're saying if there's configuration changes uh for for the cassandra driver well yeah i think what profit measures what i interpreted from that question was really is there any difference between the corka cql session and regular cql session and how the driver is handling load load balancing anything like that no it's the same thing okay this is the same thing it's just like we're just doing the boilerplate of establishing that connection and standing up that cluster object and it's and it uses the native carcass config which is just the thing you put in application.properties but you know aside from that you're just you're literally using the that's a hundred driver i actually just realized i didn't finish the kelsey hightower story so somebody on on twitter somebody on twitter explained oh yeah like the service of serverless but you know the way that they run it themselves is kubernetes and he's like oh that's dope and so i think uh everybody at datastax got really excited that chelsea said that ourselves yeah that's right right so that was super awesome so i have one another here um i was having a conversation with somebody uh in discord uh with nixa uh nick zack uh and we were talking about astra right and and he asks so does astr act as a load balance or two so here's just something um i i just got to kind of point out cassandra itself right by its distributed nature it's peer-to-peer and leaderless nature and the way that it handles requests is already load balancing for you right um you know seb talked about a little bit earlier but the fact that you have multiple replicas that have data that lends itself naturally to be able to have multiple replicas that can service requests for any particular data you know instead of just one node over and over and that is stuff that is managed via the driver via cassandra itself um so astra does that naturally just because it is based on its build on cassandra right so so that all that part is actually being done from a load balancing perspective that's being done underneath the hood is just part of how cassandra works yeah so strictly load balancing the driver does it uh and then like if you're talking about like inside of cassandra like routing stuff we just call that coordinating but i guess you could say that it's like you know yeah so so like rounding like routing the operations inside of the cassandra cluster is what we call coordinating if you talk to a cassandra person and they say coordinating that's what that means but yeah so there is load balancing at the driver so the driver's basically aware of all the nodes in the cluster it's actually got established it's actually established connections to all the nodes in the cluster yeah um it kind of knows who owns what and it's like smart enough to uh spread out the load and route things intelligently uh based on your config right so like it knows what data center to hit um and things like that okay so let's come back to coding i think we were so we were at the we're at a good spot where we can actually go back to that little app that we had and we had this request that failed and it was a get request against this endpoint uh giving us a 404 so we're hypothesizing at this point right because we're kind of reverse engineering this app like if you're doing a get against api 2 slash id it sounds like you're trying to just read the contents of the table that we created right like basically get the list of ids the list of to-do's for this to-do list so we're gonna go ahead and try to implement that um let's see so i'll build myself a fresh endpoint which is going to say publix string get to do's and um it's going to have a path and that path is going to be [Music] so api is already in there slash you do slash what should we call this list id maybe yeah i think so list id so that's a path parameter and so i can say at pathpram just our regular um java xrs list id and so this is going to be a string called list i id call it id i guess like this but it doesn't matter um and yeah um and then we're gonna again grab our session and we're going to do execute and we're going to grab a uh insert i don't know how to tell skype did not do that but it's fine and sorry select statement select our two do's and i'll go ahead and create my constant up top like we did before box and field and this is just going to be a select star from and table now i do have to create these in order all right right on so that's a select statement um actually i think we said i don't think this needs to return anything make it return void and you gotta return stuff it's expecting to get the to do's right you gotta return something oh you're right i do need to return someone so let's return it let's return this ring for now because we don't know what the heck it actually wants um but but yeah you're right like it's probably it probably needs the whole thing right it probably needs a it probably needs a json representation of the to-do list yeah a bunch of items or something that it's going to return yeah that makes sense but for now i'm going to get the same i'm just going to return the first row in our payload just to test stuff out you need a few annotations there too definitely but we need to say it's blocking we need to say that it's producing some let's say application json at this point and we need to know that it's consuming no it's not consuming anything oh it's not consuming anything that's right it's a get though get all right well and i had a could go on for hours talking about rest semantics but that's outside the scope of this right that's right that's right yeah um yeah eric was saying he didn't like how the how the app was set up on the front end and i didn't uh let's see if this thing even works um i refresh my page and hopefully it's going to try to hit an endpoint it did it didn't get a 400 to get a 500 which means sub screwed up 400 means ui screwed up 500 means yeah you got no point on the back end no there's no no entries there is no entry of course because we have an empty table so if let's just do a simple so this is where we got into like should we do this with optionals right we can if we want to um so it's just a time check we're under 15 minutes yep let's let's keep this rolling so i'm just going to do a quick null check rs no it does not equal no well turn nothing keep this moving um this is not equal so no 500. hopefully lovely all right so yeah it did uh it went out and it tried to get some to do's and it got a nothing payload um really we should like bless this out but in order for us to go like figure out the poju and what things look like when we read them i kind of want to just like insert something first um because we're being hacky so i'm going to put in the eric vacation to do i need a vacation so bad i'm taking a vacation i'm off i'm off starting tomorrow folks so am i so that means you guys have this whole thing you stir up a whole bunch of questions and then you take off all right so if you guys have questions next week just uh just hit eric on twitter boy all right so so yeah there's a request it tried to do a post which is creating a to-do item um and here's the path that it used uh awesome and then you can see that there is a payload associated and that payload is just a json representation of a new list item that's got a completed an id and a title so i think it's time for us to make that pojo let's thumb out our create to do item um this is also going to take a path for ram did it yeah it did but it also took consumes media type application json i do need to import that this is going to be a post ah it's going to be blocking and it's going to have a path which is actually the same path as the last one right to do and also list id but now differently we're also going to take a to-do item called item all right and for this let's create a create an inner class we're going to keep everything in one file for this but we said this probably wants to be public static um so if you want to set up id debugging maybe this would be fun i'm going to do that right here show folks how to add a configuration so one cool thing about quark is again like this is all running in my terminal but you can see when it comes up it makes reference to port 5050 for you know remote debugging it's automatically configured that way and so that makes it so that i can do kind of the dumbest and simplest um remote debugging configuration in java if i type in remote gosh where's like the simple remote one here that's it this is all i need i apply i run it and then you can see that i've connected to the target vm on 5005 so if i go and try to get vacation hopefully see if i'm not missing something we should actually get the yeah we should actually get this to stop but i do wrong i got a 500 error all right so you've got four minutes to make it work no pressure no pressure oh jeez this is thinking longer than i thought it was going to take oh guys we got to give away swag you've got all these folks who have stayed with us and scared them or whatnot well maybe what we do is we take a swag break and i'll keep figuring this out we could do that and that's a great idea i think i think at this point everybody who's been with us so far they they deserve their swag they totally deserve their swag all right so with that now it doesn't mean you can just leave we got to watch uh more tears with seb but um all right so these are not happy tears yeah yeah so the first thing first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to drop now this is time based right so this is for the red hat swag first 100 people who want it are going to get it everybody else sorry you're not going to so um so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to put red i'm going to try to make this as fast or fair as i can it's actually cork of swag there's some actually pretty good stuff in there do you guys oh my bad it's quirk of swag it was red headlining okay swag but it's only the first hundred people all right so i'm gonna i'm gonna hit it in both discord at the same time so blue and blue there's the red hat swag go to that form you got to fill that out to get yourself some of that and you get to pick the swag too that's one when we give swag we just give you the swag we give you you actually get to pick the swag here so we'll let everybody do that for a moment while seb collects his tears hey things are working all right oh us address only oh okay well here i got it i got a different thing for you yeah unfortunately we can only do ship shipments can we drop ship to u.s address i see i see sorry for our non-us folks i didn't realize that part that's okay i'm gonna have another giveaway for you yeah sorry about that okay so i'm now gonna drop you know you could argue that this next one will be awesome as well now this one's not time-based um but this the form i just dropped you'll see that thanks for oh hello there from poland hi um you'll see that the link that i just dropped uh your giveaway so that form will allow you to get either your voucher for two attempts for your cassandra certification so there's a couple different certifications actually you can choose uh to use it for any of them um and you can get two free attempts those are 145 bucks a piece so it also helps in the case maybe you don't pass the first time well guess what you have a free attempt the other option is to just get uh 300 in astro credits now given that the 25 credit that we give you just by default every month that rolls every month is enough to actually run small production workloads 300 bucks actually gets you pretty far right um if you if you start really using it past that 25 so so you choose right and the instructions on how to get either are there with the case of 300 credit you just have to give the dbid of one of your astra databases but go ahead and fill those out so you can get some stuff and that's a thank you to all of you for coming us coming and being with us today i think seb you said you got you made some progress in that uh couple of minutes there yeah yeah we're doing well all right we're ripping here so i can catch you guys up um i started creating my pojo here and i created a uh insert item a query so let's populate my pojo the pojo is going to have to have a let's call this private string id it's going to have a list id idr actually doesn't have to have a list id it has a completed title and a boolean completed um and then i can get idea to generate some stuff for me i'd like some gutters and setters please i would also like two constructors the hard way yeah we did we did we said hey you don't need the no argument constructor but then you do need the nor do you make a structure for serialization serialization deserialization because that's what jackson wants well it's only because it's a nest an inner class if it wasn't an inner class i don't think it would need it yeah so we'll make jackson happy for the inner class um right on um yeah some of these gotcha this is why we this is why we try stuff before the day of right throw this thing up on top just for aesthetics and so at this point i've got a pojo i'm going back to my creativity thingy and there we go um we're gonna grab the what order is this in id title completed uh well okay first i have the list id oh sorry i made the order from the insert statement which is id text and completed so we're going to grab item.id these are positional items there is a way to do this by name by the way but um text and item it's going to be it's not ideas we get id these are private get um title we said this is the texas title and then completed get completed why is it that here is completed because it's a boolean lovely all right so this should actually create the item and in theory i should actually return i thought we said that this was void it didn't return anything big avoid which is why i said it should be a put not a post but right now we're getting into semantics we had that whole argument about proper restfulness yep um i tend to fall on the purest side of the rest spectrum oh the other thing that i had going is by the way folks like i did get my debugger to stop here and you can see that i had an item now the item had nothing in it because i hadn't instantiated it yet but if i let this thing rip and run it again and try to insert something let's see where's my breakpoint i may have gotten rid of the breakpoint but anyway let's see what it did so 500 for what for the post said that something stupid let's see what am i missing i can't write er sql queries insert into oh i forgot to train our format all right key space name table name try that again so this worked it's the post and i got a error now on my get so yeah we did a post let's see if that actually shows up on the database there you go we got data in the database we have written we've written to cassandra with one minute to spare folks that's good we can keep going but i think uh let's see i'll keep working on this but i don't know if you if i'm gonna get cut off or not what's the deal david yeah yeah we we do need to probably do it pretty soon i'm not gonna i'm not no hooks [Laughter] [Laughter] no i don't see any tomatoes if anyone wants to throw a tomato go for it but yeah we we should we should uh tailor it up here real quick yeah okay so the here we go the returning shepherd's pole chrome extension that's right yeah yeah yeah it's fun all right so this is as far as we got i believe folks um yeah hey seb do you want to touch on real quick someone in the chat is saying why do i have to write old school insert and select queries and just comparing it to like spread data why why would i use corpus if i have to do that oh you don't you don't so yeah you can you can you can work with the driver however way you want to work with the driver so the driver supports like squares and obviously like this is a pain point because i'm making mistakes typing them out you can use the object never the object mapper is what gets you away from having to write you know insert statements like uh like we're in 1995. by the way jyn just threw a couple tomatoes and a kiwi at you thank you jim yeah you can totally use the mapper and all that there's there's no limitation there i don't know about you said but i find it especially when um uh i'm doing things where we're not talking about the mapper explicitly um i will write out like you are uh in workshops just like this so everybody can follow along and it's really easy to understand what's going on kind of deal but yeah you're not you're not limited it's not a quirks thing and you're not limited anyway yeah i just dropped the link to the mapper docs but yeah that's a good point because then it's like oh auto mapping magic like wait what happened there you know yeah this way it's really exactly exactly yeah i think you're like everybody definitely everybody understands what an insert statement is and so sometimes when we take it back to that for for the live demo like points get across um real quick um before we wrap up here yeah apple is saying oh go ahead peter sorry you um we do have the requesting recording posted to the data stacks developers channel that's right on youtube um but uh yeah you have to give us some apple pie if you want the reporting all right folks uh let me drop that url for data sex devs channel um on youtube and uh folks we do these uh workshops pretty frequently so um if you wanted to hit hit that magic little subscribe button uh you'll get notifications about uh other workshop recordings uh that the developer relations team here does uh at datasacks the channel is uh that i just dropped the url to the channel in the chat are you curious the answers are here so yeah yeah and the repo we could drop the repo one more time just for those who are interested if you go to the main branch um there you go boo and i do this um if you uh take a look at that in the main branch it's all there right you can just go ahead and build it then you can go back to the puzzle branch and try to puzzle it out like you saw subdue all right well with that try again there should be no limitation there so thank you everybody for joining us today uh thank you eric thank you seb thank you peter every time i say that i feel like we're doing the romper room and if anyone gets that reference then reach out to me let me know but uh again thank you everybody for joining us on this workshop and we'll see you again next time take care here friends",
