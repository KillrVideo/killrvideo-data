    "text": "hello and welcome to the kate sander introduction to start out what is kate sandra well kate sander is a production-ready cloud-native apache cassandra distribution running on kubernetes that's multi-cluster aware but really what does that all mean so at its core we take kubernetes this is where we deploy our resources pods physical persistent volumes what have you on top of that we have apache cassandra which is a distributed highly available database that is designed to run across multiple data centers all over the world and it's been used successfully at places like netflix and apple to scale to petabytes of information from there we layer in stargate which is a collection of apis that use cassandra as a backend so you can use this to speak rest graphql or even document formats for your application and store that information inside of apache cassandra next we use prometheus to expose metrics for all the components within our stack and then finally we have reaper medusa which are cassandra specific they provide backup and restore as well as repair services so let's see how it works in our architecture we're going to talk about a control plane cluster this control plane cluster is where we talk with cube cuddle and describe the kate sander clusters that we want to deploy now the control plane cluster is actually deploying onto separate data plane clusters it could deploy to itself but in this architecture we're going to separate our data plane from our control plane you'll note that each of these data planes are running inside of separate regions we're using the gcp region names here so we have our control plane and europe north 1 and then our data planes in europe west 2 and europe west 3. from here we're going to spin up the control plane so we're just going to use helm to do this installation we're going to specify our chart name the release name and what have you this creates the namespace installs our operator and finally it configures some certificates of web hooks it's worth noting that we have a dependency on cert manager here it just makes all the tls bits a lot easier next we configure the data planes so for each data plane we're going to run this helm install command and it's going to create the namespace install the operator configure the certificates and web hooks and finally generate some access credentials and it knows to do this because we're setting the control plane equals to false so we're saying hey kate center operator in this environment you are going to be receiving your cait standard clusters from somewhere else and it's your job to realize part of that kit sander cluster inside of your your your local cluster infrastructure we need to configure access for the control plane to reach out and talk to the data planes so those client credentials that were these access credentials that were created in the previous step we're going to retrieve those credentials generate a cube config and store it in the control plane as a secret and create something called a client config that maps those cube config secrets into uh actual client kubernetes clients that we will then uh utilize from the control plane server and with that done we now have secure connectivity between the operator running in the control plane and the kubernetes api servers running within the data planes so let's take a look at what it takes to create a sander cluster we're going to create a custom resource called a kate sander cluster where we specify the version the cassandra data centers which in our language are our data plane clusters any configuration overrides and then finally we just deploy this let's see what this looks like so from our workstation we're going to do a cube cuddle apply and push that kate sander cluster object to our control plane cluster our control pin cluster is going to say hey i need to start bootstrapping the skate standard cluster so it's going to start with the data center in data plane 0. it will start create the object inside of the data plane 0 kubernetes api the local operator will then start bootstrapping actual pods persistent volumes what have you and reporting that status back up to the control plane when it's done the control plane will then bootstrap the second data center in this case data plane one monitor the status wait for it to be complete and during this time you don't have to switch context to talk to these these data plane clusters you just communicate with the control plane cluster to get the status of your deployment if there are any errors but ultimately when it's all said and done you have a multi-region multi-data center multi-kubernetes cluster apache cassandra cluster that's highly available and fault tolerant at the regional level which is pretty amazing so with all that being said try it out and helm install kate sandra you can visit us at kate sander dot io go to kate sandra on twitter or github.com kate sandra thanks so much",
