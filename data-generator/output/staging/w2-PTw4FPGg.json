    "text": "hello everyone welcome to data Stacks Academy I am Luke Tillman technical evangelist for data Stacks joining you from Sunny Denver Colorado and I am happy to be joined in the studio by two of my colleagues David gilardi and Jeff Carpenter hello gentlemen hello hello so in a previous uh video we kind of talked a little bit and uh and I did a lot of talking so it's kind of cool to be able to turn the tables on the two of you now but we kind of talked a little bit about the past and and where killer video uh you know where it came from and and some of the history so now I'm really interested to kind of get your perspective now that we've handed the project off um you know to the two of you and you're going to be kind of moving the project forward um you know what what kind of what kind of direction we're going to take it and and you know kind of some of the ideas that you guys have but the first question that I have uh for the two of you is now that you've had some time to kind of dig in to killer video and you know uh David I know you you worked on a Java implementation something that we didn't have uh for a really long time and really wanted I'm kind of just curious you know what what what are your impressions um you know what's it like working with killer video now that the two of you are kind of in charge of moving things forward yeah so I'll take a first crack um so there from my perspective there's there's actually two levels to this right um the first part of it is the first time that I got introduced to killer video this is before I had any knowledge of things like you know uh Etsy d uh grpc any of the microservices implementation I had never worked with the DSC driver in any of the languages before anything totally new at a lot of the technology that was in killer video so my first experience with it really was as a regular developer just walking in looking at the documentation that you had the explanations and everything trying to learn how the microservices work downloading it getting it running in my ID all that right um and from that standpoint and looking at that from the the developer standpoint of someone who's just trying to get this thing up and running because I want to get into some DSE driver code I want to see how this stuff works it was actually surprisingly easy right uh you know to be able to stand it up get everything going uh you know between the download and reading the instructions you know I had a working a working version locally in my laptop within a couple hours right and from that standpoint it allowed me to kind of see how uh see how everything interacted and that kind of deal now going to the next level of that as an actual evangelist and someone who's developing against the multiple language platforms now I need to understand how do the microservices work where is the front end coming from how do I register my services and all that kind of stuff there is a big learning curve honestly um now that wasn't a bad learning curve it was just a big learning curve and a lot of that was because I just didn't have the immediate familiar familiarity that's an easy word for me to say with all of the uh all the various various pieces and everything so now that I've gotten a chance to really dig into all those all the components and everything um it's been very enlightening especially looking at comparing and coding against the c-sharp node.js and the Java versions right and being able to see them uh some of some of the common denominators across the drivers um how matter of fact this is kind of a plug back to you Luke um with the microservices choices that you made with grpc and everything saying how seamless that really made I mean you mentioned before in the previous talk that part of the reason why you chose some of the directions you did was because in a real real organization like where we came from it's a very true thing that you might be Java one day you might be c-sharp the next you might be a combination of those things right and to implement it in such a way that makes that seamless and that is my experience I haven't had to touch which is so cool like the microservices have all worked seamless regardless of what version I'm in it's it's really slick the web UI all that kind of stuff um so yeah so definitely the the learning curve was a big part of that um you know and now that I've gotten past that point I'm able to fly pretty quickly with the different versions um asynchronous programming was a real fun part of that as well I was somewhat new to the the asynchronous world and seeing how that it's implemented differently again across the different language versions and and really having to tie that stuff together in the Java Java piece was uh definitely some some work there um yeah so I think one thing yeah no go ahead oh I was just gonna say that I mean that was a definitely a part of the learning curve for me too is uh coming in and learning the asynchronous programming style and I actually remember asking at one point like seems like the dominant Paradigm in in our Java implementation is kind of the the asynchronous uh you know doing all these things with listenable Futures and I'm not used to programming like this can't we have a simpler example that just does synchronous get my results set iterate through it send the results back and I remember Patrick saying to me like well you know Jeff this is a real world application this is how real world applications are done you know this is not example code uh my first Cassandra program example I mean this is definitely like real live application so for me coming in uh you know I've been working for the past few years as an architect so you know typically I would be on the other end of some of these decisions about what technologies we're going to use and how we're going to use them in setting up the programming standards and the coding standards and so great uh change of pace for me coming in walking into someone else's code base where all these technology decisions and conventions have already been put in place and uh getting to feel again what it feels like to be on the receiving end of of some of someone else's technical decisions and so and walking in and having my own opinions about why are we using grpc or wouldn't it be better if we were using rest apis for all these services uh so it's really that really that good dose of humility to come in and and look at the technology choices that have been made by another person and they're equally valid in many if not all cases to the choices that you might have made coming in like with your own personal preference and this is the way that I've always done things it's a great eye-opener to come and see how someone else has done something and you know to take that as a learning experience and I think you and I both David have a little bit of that uh polyglot type exposure to to multiple languages and multiple implementations now that's um I mean that's really essential for your breadth and maturity as a developer if you're just going to say okay I'm I I only do Java well especially in today's day and age I could get in a whole talk on that you know absolutely yeah did it give you a did it give you a little bit of an appreciation on how how the various programming languages do asynchronous code like it's very different oh yeah you know some some are similar but you know uh you know I probably get in trouble for this and I'm sure there's gonna be someone here who can counter me but but let me you know I'm a I've been coding my core languages Java I code a bunch of different languages in half her years but the core one that I've really focused on is Java and I will say um but the C sharp and node.js implementations of asynchrist programming um kind of knock Java out of the park they were so much easier to work with the Java the Java piece with completable Futures and everything while it is pretty full-fledged API I mean you can do all sorts of stuff with it it just at least in my opinion and in my Noob asynchronous knowledge I'll say it was a lot harder to get moving with that compared to uh the the C sharp and node.js implementations without a doubt yeah and Jeff to your point about about architecture you know it's funny uh being a being a team of one right so I was a I was a sort of an architecture and and developing development team of of one you know with Patrick to bounce some ideas off of but one of the cool things about having you guys here now and kind of taking uh you know kind of taking over the project is you know we're a much bigger team um you know you could going forward as you're kind of making these architecture decisions you know maybe have a have a lot more people to kind of Bounce these ideas off of and uh you know we can all bring our own our own preconceived notions of how how it should be and hash it out maybe a little bit more like it is in the real world yeah true yeah yeah very true so I'm curious guys what are you like you know now that you're taking it over what's you know what's next for the project what um you know it is what it is right now but what are we gonna do you know what are the new features what are what are some of the goals for the future of killer video yeah so one of the things that's really great about this as an application domain is that there are more and more features that you know that you could add um we're not it's you might say that it's similar to YouTube but there's a lot of things that are slightly different directions that we're able to take things in a in that different direction to really show off the features of our our products that we have at data Stacks so uh you know one of the things that we observe right away in looking at the application is that it does a lot with just the core uh Cassandra but then there were a lot of features that had been added even to the open source Apache Cassandra project that had not really been taken advantage of yet like I don't think that there were any user-defined types I don't know that there were any uh index there's not really that many indexes there was no materialized view and usage there was just a number of things where we we thought okay there are definitely uh elements of the technology that we want to show off and not in a way where we're just trying to force fit something in or use something for the sake of using it but if you look at this domain of a video sharing application there are a legitimate number of places where we need more advanced search capability we need more complex data structures in order to represent things so you know not only are we looking to add more of those core Cassandras you know things that have been added to the cql language but also incorporating more of data Stacks Enterprise as a as a product line because there is a legitimate value add on top of the the core Cassandra that DSE brings so we have uh well you know there's an interesting Quirk right now that uh the search capabilities of killer video are we we for the most part have parity across the different language implementations but there are cases where um there's a search capability that's uh implemented using DSE search in one area and then it's just a straight um table query on Cassandra in another area so we're trying to bring those things into parity together and then another area that we're super excited about is incorporating graph so it's my next project DSE graph implementation in order to bring a recommendation engine kind of capability into killer video so if you liked these videos you might also like these videos there's something like that there right now but it's really just based on text tags and not any sort of you know AI machine learning all this sort of gravy that we're starting to bring in doing those those kinds of things based off of the core graph implementation and bringing that in I think that's really going to take it to the next level in terms of a capability as an application so I don't know what did you think David I agree with everything you just said no I mean yeah so it really is yeah yeah of course I I like that answer right uh no it is is just said really just adding to it I mean we're definitely pushing into the DSC 5.1 kind of Realm um to to really start to kind of exercise some of the new features that have become available in the drivers and everything so we can not only provide you know that out to developers so we give them a starting place right so not only do they have the API docs and things like that but here these are real working examples in a real actual application check this out and and you kind of you touch on this as well I mean we're we're definitely when we Implement these features we are we're purposely looking to make them relevant they're not contrived you know they're they're trying you know they're real world examples of okay I have a real app here this really needs to do this this thing over here well how would I how would I what's the real best way to implement that and the cool thing too is you know we get to enter we get to interface with the internal data Stacks teams and and find out you know are there are there best use cases are there you know ways that we can really kind of exercise some of this stuff so yeah definitely pushing into some of the new features yeah and that we're gonna make a video another video in upcoming series talking about um a hackathon that we did that involved a lot of the internal development teams and some of the cool stuff that they came up with that was even Beyond things that we had on our roadmap for where we wanted to take killer videos so they you know that is an incredibly creative team that has a lot of great ideas that that we're able to draw from so yeah yeah I think it's really just a testament you know to three years ago when killer video started um to now and some of the ideas that you guys have just how far datastak's Enterprise as a product has come you have all these kind of cool new things to play with like graph is a great example and then you know I know David um you've been dabbling a little bit with actually getting this thing live and you know kind of speaking of new things from data Stacks you know actually running this on the data Stacks manage Cloud can you talk a little bit about you know what that's been like and kind of maybe plans there yeah absolutely so yeah that's that is in process right now um we are actually we're technically running on DMC the days that's manager Cloud right now I just I haven't tell you the URL yeah it's not public yet but it is but no I mean the whole point of this is this is like an eat our own dog food mentality I'm sure you've heard that phrase before um so we we have our own actual real production implementation on our own cloud with our class faster and so on and so forth so that whole experience you know um there's really kind of a couple different aspects there's the application aspect there's the part of standing up those very microservices and stuff that you built into the docker container and actually putting them out there in a real world app um or real world infrastructure and everything and then there is the the DMC aspect with cluster and having the manage the cluster so it's actually been really neat because we approach this as working with the DMC team like we are an outside client that we are not data Stacks doing this that we're an actual client who has gone to them we're paying them we're going through all of the motions and everything so it's been really neat uh you know from the perspective of coming in that way and exercising them if you will and making them deal with us you know I tried to come up with um as realistic and slightly absurd project plan as I could um to just kind of mirror what we see in the real world oh we all know that doesn't really happen in the real world people don't have ridiculous never ever yeah exactly no so it's been great it's been awesome because again um getting this up on real you know real infrastructure and everything and again eating our own dog food as far as the DMC part uh goes I think that's really kind of important you know um so so what's what the neat thing about that too is that now is going to that is informing some of the next steps that we're going into with the app itself um especially from the application and um I actually decided uh for now I I was debating whether or not I was going to go full micro service right because you have all these microservices you built into it do I want to go full micro microservice and actually Implement every one of those on their own um uh service up on AWS or do I want to keep the docker containers or whatever I totally cheated and stuck with Ducker for now um but that's you know it's all running and what's Awesome by the way going back to what we talked about before um with having like things like grpc and being seamless across the languages I can run all of the languages up on my instances it doesn't matter I can actually interchangeably switch between them no big deal right that to me is I'm sorry I just keep using the word awesome it's awesome it's totally awesome because again from our perspective in having to keep these language versions in parity and and keep them all relevant and things like that it makes our job a lot easier and gives a great example as you mentioned earlier in the previous video Luke about again if you have an organization that has multiple languages how do you go about what would be one way you can go about developing your applications right and that would support that and so anyway yeah all together it's been it's it's been a very fun and uh knowledge attaining experience yeah we should totally do that David we so you what you have deployed right now is all Java microservices is that right yeah yeah it's it's let's see all the web UI front end is node.js the service the other I think you did Luke you did all that node right it's all node yep yeah the web server is all node okay so all all of that part is a node but the service implementation that I'm doing I either do in Java or I can do in node.js or I can do in c-sharp um so it it so in any given time yeah it just depends on which one I want to Launch cool yeah so guys I want to kind of close um with you know if there's anyone out there watching this and they might be interested maybe in helping out or they might want to contribute something to killer video you know is there anything you would suggest to any things on the wish list or or how would somebody go about kind of contributing to killer video or what are some things that maybe you'd be looking for from someone out there hoping to help yeah this is an area that I think we're trying to move toward is opening up our roadmap a little bit so we're working on getting you know our internal Google Docs that have lists of things that we want to add to get getting that incorporated as actual issues into the GitHub project the killer video GitHub project so that is a transition that's in place and then you know coming out of that I think there's going to be everything from um little little tasks here and there to clean things up to Major things like writing a python implementation you know as we look across you know we have our own internal data about which drivers are most popular and Which languages are you know are the most frequently used in terms of our our client drivers and you know we're we're getting a lot of feedback that you know it really would be a good idea to have a python implementation that turns out to be pretty popular so yeah so if someone wants to write that up go ahead foreign implementation they've been trying forever thank you for your time this has been super interesting and uh hopefully we'll do it again sometime soon yeah all right thank you thank you",
