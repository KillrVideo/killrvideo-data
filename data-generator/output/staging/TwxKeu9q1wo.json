Find out in this 5 min demo of an Ethereum fraud tracking example:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8pXVof9BfE\n\n.. or read on!  Some data needs more expressive data modeling in order to derive insights from it.  Graph databases enable richer data modeling with a simpler syntax over relational databases.  Quine has it’s roots in DARPA research and is the first in-memory streaming graph that supports real-time, event-driven workflows.  It enables high volume, low signal complex event processing like:\n* Fraud detection\n* Real-time recommendation engines\n* Master data management (MDM)\n* Network and IT operations\n* Identity and access management (IAM)\nQuine is a streaming graph capable of building real-time graph insights on streaming data as-is-happens, as well as for the data to be streamed-out for event processing.   The graph data is stored on disk through a configured persistent store with out-of-the-box support for Cassandra or Astra DB. When using Cassandra/Astra, Quine instances can achieve extremely high throughput, high availability, data replication, and failover strategies needed for production operation in the enterprise.\n\nCONNECT WITH DATASTAX \nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/datastaxdevs?sub_confirmation=1 \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/datastaxdevs\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/datastaxdevs\n\nCONNECT WITH QUINE.IO\nQuine on Github: https://github.com/thatdot/quine\nQuine Slack: https://quine-io.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-18zgkbizn-xLHGyB4Edi_C12wyHBhwew#/shared-invite/email\n\nAbout DataStax:\nDataStax is the company behind the massively scalable, highly available, cloud-native NoSQL data platform built on Apache Cassandra™.

    "text": "foreign hi there we're going to spend the next couple minutes talking about how and why to integrate asterdb which is built in Apache Cassandra to Quine what's Quine you might ask well it's the world's first streaming graph graph data solves an important problem where some data needs more expressive data modeling in order to actually derive insights from it graph databases focused on the relationships between data and graph databases initial enabled as richer data modeling with a somewhat even simpler syntax than relational databases quite has its roots in DARPA research it's really this first in-memory streaming graph that supports real-time event-driven workflows this enables high volume low signal complex event processing use cases like fraud detection real-time recommendation engines and master data management Network it Ops that sort of thing so quine's a streaming graph capable of building these real-time graph insights on a streaming data as it happens as well as for that data to be streamed out over event processing the graph data is stored on disk configured through a persistent store that out of the box supports Apache Cassandra or asterdb when using Cassandra and Astera Quine instances can achieve extremely high throughput high availability and replicate data across regions and even multi-region and have failover strategies needed for this sort of production operation that you're looking for in the Enterprise great so let's check out now how we can integrate Quine to Astra itself on awesome Astra which is hosted on GitHub we've got a collection of guides to integrate astridbu third-party Technologies this one's pretty straightforward um this is designed for Quine version one two one I do believe there are later versions of Quine as well but that's what this one was written for with Java 11. um so just by doing a quick Java command here we can very verify that yep we are in fact running Java 11. you can go download that from from Oracle or elsewhere if you need it that's a free download creating an astro account database and token let's walk you through that right now it's very simple you can sign in with your email uh GitHub or Google I sign in with Google so that just takes a couple clicks and that brings me to the 80 gigabyte free monthly plan uh which you know and no credit cards required here you will not exceed the the free plan limits um in doing any of this work so not to worry um and then you can just click right here to create a database which is very simple uh and it Shields you from all the low level infrastructure decisions so you know you're not sitting here picking like i7s or you know what instance type what virtual Hardware you want to throw at something you just create your database name and your key space name um the tutorial does sort of expect this name but you can you know change it to be whatever you want now I'm going to deploy to Google's Oregon Data Center here and click create database uh and then Astra handles all the low-level infrastructure details for you um and in just a you know a couple minutes uh goes ahead and creates the the database for you now I'm going to copy um this off um to a separate file here um so that I have my token and uh that's a uh that's an important one you also want to download this because it's the only time your your token is presented to you I'm going to invalidate these at the end of the demo of course um so that they're you know no longer used for this database as they are specific to this database uh so great yeah so um saving those off is important um because you'll need them in the Quant configuration file and then uh as soon as the database is created uh we just click go to database here awesome the database is now active and of course this token just gives you default permissions uh you can of course change those um but we're just to get the demo up and running you don't need to do much other than to accept the defaults so we can click go to the database and that'll bring us to our dashboard um and then what you want to do is uh let's see let's say show all databases there's my Quine database great uh you can see it's Health using the embedded graphan on Prometheus metrics um here and then in the connect tab um you can go get the download the the secure connect bundle which basically is a ZIP file and helps your driver connections um get all the Telemetry of sort of you know where is your particular Cloud instance you know and database hosted um so here uh you can use apis to connect but in this case we're going to just use the Java Java driver and I'll say download secure connect bundle that'll drop this secure connect bundle zip right here and I'm going to drop that in the same directory that I downloaded my Quine jar file to and replace it so that is now right here now um I also um in my Sublime Text here I've got uh um my quine.conf file uh that's the next step here in the Quan guide and most of these values are are fairly boilerplate um you'll notice I used uh the same key space name as the one I created that's important there's some consistency settings I'm telling it what data center to use the the secure connect bundle tells it what you know platform and and cloud provider um and then I'm going to grab that uh token that I downloaded and actually cut and pasted and both downloaded um and I can put that right here and overwrite my old one this is the the token ID and then um that uh secure connect bundle zip um I just make sure I've I've elaborated the path to that full path to that um which I have and then I can save my coin conf file and I'm good to go um so now I've basically done all of these steps um you know download the secure connect bundle I have my token I've created my database so I can kind of Breeze through these instructions you know these these show you the step by step on how to do things um you know uh we already edited the Quine connect file and as you saw there's a couple Cassandra specific settings in there you know these are no different uh than they are with regular open source Cassandra in terms of um you know setting right consistency reconsistancy replication factor that sort of stuff um great and now all you need to do is is run coin now as of this writing um there's a bug here sometimes that um the Quan snapshots table doesn't get created um so if you do run into that error you can simply go to your cql console here and just say use Quine which is the name of the workspace um where your data is and you can paste this script in to get the Quan scheme of properly created um so you may need to do that step before running it now uh once once you've done that um you can basically come here and run the Quine server um by running a Java minus jar command passing in that Quine conf file and uh yeah just you know self uh self-executable jar here um and that will boot up our our Quine server which should be running on locally on on Port 8080. and uh silly me I just forgot to save my uh Quinn conf so it hadn't gotten the token in there uh so when I re-ran it it's great all is working and the coin app server is running um now I can basically hit refresh and there's my Quant server running great now uh this is interesting um but you know maybe not as interesting as a database would actually with data in it so what we might want to do is load up some some data um we can do that very simply by downloading this attempts.json file which is a recipe from Quine for detecting a password spring attack it's just one of the many things that that they can do um so what we're going to do is uh shut down the server really quickly um just by using a curl command and that does a nice graceful shutdown as opposed to just uh you know control seeing out of it and then uh from there um what we can do is pass it the um call the Quine uh Java minus jar command again but handed this password spring argument which allows it to import and directly stream in uh the streaming file here this attempts.json data so there's about 5500 records in here um so what we'll do is a little magical video editing and some hold music and we'll uh we'll upload all these records in just a couple minutes to Astra [Music] foreign tastic so now we've got all 5500 records ingested and if we go and look at the Quine system dashboard you can see here that uh there's definitely activity going on as is there with your astrodb database as you can see here in the Prometheus grafana dashboards and um if we uh go to the the Quine graph Explorer itself you'll see great there's uh there's data loaded up um and you know you can start to start to look into it um so more more to come on this but uh sound sounds like everything's up and running and that brings us to the end of our our example here look forward to getting your feedback and to what you develop with Quine and astridb please reach out on uh Discord or uh on Twitter or any of our other you know slack communities or anything like that if you would like to get help or give us feedback thank you very much [Music]",
