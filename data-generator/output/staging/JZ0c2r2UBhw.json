    "text": "[Music] previously our discussion has centered on schemas in this section we add focus to config and a number of operations involving dse search indexes as stated earlier you can create and maintain dsc search indexes using cql alone or also use the apache lucene legacy xml encoded data files and the dse tool command line utility most of the commands you run using cql and dse tool will be data center wide in scope a very small number of the commands like checking new dse search index build completeness require dse tool and our single node in scope creating adding or updating resources file like a synonym file can currently only be completed using dse tool and our data center wide in scope entering a longest section then we detail a number of dse search index examples using cql create search index is entirely the first command you need to run after which you often run a number of alter search index statements to get exactly what you want in the first example a dse search index is created on every column in the name dse table fun and easy please do this only if you're developing or on a non-production size system for any larger data set we would only dsc search index columns we are certain will actually use said index the last example begins to explain that a fuller create search index statement names only specific columns with specific schema specifications as well as specific config settings and more here we see two or three examples detailing you can name specific columns to the dse search index and even set specific attributes like doc values equals true or false recall that upon receipt of the first and only create search index statement the dse search runtime automatically records metadata about the dse table primary key here we see the copy field and specific field attributes namely doc values true or false indexed true or false and others may be set via a create search index you may exclude any dse table column proper from the dse search index either by never naming them never adding to the dse search index metadata or by using the excluded switch to aid in setting given dsc search index schema metadata attributes quickly a number of profiles exist that contain many common or popular config related settings each of the profiles acts as a macro for a single or set of attributes that might also have been set at the field type or field level officially apache lucine supports table joints although a better title for this ability might be sql nested selects you can't actually join two tables using apache lucine if you need to support nested selects aka joins using dc search there are field type and field attributes you need to add if you never plan to join you should leave the resources needed to support joins uncalculated or uncollected as a profile space saving no join sets these field type and field attributes for you space-saving slow tree precision at a high level you can if you choose index every integer key value distinctly yielding ultimate performance but performance always takes resource in this case additional disk space to record every integer key value distinctly if you use the index associated with that integer infrequently or can suffer a little less performance in favor of saving a good measure of disk space you can dial this back a bit at a high level imagine dc search will index ranges of integer key values saving disk space when looking for a particular integer key value dse search will position at the start of the range containing the integer key value then scan within said range slower but less disk space certainly this precision this ranging is available for most or all of the tree based column types and the space saving all profiles sets both profiles above the default query field can be set using config and at the query level the cql select level here we see the default query field set via config default query fields are handy when trying to write query predicates referencing multiple tokens for example find all movie titles containing clifford the big red dog there are many ways to write this query including using a default query field also using config you can tune dse table by dse table how changes to the dse table proper are written to the dse search index and how dse search index queries are cached dse search cache queries require the fq filter and a specific syntax discussed later in addition to dse search index schemas with their profiles and config attributes are a number of dsc search index options in effect how should dsc respond if the dse search runtime discovers an inconsistency in any of its index lists the choices here are recover and re-index descriptions as shown also how should the dse search index runtime respond when receiving casting errors the end user program trying to index unsupported data types and similar just like the cql described table command there is a cql described search index command as there is a schema both pending and active for any given dsc search index there is also a pending an active config output is written using an xml format once you become comfortable with what dse search indexes can deliver you will commonly design a create search index statement followed by a number of alter search index statements why largely because of dsc search text analytics specifying the very specific and perhaps multiple treatments to any given dse table column can become several lines long you could try to fit all of that into one create search index statement but why it would be the equivalent in a relational database store procedure that is 10 pages long don't do it the dse search index exists as metadata only until you deploy why not just simplify and organize all of what you want into a small number of well-delineated simple commands and that command is alter search index you can alter the schema or config or both you can add drop or modify dsc table columns to the dse search index and more recall that all changes will be pending until you deploy using alter search index you can add drop or modify all of the topics we discussed previously field types fields attributes to same config copy fields dynamic fields and more in these two examples we add an existing dsc table column proper to the dse search index in this second example we see where we can specify any specific attributes to the field type or field as required by our application the note at the bottom is a topic we want to detail on the next page use types.fieldtype when changing field types and use fields dot field when changing fields in the first example we are adding a field type of string field to the dse search index schema in the second example we add a field to the dsc search index schema and we specifically set the attributes doc values equal true and indexed equal true if there was a dse table column named title sort we'd be done as it turns out the third example displays a copy field from title to title sort if this group of code is accurate title would have to be a column in the dse table proper probably a dsc column of type text just to be clear this example could have been delivered without the copy field and instead could have just dse search indexed titled directly as written the end user program would have known to call to range and sort on a dse search index key column titled title sort and not title generally we state you can dsc search queries just using cql or using dsc search predicates in json format or non-json format you can issue create or alter search index statements using cql json and or the legacy apache leucine xml encoded data files if you wish alter search index statements can also be written using a json map format minimally the use case for this is to avoid issuing multiple cql alter search index statements to accomplish the same end goal in this example we see the cql json map formatted alter search index command in this example we add a field type of type text field the analyzer for field type is specified to be the standard tokenizer generally split on white space and discard punctuation this tokenizer is followed by the lowercase filter in effect fold the dse search index key value to lowercase in this example we create a second field type similar to the previous field type but add a stop word filter in effect do not index words like the and and ah and others as specified in the stopwords.txt data file recall that stopwords.txt is a resource file and must be added to the dse search index after the dse search index is initially created but before any dse alter search index statement makes reference to this named resource in most previous examples we added a field to the dse search index schema using set we can modify a dsc search index field example as shown here we see the syntax to drop a field from the dsc search index the source column in the dse table proper is left unchanged it's just no longer indexed and then examples for dropping a field from the dse search index the second example details how to drop a copy field and the last example leaves a dse search index column but drops an attribute onset column specifically the doc values attribute just as you can add modify or drop a dsc search index schema element you can perform the same to dsc search index config attributes in this example we modify the manner in which dsc core propagates data modifications from the base table to the dse search index previously all of our discussion has centered on changing the dse search index schema or config by default a cql search index will automatically deploy but all of our cql alter search index statements only change metadata as an aside to avoid actually creating a dsc search index upon receipt of a dse search create search index use the options reindex equals false attribute here we begin a discussion of four commands to actually deploy our dse search index reload search index moves any dsc search index schema and config changes from pending to active no dse search index rebuild occurs as the result of a reload following a reload the call to rebuild will actually deploy any changes cause the new index to be built and made available to any end user applications any current dse search index will remain in place taking end user requests until the new index build is complete once the new index is complete the old index is dropped with no interruption in service the delete all parameter is handy if you do not have space to store to concurrent copies of any index on disk be aware however newly arriving dsc search queries may receive incomplete result sets as the old index went away and the new index is still being built you can track dc search index build progress via a form of the dse tool utility shown and there is a drop search index command obviously if you're using this command while developing be aware that this command also drops any resource files by default use delete resources equal false to override this behavior if that is your preference delete data dir calls to actually delete the dsc search index data files on disk should that also be your preference while changes to the dse table proper will automatically update the key value entries in the dse search index and this is tunable when you are developing sometimes you're in a hurry the commit search index calls to have changes to the dse table proper immediately pushed to the dse search index and then just a quick note dse search index builds happen asynchronously in the background but if you feel you need it do not forget about the cql shell specific environment variable setting cql search management timeout seconds",
