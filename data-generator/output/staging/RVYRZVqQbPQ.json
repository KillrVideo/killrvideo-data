    "text": "[Music] hello my name is Simon Ambridge and I'm a solutions engineer with data stacks and today I'm going to show you how to use the azure CLI to deploy ed data stacks cluster so first off I'm not going to assume that you've got the azure CLI tools installed yet so if you do a Google search for as your CLI install this first result will be this really helpful article from Microsoft on how to install it so this goes through their different installers there's also a docker container that has it pre-installed as well but I usually find it's nice to have it running locally so once its installed locally you can go over to your command line and login to the CLI and everything is working alright you should be able to run the command as your group list and that goes out to Azure and it connects and it sees what resource groups you have running and it lists all those off and you can see that here that that's worked so I've been working as your CLI now the next thing I need to do is I need to make a copy of the arm the as your resource manager templates for deploying data stacks so if I switch back to a web browser these are the arm templates they're up on github they're publicly available they're under the data stacks partner network so if I click this copy to clipboard link right here I can then copy the entire repo so in my home directory I'm going to type the command git clone and then paste that URL that we copied so I should probably call that out that I'm assuming you have the git command line tools installed here so hit enter and it goes out and it downloads some things and now if I do an LS locally and have a look I have a new directory as your resource manager DSC so I'm going to change directory into that directory do analysis again there are a couple of things in here there's the marketplace offer this is the sort of create ui rapid that we use in our azure marketplace offer it's not really very interesting or useful outside marketplace but it's really more left there so that you can inspect it and understand the things that we're doing in marketplace and it's just a wrapper around of things that we have in this directories specifically the marketplace offer is a wrapper around the single DC folder that we can see here but since you're looking at the command line my assumption is that you want to do something more interesting than just a single data center so let's change directory into a multi DC and do an LS in there and you can see a couple of things here one is a deploy script so I can cap the deploy script and this is our main entry point it creates a resource group and that's a container for all our different artifacts it then runs a Python program that generates an arm template and then finally it runs this command here you see the azure group deployment create and it creates a deployment using the template that we generated just now and that's that's been saved into this directory so there's also a note here that it uses cluster params Jason so let's take a look at cluster params Jason really quickly what's in here it's interesting it's got a list of locations there you can edit can be any number of locations and then for each location the number of nodes to create and the VMS to use so in this case we're using a d1 v2 and finally there's a username and password these are going to be the username and passwords for all our machines once they're all built and running so if I want to deploy this 310 DC cluster all I have is a delirious dot slash deploy and then the name of the resource group I'm going to call it Ben one and hit enter it goes away it creates the resaw group and now it's creating the deployment and and this once it's creating this this deployment it's it's going to run asynchronously so even if my network connection to Azure fails the deployment will come almost certainly can still complete in the background so at this point let's flip back to our web browser and look at one other thing before we do that let's see it's 549 p.m. so let's remember that time because that will tell us how long this whole thing took so I'm going to pop over to resources azure calm login to my work account single sign-on and I'm now in resources or as eurocom so if I drill down I can see been won already so it's already made a bunch of stuff for been won some virtual machines availability set free availability availability sets of course one for each location so there's other VMs ten of them in each location only one new node to run op Center that's the administrative tool and and so on so at this point I'm going to pause our recording and I'll resume it once the deployments completed alright so we're back it's 621 p.m. now so it took roughly 30 minutes to run the deployment and its output this URL here so if we go to this URL be able to see our newly deployed data stacks cluster so I'll go copy that go over to a web browser paste that in hit enter and we see loading up Center okay so it's giving this little error saying that some agents have failed to connect when op Center was started this is a this is a quirk we see when off center started the first time you can do either of two things really you can just ignore this and carry on or you can just restart absent er and the problem will go away so for now I'm just going to dismiss it and ignore the warning and you can see here the cluster health it says east u.s. central us and west us there are 10 nodes in each so I'm still kind of amazed at how superb this is it took about 30 minutes and we deployed 30 machines across the u.s. in geographically distributed database cluster so if we click over here we can see a view of the other cluster I'm going to zoom out a little we can see the different nodes in it we've got ten in East ten in Central and ten in West so right so let's really quick go restart op Center and to see if that fixes the problem so I'm going to copy that URL there and it clear SSH to the data stacks account on that node just going to get rid of the HTTP at the beginning alright so yes do you want to connect enter my password that I specified earlier and my I believe it'll be sudo service opps enter D restart restart there it goes restarting Cassandra cluster manager ops enter D so let's go back to the web browser see if that helped hit refresh fantastic now it's talking to the agents correctly okay so what one thing it's interesting here now we can see that a couple of these nodes have gone yellow which means that they're under load so as I mentioned previously we started with these d1 single core nodes so even a small amount of load in this case probably just ops enter right into the database that's going to cause them to to show under load so so that's where we are a multi data center cluster all set and deployed with a single command from the azure CLI I'll set up a couple of other videos to show how to debug failed deployments as well as some recommended next steps once you've got a new cluster and I'll look forward to seeing you then you [Music]",
