    "text": "welcome to another episode of the distributed data show brought to you by data Stax Academy where we bring you the latest news and interview technical experts to help you succeed at building large-scale distributed systems [Music] hey everyone patch McFadden I am live in London for the distributed data show today I'm here with my colleague Alice you've never been on the show so introduce yourself okay sure I am a principal architect I've been with data stocks for about three years now just over that and I work primarily in the AMIA region so Europe UK of course and all this area and I work as a process consultant and I'm part of the professional services team so you get to see a lot of trouble I get to see a lot of trouble and I get to solve a lot of trouble or at least event did you bring some trouble today so Roberta is working with a customer that I'm working with and he's a consultant from a company called a pan yeah sure thanks for me so yeah my name is Roberto and I have been working with data sex just recently for the last six months yeah has been a very interesting experience and we were laughing because yeah we have gone through a lot of pain but also I think that there is a lot of satisfaction for what we have been seeing yeah lately well I mean this shows I mean we're supposed to be talking to engineers and so everybody knows engineering projects never go as planned and but I mean there this is why we get paid as yours is to figure things out so that I mean we want to talk about that some so maybe tell a little bit about the use case we can't name names but I thought it was really interesting so tell yes so we're in the process of implementing a solution that will serve to the customers a lot of data in a very quick reliable way so what we want to make sure is other systems have kind of at this layer yeah whenever we need information we just hit it so we are looking few things we are looking for availability we are looking for high performance and we are making sure that we don't have a single point of failure and all of that within a micro services approach so that a sax came into the equation and we have been working with alleys now for a long time have been mentioning and we are trying to solve these problems now one of the very interesting things that we have is that we are able to release very very fast so that's something that I found quite easy quite interesting because we have ragnar well we start talking about one single problem and right now yes no I think that we have to go live with four different services across this company that are going to serve different things so we are talking for example about personalization product later customer data even stock we are not managing stock as the master of stock but is what is serving those information that what so we have available well we've really narrowed this down to about a thousand or 2,000 companies now yeah so that's a pretty common problem with retail is this sort of thing yes yeah I know it helps a lot based on the fact that we are not only storing the data but also we have the search capabilities and it's helping us a lot on that because we can start thinking about well this is information that we have but how can we expose it how can we put it out there without actually training a very complex table models or carrying multiple tables or how do we make sure that we have all the information multiple times so it is bringing a lot of benefit to be using that Enterprise version yeah where we are balancing between denormalizing for time must use queries on the common query path as opposed to creating search indexes to allow this extra flexibility and accessing different ways so it's for each use case we are trying to do an analysis as to how the data is going to be used and that drives of course the choice of whether to go with the normalization or search and where to mix so denormalization I've always felt like there's a little bit of revulsion my god it's gonna create a lot of extra data but I mean you deal with this every day yeah and so what is your normal response to lead to normalization problems generally the approach to decide whether to denormalize or not is a consideration on how central that query path is to your application if you know that you're predictably going to query the data in this way and you know that you want to certain you want a really quick snappy response you want to be able to retrieve the data immediately then a native read is the fastest thing you can do of course right single partition key clustering column example and go and the structure in the key in the right way is really important to make sure that you can cater for these access patterns when when it comes to something that is a combination of criteria maybe the customer will be able to specify some of these but not everything or you can't quite imagine you can try to build out all the possible queries that will happen that's why new ones here the flexibility that search gives you all right yeah that's gonna lead into that so you decided to go a search because you needed an extra layer of flexibility so maybe describe that a little bit sure so we have very specific cases where we know for example we're talking about customers or product ID that's just we their normalized and we make sure we have all the data we need yeah so that's fine but there are cases where we are thinking about our sales associates or the people that are in stores and we need to have information about what customers they serve or what are the pros that they sell things that are not necessarily going to fit in terms of a primary key opportunity clustering columns where we say we have the information we don't want to create multiple tables because anyway we need to start extracting that information and that's when we are deciding to use the search capabilities okay so now is that embedded in the data model itself or is it like something that sits on the side I mean in that I think that's a really common misconception it's a search insisting that sits over here that's near your data but it isn't exactly integrated with your data and I'm sure you hear the same thing yeah this is this is one of the initial discussions that we generally have when we talk about using search and why would you want to go down this approach because the idea of having data that is stored natively and accessible natively and also indexed in place so basically allowing the same date ought to be accessed in a more flexible way is radically different to having to maintain a separate indexing cluster and this is what CQ our syntax example of that from the same driver with the same syntax with same secure language that has got extensions to humble search queries and this really allows a seamless integration between normal securities like traditional ones and search enhanced ones so that's quite powerful and that's played out quite nicely for the teams I think working with Young's it seems like they almost don't make a difference between and I think that's very important because the teams I need to get for good or bad we don't need to get into the details of how does that work how is this happening they just have the information accessible to themselves so that's facilitating our ability to develop because they have the information there we just tell them how they need to use it and they don't worry about it they don't need to be aware of those constraints it's good for them to know but it enables them to actually get the job done without worrying too much about what technology is in place so that level of obstruction it's very very useful so this is really I mean and I love the idea of developer experience making developers more effective so they can build applications faster definitely less and less friction yes so that's what this is about yeah yeah without having to switch drivers or switch it between different technologies for two calls to different API so that that makes a difference I think that makes our development faster so we are as I was mentioning we are using micro services approach right and we are using servlets approach as well on top of that so everything is good all those things that we have all the buzzwords there eventually is working interesting but the important thing is that is one single function where we can do a retrieve of data without worrying if it's all or if it's cassandra is just our driver and it's providing that information that we need so that makes a huge difference I think there is also another interesting use case that we're going to look into shortly which is the store locator Oh locator that means you're special like you normally do you want to go on the site and say show me the stores in these radius or potentially you could even want to plan the map and show which sources are there and these capabilities are supported by search but these are like geometrics of box queries if you wanted to I don't think you're going to get to this level because probably for store locator is not necessary but you may even want to draw your own polygons and arbitrarily say we didn't be shaped the time during where are going to be I think I've seen a demo where someone has like draw your own polygons yeah like do I need to reinvent polygons but it shows off the power some use cases when I was looking for a house you need the polygons because you know the area but in your case no we don't your case would be more than radius probably or just what is the visible portion of the map have you ever seen a maps for US congressional districts those but I think there's a different problem anyway maybe when you think about search you don't necessarily think about geospatial but that's also one of the capabilities well and I data isn't about a thing sometimes it's there so there's metadata that's so important yes it's not just a number it's not a description but like aware and and I think today especially where data is trying to like manifest some global thing like the stores and where they're at and io T's and there's almost this blending of IOT and traditional data models and how do you sort that out so it sounds like a really interesting match here I think so I'm there's a lot of attention on all the things that we are going to do because we are serving different parts of the business so they are going to start coming with different needs so when we start talking about inventory as boring as it can be and but how we distribute the data and how the capabilities of assertion by time but it also becomes very important because now if we the way that we have model or tables right it's going to allow us to very very easy get stuck changes on certain locations right on a given time so those kind of functionalities are really really cool so I'm going to ask you this because as an Oracle DBA one of the things I used to run into all the time is people trying to index everything seems like this is a potential where I think they'll be really sensible with this and that's great to see because you know you want to index the data that you want to make searchable right you don't need to index everything you can retrieve all the data that is in the Cassandra table even if it's not indexed but you can only search the fields that you've been next what what what metrics get affected if you over index what will happen in your enterprise cluster Deus Ex Enterprise cluster bad things give me a smile yeah more memory consumption beginning the existing manage and also if you index fields that you don't need to index and they change then the result in unnecessary index updates so you need to maintain that you need to the space to basically store the indexing structures and you don't really get a benefit from it is it really that big of a difference do you think sometimes is it pronounced like oh wow you doubled your disk usage depends on the type of the index fields but in general the advices to choose which columns of course you don't you don't need to be super worried you can index comfortably what you need to and you can also alter the index later and add yeah other fields to it if you need to so you can start out with a certain idea and say okay we realized that we also need to query and filter on this particular field so we can audit and you're creating indexes using cql yes syntax oh yeah and also through in it as well yeah okay cuz that the act a long time ago when I first started using the solar part of Davis X Enterprise you had to use and use an XML file yeah to do that no it's no longer the case yeah the API and yes to listing that but the recommended way is to go through the security eyes and create index and something quite interesting for us is that we are on the process to automate or for pipeline yeah so the fact that we can use sequel queries to do that it's allowing us to programmatically do that in a very easy way appropriate very easy environment so it actually helps a lot to have that so it's built in at the schema of your system without having to be one of them that's one of the driving reasons behind to move this to secure so that's been quite exciting I think it's interesting I mean if you haven't seen DAC search in a long time it's probably a good idea to take another look because it has changed a lot yes it's really yeah it's really powerful technology and I see it as a way that complements the strengths of Cassandra itself because when you can do native access access that's brilliant yeah when you can't necessarily afford that in terms of denormalizing as we were saying earlier indexing through search is a really good option to have that flexibility built in okay sorry yeah so I think this has been really interesting Roberto I would love to have you on again we focused on search quite a bit here but I know you have other things to talk and yeah that's been very interesting and Thank You Alice for finally the I wanted you to be on this show for so long you're one of the smartest brains out there that no one knows yeah so we're gonna make you famous or a famous or famous sir probably see you a dude is xyx ahead the accelerate conference though I would imagine so yeah and you too that's my plan camera alright well thanks everyone and we'll see you next time thank you Cheers thank you for joining us again for the distributed data show we love your feedback so go to
