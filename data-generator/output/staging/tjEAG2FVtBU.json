  "description": "By now you've probably experienced generative AI in the form of text. Ask ChatGPT a question, get an answer. But what if you could ask about the weather and your web application could show you the current weather and 10-day forecast as an image? What if you could ask it to play Pacman?\r\n\r\nJoin DataStax and Vercel for a 45-minute livestream where we’ll learn about the Vercel AI SDK and how it enables developers to deliver generative UI experiences using LLMs and React Server Components. \r\n\r\nDuring this livestream, we'll roll up our sleeves and walk through:\r\n--Creating a new Next.js project with the Vercel AI SDK\r\n--Generate some UI components with the help of OpenAI\r\n--Wire it up to Astra DB to inject real data in our components\r\n\r\nTo wrap up, we’ll host a live Q&A where you can ask technical questions.

nerds out there um it's great to see you um sorry I'm gonna take these sung I was I just got back from react Miami um so I've got these sunglasses um it was an awesome event uh Michael uh I saw a ton of black triangle crew at uh at react Miami were were you there I was I was not there nope uh we rotate who gets to go visit when and where and there's all we're we're amidst the peak conference season now because we got react Miami that just happened we got react comp coming up we got versel ship coming up as well too so um yeah yeah we tried to spread tried to spread that travel love across the group so I wasn't there but I do know that there was a fleet of people yeah it was it was an amazing event I sure how many people on the stream uh were were at react Miami but it's a fantastic event couldn't couldn't recommend it more highly but hey uh so welcome to today's live stream um gonna gonna kind of level set for folks that are tuning in uh first of all uh welcome like uh if if if you're if you're here and you're in the chat room feel free to uh to introduce yourself and let us know uh where you're from um it's always great to see uh what cities and countries uh folks are dialing in from uh today's stream is going to be uh all about JavaScript uh and all about generative UI and if you don't know what generative UI is then this is like the the right stream for you all to be tuned into because quite frankly I'm not sure that I knew what generative UI was as recently as a month or two ago I feel like it's a term that's been coined kind of recently and um The more I've learned about it the more you know my head has kind of exploded a little bit and it's made me think about all the things that are possible with AI and um and uh web development so uh all right so let's talk a little bit about um the agenda today so we're going to try to keep this to a tight 45 minutes we reserve the right to go over because we're all just really excited to share the stuff with you um but we're gonna we're going to start off with some introductions um myself Michael and Alex are gonna introduce ourselves uh and then we're GNA dive straight in um to uh to Michael um who's going to talk about the versel AI SDK and a bunch of other cool stuff uh that verell is building to help developers more easily build amazing AI applications um so that's going to set the table uh for Alex who's going to dive in this uh really awesome integration that data Stacks built into the versell experience uh I don't want to sort of spoil it but basically like he's going to show you how from within the versel experience you can you can interact with data saacks uh databases and just get up and running super duper fast uh and then uh I'm going to kind of close the live stream at least from a Content perspective talking about uh kind of building on both what Alex and Michael have talked about um but sprinkling a little bit of uh data like into those generative those components that we're generating in our web applications um and you'll and you'll you'll see why uh as as Michael is kind of going through his demo um but uh that's kind of that's that's how I'm going to kind of like wrap things up uh and then we will have time uh for Q&A um so that kind of tinks takes me to a little bit of housekeeping so first of all um I want to just say hello to everyone who's watching the stream um I know this is this is happening right here on the crowdcast platform and everyone in the chat room hello uh but this is also going out on LinkedIn and YouTube and Twitter so just like hello and welcome to everyone who's watching watching um if you are here on crowdcast um if you look to the right um most of you are already in the chat experience and thank you so much uh for saying hi we've got oh we've got Olaf from San Carlos hey Olaf um uh you'll also notice over on the right there's a box with a question mark and that is a Q&A component uh and we would love for you to use the Q&A component um to ask ask questions of myself Alex or Michael as we're going through the live stream um because it's just a stuff gets lost in the chat um but if you ask it in the Q&A widget um it's a great place for us to kind of capture these questions and you'll notice even if you don't have a question to ask um or when you are thinking of asking a question you can go review all the questions that other people have asked and it's like Reddit or like Hacker News you can kind of vote things up that you're like oh wow like I want to know the answer to that also so please use the Q&A widget um please upvote things that you also want to know about um and it'll just kind of help us as we get down to the Q&A section um all right moving along uh so uh we're g to do some quick uh some quick introductions um see let me see if I can get to my next slide fantastic all right so uh this is this is always a fun thing to do um you know we've got new people on on the stream um every time we do it and we're so happy to have Michael today but you know we are hopefully like we're we're new to a lot of you so we're going to kind of go around the horn and we're going to introduce ourselves uh like so let everyone know um where you're currently dialing in from um what you do um at your company uh and then uh and then the third question which is kind of like I like to surpr I'm kind of the host so I get to come up with these things uh it's a surprise question um I want you to tell everyone uh like one of your favorite vacation locations and this is on my mind because like I just just I just got back from this react conference in Miami um and so I'm kind I'm kind of in a little bit of a vacation state of mind I'm going to let Michael and Alex think about this um so I'll go first uh so my name is Carter rasa um I'm I'm here in Seattle Washington um I'm not a I'm not a native of Seattle I actually grew up um in the Washington DC area um but I moved out here like over over 15 years ago so I've been in Seattle a really long time I really love the Pacific Northwest um I work at data Stacks uh and I'm the uh I lead our developer relations team um which pretty much means I spend almost all of my time um building cool generative AI applications talking to developers going to conferences um it's uh it's truly uh just one of the best jobs that you can you can have um all right so I'm gonna go eenie meeny Mani Alex why don't why don't you go next and and I miss your your fun question Carter um oh fa fa favorite vacation like favorite or you know one of your favorite vacation spots oh no wait wait and I'm sorry I didn't you missed your answer you're right hold on hold on so like I'll go um so look I just got back from Miami Miami is awesome love it but if I had to recommend one place for people to check out that I was surprised at how awesome it was Iceland um my my wife and I went to Iceland like maybe I forget like 18 months ago or something and it's just spectacular like you can it's just it's big enough that there's a lot of cool stuff to see it's small enough that you can literally drive around the whole thing um it's volcanic I mean like there in fact there's actually unfortunately there's an eruption happening right now but when there aren't eruptions um it's just an amazing beautiful place with these uh you know with all this like geothermal um like you know Hot Springs uh fabulous like Nordic culture so uh and if you happen to live in Seattle uh there's a direct flight so Iceland is a is is my answer thank you Alex and now I'll I'll turn it over to you cool um I'm I'm Alex also based in Seattle also grew up in the DC area um and I lead our developer ecosystem team I'm so working on awesome Integrations like the one with brel that we will demo in a little bit um in my favorite fun vacation spot I'd say uh the the fun ski trip to Park City Utah sner Park City nice and I'll hand it off to you Michael hi uh my name is Michael nney I am uh I lead our devr organization inside of verell as well um and a lot of the same activities uh that Carter mentioned as well too lots of community involvement and engagement um just speaking with other Engineers talking with them figuring out what they're trying to build and how we can help uh assist in that um so yeah that's it's it's great I love the community aspect I love the building aspect I I love how it all comes together because we're all trying to make really cool stuff um favorite vacation I am not oh sorry where am I base where am I lived I live in De Moine Iowa uh so it's a super popular destination for many people to to come and see um I'm I'm born raised educated here in Iowa so like I've got a really small box um I'm not super well-traveled either um but I have um prior to kids when my wife and I were first married um we did go to Maui and that that was a very awesome experience um mau's amazing is so amazing yeah highlight I've been to Maui I plus one Maui it's fantastic um definitely it's like it's it's it's probably the best I think it's the best Hawaiian island because it's bigger than Kawai so it kind of has more more stuff to do and more stuff to and it has like you know like Grocery Stores um but it's like smaller than the big island so you still kind of feel like you're in a tropical wild Place compared to the big Island so I highly recommend it all right um I think people people are have have have gotten to know us um but before we dive into the code we are running a raffle um so uh I I recently bought one of these um Fujifilm instant cameras and these things are absolutely amazing um in fact I'm going to take a selfie right now with all of you so just go ahead and smile awesome and while the while the while while Michael is talking I'm actually going to I'm going to print this photo on this camera if you want to win um this camera by the end of the stream all you need to do is scan that QR code or go to that URL and enter our raffle um so we we'll don't worry we'll we'll put we'll put the link in the chat um but oh yeah look it's it's printing right now this thing's amazing uh so we we'll put the link in the chat um but just go ahead and NL raffle and and don't worry we're going to pay this off um I'm actually going to use uh Vector search at the end of the raffle to pick the winner completely randomly like it's going to be super duper fun um so yeah go ahead and uh scan that QR code go to the URL well Michelle um or Alex or I will share the URL in the chat um but without further Ado um I am going to turn it over toh to Michael who's going to take us through uh everything that we need to know about the versel AISD and just this thing called generative UI yeah thank you before we jump into some screen sharing and whatnot I kind of wanted to paint a picture um of where we're going to go and how we're going to get there um just given the very broad audience here uh I kind of want to start us from the beginning and work our way up a little bit to what uh generative UI is and and why we believe it's a a game-changing future for the next Evolution inside of AI um but before we get there we'll start with the basic building blocks I'm not going to take you through some one-onone session where we're talking about what is an llm and all that kind of stuff we'll we'll go through my goal is to go through um a speedrun of sorts from starting a brand new from scratch nextjs application throwing in some versel AIS SDK to get something built uh quickly and then we'll we'll dive into the more deeper parts of what we're here to talk about with generative UI stuff does that sound good cool let's do it let me get to sharing screen cool so we should have a little bit of inception here with the stream and I'm going to go to my code editor here um I'm going to start off just with building a brand new uh nextjs application so we're going to do MPX create next app we'll make sure we have the latest version does that look does that look big enough uh to you over there Carter just a just a couple clicks bigger Michael sure yeah aw y cool so I'm just going to select all the defaults here for creating a new Next app and we'll let it do its thing cool all done I'm gonna have go ahead and open that up here oh it looks like I got to increase the font here on this one too all right so this is just your basic you know vanilla right out of the box xjs application and uh show that off we'll just do this we'll get our local server up and running good to go we'll pop over here and make sure that everything is working there we go brand new out of the box next application um and there's not a whole lot going on here it is using the new app router uh which was launched in next1 13 you can still use the pages router if you want to but just because we're future focused here especially talking about AI we'll just go ahead and and roll with the app router and pretty basic setup um we have uh our layout which pretty much doesn't have a whole lot of in it it's just an HTML and body tag and then we also have a page here which has a lot more going on on because of what you've seen on the screen there where it has a couple of different links to documentation and whatnot but we'll we'll get out of that in a second so really what I wanted to accomplish here was an introduction then to the AIS SDK um I believe you all have a call to action link um I'm assuming it's being shown um while I'm here but essentially this just links to our um versel AIS SDK getting started documentation um and I think one thing that when people hear about AI they think it's this big complex topic which it is there's some seriously smart engineers and companies uh out there doing some uh really cool and amazing things and it takes a lot of brain power um but we wanted to make AI approachable to to everybody and it's the same reason why we built versell the platform it's the same reason why we built nextjs the framework right all of it is to accelerate you from whatever idea you have to a finished product as quickly as possible and the the AISD accomplishes that same thing you can go deep into the weeds with you know all the different uh AI AP out there not and their docs and you know hooked up to them all that kind of but again in the name wanting to to be productive and get started quickly that's why we created uh the versell aisk not only does it allow you to interface with a whole bunch of different um AI API but it also gives you some benefits in in consistency as far as what to expect for output and we'll talk about why that's important along the way as well too so I'm not going to read the quick start here verbatim um but we're going to skim through this real quick just again to show you in a speedrun type fashion how you can get started with with AI and building uh AI applications super quickly um so we've already created our our next app we don't need to do that there's a few additional things that we're going to need to install here probably should bump up the font here as well too so we're going to install the AI SDK we're going to install open Ai and we're going to install uh Zod as well too which is essentially just a a validation framework around schemas and whatnot yeah zod's awesome so we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and install those three all right we're good to go and we need to have an open API key um I realized that I'm going to show it here really quickly I going to kill this key as soon as I am done demoing so don't get any crazy ideas uh but we're going to go over here we're g to add our I'm going to do this here I'm going to quickly flash up my notes get my key replace it here do that do that do that we're out of here and then we're going to create an API route for chat to for us to go and and interact with um an AI API in this case we are using open Ai and we'll talk through what's going on inside of here um as we build it so we're going to create a new path and file we're going to do uh API we're going to do chat and we're going to do route. TS and we're going to paste in the code and we're going to walk through it here real quick so we have the open a open AI uh package and we also have uh the versell AI SDK and we have two exports here and open AI stream and a streaming text response we go ahead and initialize um you know talking to open AI with our API key and then we just have a simple post request where we're taking the message that is sent to it and and we'll get to building the uui there uh we're connecting it to open AI specifying the model saying that we want streaming and all that kind of stuff um and then we pass it to versel AI SDK open AI stream which essentially allows us to start receiving information as soon as uh open AI starts sending it back to us and displaying it back to the screen which is what the streaming text response is so we're opening the stream and then we're passing it back to the UI is what we're going to do here so that's it so far we've we've covered 25 lines of code there and we're already talking to open AI next we're going to wire up a simple UI so I'm just going to copy everything that's going inside of here and again we'll talk through it real quick too so I'm going to open up my page I'm going to paste it all in here and let's let's minimize some stuff here so that we can actually see what's going on so it's just a react component and again we're importing um the react side now of vsels aisk and we're doing a use chat so it's just a hook that essentially gives us access then to these four things um it's a an array of messages so as we interact back and forth with uh an AI we're essentially keeping track of where we are the things that we have asked and the responses that we have gotten back uh input is essentially just the current value uh of the input that we're submitting here handling the change input again think of it just like a use State type of hook um but it's baked into the use chat and then we have a submit Handler which is then going to automatically talk to this predetermined route now you can set up options here instead of use chat to make it use something that's not the default but by default it does look for API chat route as the actual endpoint which is why you don't you don't see anything specified here it just is magically talking to it behind the scenes so if we go back now to our application actually I'm going to do one other thing just because it looks a little gnarly I'm going to get rid of the gradient that's happening in the background here because otherwise it's going to it's going to look funky so we'll do that and now we'll go back to our application and so here we are we have our UI which is simply just an input and it should all be hooked up to um open AI so we're going to go ahead and ask what is data Stacks oh man let's see hey there you go nice not too bad and again because we're keeping track of the the the queue of messages we can keep asking things back in Forth what is verel and we should get a reply there and you can see it it gives you a typing es you know type of look that's the streaming that's happening right so as it gets pieces of the response back from open AI it is adding that onto the existing message in a stream um which is super powerful because you actually gives you instant feedback right you're not having to wait for the entirety of the message to be built by Ai and then you have a big loading indicator that Waits forever it's actually streaming it back to your client for you so that was the super duper speedrun of just getting hooked up with um open AI now what I wanted to start calling out here um a little bit is uh what I would say is is a term that we're that we're starting to coin which is model portability uh and what I mean by that is like so one it's super helpful that no matter what you are what API you're working with when you're wrapping things with the versell AISD K like we can change what we're talking to in the background whether that's a completely different service or a different type of model and our UI doesn't have to change barely anything is even going to need to change inside of our route handlers well too so for example here you can see that we were starting for we were starting with uh GPT 3.5 turbo right so I mean I can literally with one line of code replace this with GPT 4 hit save I'll come back to our application and we'll start all over what is data stacks and you should see a slightly different answer because we're actually talking to a different um model here but we didn't have to change anything else gp4 is way chattier by the way um but we didn't have to change anything else we didn't have to change anything about our UI we just simply specified a different model using using the same API provider and open Ai and and that's it now going even further than that um it does take a little bit more work but the the whole idea behind this model portability is say something new comes out right like Facebook announced llama 3 um what was it last week or the week before time kind of blurs together but it think of oh my gosh well I'm I'm I'm deeply I i' I've deeply written you know an integration into open AI I want to now experiment with llama 3 I guess I got to go build a whole new API or whatever um you wouldn't have to go through nearly the amount of rework here you could just import from llama package you could just specify a different model but hooked up to the versell aisk you're going to get the same responses back and that's what we're providing through the SDK is kind of this predictability right you can interchange things behind the scenes in the back end and you still interact with things on the front end in the exact same way meaning that you can experiment depending on what kind of application You're Building you could have like almost a model explore right like we have with our own playground um if you go to sdk. verel doai you can mess with different models in real time and again you could build something in that way or you could even just decide to change services completely it it provides that level of flexibility um and and speaking further more to that um I'm G to quickly just mention here that and this is Hobby this isn't anything that is extra or you know that you have to have a pro account for or anything uh this is just my personal hobby uh account here on versell and we had now have this uh AI Integrations tab as a part of that as well too uh and you can see that we offer all kinds of different models here inside of for sell the platform and you can even filter down between you know what what is just chat back and forth what what can you do image manipulation with what can generate code audio um you know all those kinds of things but rather than having to go and like sign up accounts for at all these other you know different AI providers figure out how to hook them all up we've we've really brought that integration into the vers ecosystem here so if we did want to check out something like llama right we could hit explore here and that'll take us to the to this you know essentially the the play page or the playground page of llama and you can you can test it out right here um I mean it's not like a free-for-all there's there's a limited number of generations uh because you know AI does cost money but we can type what is uh data Stacks in here too and we can go down and we can run this and so we can see what llama produces in real time messing around here and we're like okay I like this version better than what we have as well too how about I add this model to my account and you can use llama through different providers you can set them all up here um you know you can I can go to my replicate integration here and here's everything that you need to get started it's already hooked you up with your token you don't have to go and create an API token and sign up for a replicate account it's it it walks you through that entire process it gives you what needs to change and you can notice what what is actually changing in here compared to what we had in our other application as well too right like hey you're just specifying that you're using replicate now instead of open Ai and you're passing in the API key there but notice how much of this looks really the same right and then you're doing the exact same thing you're passing it to the AIS sdks replicate stream and then you're turn returning that stream to a text response and nothing needs to change about your you why it's all the same dude this is awesome all right how we doing we good so far Carter no we're we're awesome um yeah okay so I want to then transition then to the generative the the generative UI part side of this right because I think it's pretty easy to grasp your mind around you know the chat side which is super cool we saw how easy it was to get up and running and get started with that kind of stuff but now we're moving into you know a new era of interactive AI and that's where really this uh generative UI has has come into play as far as like terminology is concerned and so rather than just text back and forth um we're essentially creating the the core pieces um so to speak inside of the versel AISD in order for you to return things back besides text which actually have better visual representations or even interactive representations um so if we just walk through this a little bit here as well too like you could ask it about you know if you're hooked up to one of those um image services that that we looked at at the integration just a little bit ago and you you start asking for like paintings you could actually visually show the paintings that are returned um you could actually you know build out a small calendar component to show upcoming events if you were if you were hooked up to a service that that allowed that kind of stuff and this is all done through two new Concepts that we introduced in in the latest version version three of the versel AIS SDK and it's this AI State and this UI State um and essentially it just allows you to control all the way down at the response and server level the ability to uh create your state models but then also return react server components uh back streamed back to the client um where you can actually do interactive stuff um so we're going to go through and we'll do a speedrun here and then I'll show you um you know a a more finished or more Complete product and then that will allow us then to transition into uh what Alex is going to show off here uh so we've already installed most of these most of these things already we already are hooked up to the versel AIS SDK and open AI stuff we already have our environment variable so let's just get into uh the meat here so I'm going to copy all this code and I'm going to go back to our editor here and we're going to talk through this um so we're going to create an action TSX file now um and an action uh is a server action which is where that comes from that that terminology and so this is all stuff that's happening down on the server side of things so we'll walk through this real quick again establishing an open AI uh instance we create a dumm a little dummy spinner component here which is just a loader component and we're going to create um the beginnings of an interactive and again I'll show you a more complete version of this but we're essentially gonna we're going to pretend that we're interacting with uh getting flight information and and you can you know mentally journey to where you could go with this you could choose your seats you could pick your upgrades you could do all that kind of stuff um with interacting with an AI but we're returning a basic flight card here where we have like your number where you're departing from where you where going to um and then we're we're kind of creating a fake API here um this would actually be like a external API that you could interact with here but we'll create a fake one here real quick and so here's our actual action again where this is a server action um using you know next app router terminology um we're essentially going to get the UI State and we're gonna kind of merge and update with it and we're going to then turn around and render not just texts that were being returned from from an AI stream or an AI API client we're actually going to do some complex manipulation of data and we're actually going to return a react server component uh so what we're going to do is we're gonna we're gonna interact with you know open AI using chat GPT 4 and once we get the text back we're going to do whatever we want to do based upon the information we're getting and we're going to return a react uh component that is streamed back to the client so we're going to show uh flight information which we showed the component that it's going to return earlier it's going to have a loading spinner and uh which is really just loading text which will probably happen quickly enough that it probably won't even be seen and we're going to return that flight card component right based upon the information that we got from an external API um and that down here is really just our our schemas and our models to make sure that everything is is typed safe that's really what's going on in this file but it gives us the opportunity to merge AI responses and even other external responses which again Alex is going to get into uh databases other API calls whatever you need to do to put together your answer and your information to then render an interactive UI we're going to scroll down past all that code and now we're going to go and we're going to copy this code into the layout and there's not much that's happening here but let's talk through it real quick essentially all we're doing is we're wrapping it in that AI action that we created there so that we have access to the streamed response and then down here we're going to take all this code and put it into the page component rewriting what we had just built and we'll walk through this one real quick as well too um we're controlling our own input State at this point and now we're hooked up to the new two new hooks that we talked about right the I State and the the use of actions and so we're going to again keep track of our messages here so that we can continue to build on top of each other there but whenever we submit the form now we're going to essentially wind up calling that server action and getting the streamed response back instead is really all that's going on here uh so if we go back to our application and we didn't mess anything up which is the joy of live demos right so we're going to send a message here and I'm going to ask about flight uh man if I could type we're going to ask about flight 111 come on demo people you can do it there it is there we go flight information for 111 departing from New York arriving in San Francisco and again we kind of faked that API but I think that's going to set us up for what Alex is going to talk about here um but really what we're what we're that was a super basic example and again this can go so many different places I think Alex is going to go and talk about the stock thing if I remember correctly but think of all the uis you could build with this right like you could return real time information about you know different altcoins meme coins um and whatnot as well too so there's there's a lot of power that you can build into these react server components that allow interaction and even just better visual experiences than having to interact with that text based chat that we're that we're all used to all right I'm gonna I'm gonna stop there and I'm gonna hand it over to Alex because I think he can pick it up from here awesome Michael thank this is ridiculously cool yeah it's like it's it's sick um yeah we'll uh well I think I think the biggest thing to to realize is just like it lowers the barrier right like it doesn't have to be this intimidating thing you can really start messing around pretty quickly and pretty easily um with without a whole lot of effort and a whole lot of work yeah no it's awesome um and I I'll just Echo Michael's point right I mean I think uh the what they're the work that they're doing is democratizing this kind of technology and these these kinds of experiences to everybody I mean if you were like a large engineering company with like a large you know engineering Workforce and Incredibly talented front-end Engineers sure you could have built everything that you saw right um but this is just putting these capabilities in the hands of all of us for you know for weekend projects um and it's just uh it's great to see it's it's one of the Reas it's not it's not even just that but like what is what is the key differentiator for your business let I mean whether whether whether it's you as a weekend hacker or even you as a big company like is creating all these API rappers to interact with these different models and and llms and apis is that is that really the key differentiator no it's probably your product it's probably your experience right and so it's like let let go of those things and and it's not saying that you can't you're not capable as an engineer you're you're probably very capable as an engineer but it's what what is the most valuable use of your time that's really what we're talking about here is how can we accelerate that idea and not get caught in the the mundane and the minutia of getting connected to all this stuff let's get to building let's get to creating that's the fun and exciting part well well said and great transition to Alex so Alex is going to dive in to showing all of you once you are using versell and you're building on versell how can you how can you sort of connect what you're doing to real data and real databases so Alex why don't you uh why don't you take it away yeah totally um so let's say so Michael loved your chatbot example and UI example um so let's say you want to build kind of a more complicated chatbot right that has access to some of your business's data um you would need to hook up the chat UI Michael just showed to a vector store um and we've now made that just ridiculously easy to do with verell um um so I'm just going to take over the screen share cool um so this is the dashboard of my resell account um Michael showed this a bit earlier but we'll share the link at the very bottom if you want to create a resell account um and you'll notice there's an Integrations tab on the top left I'm going to go ahead and select the integration Marketplace and what verell has done is they made it super easy to connect um nextjs apps to a bunch of different tools um and now as of last week um the that it's super easy connect to uh an asra Vector store so I'm just going to go ahead and click this and here we have two options we can either add the integration to an existing verell project or we can create one of we we can use one of our templates so I'm just going to go ahead and select just the simple chatbot template um really this is kind of based off the example Michael showed to show how easy it is to get started with versel and ashra so I'm going to hit select template I'm going to click this deploy button and here we get into the project creation and integration setup flow um so I'm going to be asked to create a git repo um I'm just going to name this rag bot starter and then here's where it gets super interesting so versel has just made it ridiculously easy to hook up um external tools to your resell project um so I'm just going to click add to connect Astra to my resell account and I'm going to sign in to my account cool um so now I'm in my as account I've created one before this call it's completely free um so feel free to give it a shout we have a really um generous free tier so you can do all this for completely free um I'm going to select my personal order and I've created a database before this call so I'm just going to select the chat database and um when I hit complete integration this is going to connect my versel project to my Aston database so I'm going to go ahead and do that and this is going to kick me back into the versale set up flow um so here I'm going to be asked to plug in a open AI key um I'll just do that real quick and I'm going to click deploy um so what's happening now is we're kicking off the versell deploy um so this is going to install dependencies load some sample data into my asid base um and set up the entire project um this is going to take kind of a couple minutes so while this um is setting up I'm going to go over to ashra to show the data being loaded just one more second and we'll start seeing some data you can see kind of walking through all the build steps here cool and we can see the data is starting to be loaded so we have collections here if I refresh I'll start seeing rows being inserted there we go so we have 11 records in Astro dat Explorer we can see we're just loading some sample um support URLs to include in our chatbot cool we're just loading more data and and to be and and Alex to be clear like the the deployment of the app to next is like almost instantaneous like What's Happening Here is mostly just the data being loaded right oh exactly yeah so a bunch of things are happening the the apps being built we're setting up all the environment variables we're loading all the data um so the next Supply is fast part it takes a little bit of time to load all the data and set up all the collections um it looks like it's complete now cool and if I go back to Rell um we've successfully deployed sample chatbot using the tech that Michael just displayed um connected to ashra um on this on this live stream I'm so here's kind of the chatot I can play around with wow um and what's especially cool so now I'm just going to click into um the project I just created I'm going to click to the environment variables um so you can see we've set up all your your database creds right so super easy to um use Astro in just a couple clicks M Carter I think I'll hand it back over to you yeah that was that was awesome um I know um the folks at data saxs who worked on this integration we're just incredibly excited about it um because it just it makes it like so brain dead easy to to E I mean I know I think Alex you wired it up to a database you already had created but there's also an option to create a database from scratch right so just I think for for folks that are building on for sell and already have already started working on their projects it's just adding the database is just so easy to do um so so thanks thanks for sharing that um I'm going to uh sorry I'm going to I'm going to speedrun um through through through what I want to share with with all of you to kind of like to kind of close out close out this uh this live stream right so you know Michael just absolutely beautifully set up like all the stuff that comes um with the versel AIS SDK that just takes a whole class of class of concerns away from you as a developer and just makes it easy for you to focus on like your idea your business logic like the stuff that you care about um Alex showed you how with just like a couple clicks um you can wire up that project to a vector store and what I'm going to show you right now is how you can start injecting actual data from a database into these uis that are being generated um so I'm going to go ahead and share my screen and we are going to uh dive into this uh quickly um all right so share screen share the whole screen I trust you folks um all right so I'm sharing my screen uh I have uh this is um this is basically a uh you know the versel AI SDK um the sort of one of the default version of it right and I have this running locally on my laptop uh and this is what you get out of the box or at least this is what you got out of the box a couple weeks ago when I worked on this uh versel likes to move fast so the the the design of this page has changed a little bit but uh it's ultimately the same thing so I'm going to go ahead and make it a little bigger so people can see but right now out of the box I can uh this this this uh this is an example of generative UI in the context of uh like asking qu asking questions about stock data um so I can go ahead and ask the question uh what is the price of Microsoft right um and you can see that the the AI SDK the way that it's wired up it understands exactly what your question is and what you're asking for uh and it knows how to select the appropriate uh react component to render the answer to your question and this is just absolutely beautiful and amazing and it's it's illustrative of like other other uh other exam other UI components and like other experiences that you can create however the problem with it um if uh if if you sort of if you have the stocks stocks app open on your open on your iPhone the problem is the data is wrong right um right now Microsoft is trading at $494 so cool so like you know as Michael said like this is a fantastic beginning to the app that you're trying to create but the question is like what do we need to do to actually make the data real this is for folks that build in generative uh AI this is kind of referred to as a hallucination right like the data it looks it looks real but um it it is it isn't real so I'm going to just very quickly walk through what it would take to to get real data and um and create experiences uh for your end users that are that are accurate so the first thing I'm going to do is uh I'm going to use uh the astrab typescript client uh and I'm going to import that into my project um the next thing I'm going to do is just like uh initializing you know any kind of API including you know open Ai and and any API you've ever worked with um I'm gonna use these credentials from my environment to initialize this data API client so um Astra DB is a nosql and Vector database um as Alex mentioned it's completely free for developers to sign up um and get started with uh and on top of this uh nosql in Vector database is a data API um that developers use to interact and this data API is a restful API uh and we have uh typescript um Python and Java clients that you can use to interact with the API so I'm going to go ahead and create a client right here and I'm going to get a handle to a particular database um and I can actually show you what that database looks like so going back over to Astra um I can click on this versell integration demo and uh I'll make the screen a little bit bigger but this is this is the database I'm hooking into and you can see uh here I have uh loaded actual uh stock price information uh into my database and you can imagine uh in a real world situation you could store this data and you could update it um as regularly as you want in order to keep the data up toate um and in fact like you you know there might be apis that you could work with to fetch this data but storing it in a database is just a fantastic way to Cache that data and minimize the the number of API calls that you're making so going back to my code um great so we're getting a handle to this database and I'm going to very very quickly walk through a couple basic things that are happening so I'm going to scroll down to where we are prompting open AI so right here we you can see we're using GPT 3.5 turbo and this is our system prompt um I'm going to go ahead and uh get this out of the way so you can see this so this is where we're telling uh the llm what kind of Bot it is and how it should behave um and this is this is the magic of both the versel AI SDK and open ai's um function calling capabilities so right I just I'm going to highlight this um right here we are telling the llm explicitly that if the user wants the price of a stock we're actually telling it to call a specific function this is open ai's uh function calling capability um and you as a developer this is completely like this is your playground right like you as the person building the application you can create as many of these functions as you want and you can create as many of the of the associated UI components as you want and the llm is basically just helping the user um get access to the functionality that they're interested in so instead of you know think about traditional uis where you know you have a nav or you have a menu where the user is having to be really explicit about what they want to do this just enables uh users to interact with your application using natural language and then the llm figures out what component to render so uh so great so so uh show show stock price is what we care about down here um this is this is this is how uh this is pretty brilliant um we have defined show stock price um but we also tell the llm really specifically like what this function does and in addition to a description we specifically tell the llm what kind of data um is required to invoke this component right so here we're telling it um very explicitly um that it needs to uh it needs to it needs to it's going to need um it's going to the llm is going to need to return like the price of the stock um the name or symbol of the stock and the change in the price of the stock this in the absence of what I'm about to show you this is where the hallucinations will come in like if if the llm knows this information it will pass it back but if it doesn't know this information it will effectively make something up um and now we're going to mitigate that so like what we want to do is there once again there's a function called show stock price so if I scroll down here you'll start to see um these uh these sections that are completion on function call so once the llm knows what function it the user wants to invoke this is where you actually Define like what those like the behavior of those functions in your code so we're going to go down here and remember we're looking for a function that's called show stock price and here we are here we are so completion on function call show stock price this is exactly where we need to make the change to go from the hallucinated data that the llm is returning to actual data from our database so I'm going to go ahead and uncomment these lines and I'll explain them so right now we're going to um use our client to our database to retrieve a a handle to a particular collection if I go back to astb um you can within a single database you can create these things called Collections and you can see that I have this collection called stocks so I'm going to uh I'm going to get a handle to that collection the next thing we're going to do is we know what symbol the you the user has asked for so we're going to look up the associated document in that collection and then once we get it back we're going to set the price um we're going to override the price that The llm Returned with the actual price from our database so I'm going to go ahead and save this and go back to the demo and I am going to hope that this worked so let's uh let's cross our fingers and see uh uh what the price of msft is awesome all right fantastic so it came back uh so I loaded the price of Microsoft based on today's open uh into my database at 4956 and I can very very very quickly prove that this is indeed what is happening so I'm going to use our data Explorer to look up this document um and here it is and sure enough if I expand this document you can go down to the current price and it is 4956 so that is it like all we needed this is all we needed to do to uh retrieve real information from a database and use it to inflate um or to initialize the generative the the UI component that our llm is telling us we need to use to satisfy the users's request um so yeah so I'm going to go ahead and uh stop sharing for just a second uh and kind of come back to my friends Alex and Michael so I went through that as fast as I as I possibly could um I know that we're run we're running short on time um so I'm going to very quickly uh share my screen again one more time so we can pick a winner for the raffle but before we do that um I uh I need your help so everyone in the chat I want you to uh please quickly tell me what your favorite color is and this will this will be explained in just a second so go ahead and Shout out colors in the chat uh and I'm just going to pick a random one that people that people provide and uh you know anyone anyone who and Alex and Michael you're more oh okay purple all right I got purple all right I want you to I want you to shout out um the city the city that you're currently from right now we're getting a lot of a lot of colors are flying in um but I'm gonna I'm going to wait for the first person okay boom so we got oh we got I'm gonna do Irvine uh Irvine okay and and the last thing is I want if you I want you to either write JavaScript or typescript depending on what your preference is so I've got purple Irvine and I'm looking for either a JavaScript or a typescript let's see I'm not gonna I'm not going to pick I'm not going to do you Alex I'm going to wait for someone else uh all right all right typescript I'm gonna go with I'm gonna go with typescript all right so I know folks are probably wondering Carter why are you doing this this is insane what does this have to do with Raffles uh I'm going to do this really really fast and I hope you all think it's fun um so I'm G to go back and share my screen again all right so my my screen is being shared um I'm going to switch over to an app that the app that I built on uh on next by the way and deployed on versel for the raffle and I've got a script uh called winner. MJS that I'm going to use to create a effectively randomized Vector embedding um and look it's random you all just gave me a bunch of information that I couldn't have predicted right so uh scripts winner. MJS uh and I'm going to enter in these values so purple uh Irvine California and typescript and what this is going to do is this is going to use open Ai and this particular embedding model to create a a random vector and there we go there's my random Vector um there's no way that any of you could have gamed the system uh for this raffle I feel pretty confident about that so Carter what are you gonna do with the raffle no problem I'm going to show you that right now so going back to Astra I showed you how you can use Astra to to view data in your database um but you can also do something really awesome called Vector search so I'm going to show you exactly how that works so we're going to go to the versell live stream raffle uh and we're going to go to the data Explorer and all of all of the people who entered the raffle um are documents in my Vector store and I am going to go ahead and basically do it and and and and sorry as as your records were being inserted uh there were uh there were Vector embeddings created for all of you in your documents so I'm going to go ahead and apply this Vector search and whoever shows up uh at the top of the list um for Vector similarity is going to win is gonna win this camera um assuming that it's a valid name and valid email address so three two one go all right so uh uran Ansari you are the winner um so congratulations uh I hope I hope you're super excited about this we will reach out to you uh with uh your shipping information um but yeah I'm gonna go ahead and stop sharing my screen but that was uh that is a very very quick and abbreviated way of picking a random winner for the raffle um so thanks so much for everyone who entered and iron we are going to reach out and contact with you and hook you up um okay so uh we've gotten through that um we are we're almost entirely out of time um I'm we just had way too much fun uh you know diving into the versel aist SDK and all this stuff um very very quickly um I know we had a lot of questions in the Q&A um and I want to try to go through um just a just a couple of them um and and Michael these are mostly for you um just very very but very quickly um is there is the versel AIS SDK something that like python developers can use because I I I know that versel um uh that you can deploy P some python apps to versel like is that something that that that exists or is in the works um it's it's definitely things that that we're discussing right now obviously you you know that verell and nextjs obviously Embraces react and that's kind of like our first stop on on the bus as well but um there's there's things coming that that will set up the foundational layers for um other Technologies to sit on on top of this um so I would just say more to come yes we are thinking about it um just nothing that I have to like gift you all uh today yeah no no worries and like and and sticking to the to the sort of full stack JavaScript Universe um does the versel aisk work with like other other Frameworks should that that people should know about yeah I mean so again there's nothing special that's that's really happening that is like nextjs specific right like you're you're you can use the AIS SDK to in other in other JavaScript Technologies you know even spelt as well to you I know we have some examples out there they're using some AISD as well but um when you're talking about like the generative UI type type stuff again that's kind of the the the foundational layers there is react server components so you would have to be using something that understands react server components nextjs you know has that imple implemented and and it knows how to use it but as other Frameworks and whatnot start adopting react server components as well too um then they would be able to take advantage of those things as well okay that's that's awesome then and I think there were several questions um about like what you know just um like is I mean based on like what you showed um is this sort of free uh for is there sort of a there's a free tier that developers can use like on versell to do everything that you s that you show off right yeah I when I especially when I try to do um demos and even talk through things here as well too I I want to stay out of you know Enterprise accounts and out of pro accounts like I want to show something that everybody can do and take advantage of and so it this is a great question because we need to peel back a couple of different layers here right like all the things that I were showing you you know as far as like in the code editor is obvious all all free right like nextjs is free um you know and and when we we're showing things and the versell AI SDK is free I mean there's nothing that's that's gatekeeping you from a cost perspective there everything I showed you in versell was all on the hobby account which is our lowest tier you're not paying you know anything there so like I mentioned even during the stream uh there isn't an endless amount of like free things that you can try inside of um you know like an AI Integrations page otherwise you wouldn't need to go to like chat gbt and whatnot you could just keep using brell for free um so there's a limited number there usually it's like around 10 tries or so that they give you enough of an indication of hey this is a tool I'm interested in um and I would like to integrate with um and then beyond that the the cost is more of a Downstream type of cost right like you can you can I could deploy and launch everything that I that I built inside of vs code today out on a hobby for sale for free and it would be just fine um but when you're integrating you may have briefly saw it when I pulled up like hey I want to integrate with llama right and it said okay great you can use these three providers right replicate for you know and a few others and then it showed like you can do this many interactions for this kind of cost right so there is a downstream cost for integrating to some of these other providers uh you know directly even with like open Ai and whatnot um you might have to pay for credits Downstream from there but you you should be able to do a decent amount for free um for quite a while yeah no it sounds awesome um just yeah I just want to for sure like I mean building these applications require like generally requires stitching together a lot of different services so I think all the developers out there kind of generally understand that and then just a question of like hey of these services that you're stitching together you know which ones are free which ones require payment um and uh you know and and also you know speaking in terms of like these embedding models these llms like there's definitely an opportunity for developers to use like open source models and and see what's out there um and hugging face is a fantastic resource for doing that so yeah hug hugging face is available inside of Rell as well too so there you go yeah awesome yeah fantastic so uh look I we were we're over over time this is just so much fun Michael I just wanted to thank you so much um for joining us we've been looking forward to the stream for a while um I hope that everyone enjoyed it uh and learned something um people have asked repeatedly um is this session being recorded yes it's being recorded it's going to be posted to YouTube it's going to be available here on crowdcast um so for you know for folks you know friends and colleagues that weren't able to attend don't worry it's going to be here um and yeah so just once again thanks so much for coming everyone um who's watching um thanks so much for tuning in um we're gonna we're gonna keep doing these things they're just too much fun um and we will see you all next time for the next stream so uh take care folks bye-bye",
