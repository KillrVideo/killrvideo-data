    "text": "so hi we are back here at data stack secular accelerate in DC and I'm with these two gentlemen a technical expert from the last pickle Joe a dad and Alex on the jet ski from data stacks this is the distributed data show would you please introduce yourself to the audience sure so I'm John Haddad I'm a former data stacks alum and I've been with the last pickle for three years I'm the principal consultant over there I'm also committer and PMC member hi I'm addicts so I'm a consultant at the last pickle I've been there for the past three years as well and I maintainer of Cassandra Reaper which is a tool that allows to repair clusters okay thank you so I know it's pretty early on the alpha day but how do you like the conference so far and why did you came at the first place so it's good to be back at a dedicated Cassandra conference I've been to a bunch of other conferences and you definitely don't get the same energy that you get when you have a topic a single topic at a conference so it's really us and be back and that a lot of people come up to the booth finally the last pickle we have our first booth ever at a conference kind of exciting yup and it's the this is the first pickle booth hopefully not the last and yeah it's been it's been awesome a lot of cool people have come up to us and had a lot of good conversations already yeah a good thing is that it allows us you have some feedback like when you maintain an open source tool you don't know how many people use it if they enjoy it like you have issues on github and stuff like this but then we can connect with people that use our tools and it's a good thing yeah like John said it's been what three years since we had the last Cassandra summit so it's good to have again a ring of the of their community yes and it's quite a small community everybody knows each other it's good together everyone at the same place and we chat a lot with those people were on amazing it's just see somebody put a face on my name yeah okay so not only you will be at the booth all day long but your so we'll have some talk both of you so would you have to get something gets about what you will speak about sure Ramsey you want to go ahead so go for it okay I'm alright I'll go first so the first talk well actually I'll have the second talk my talks tomorrow at 11:40 and I'm gonna be talking the title of the talk is 10 easy ways to tune your Cassandra cluster we've done a lot of cluster tuning at TLP definitely touched at least 100 clusters by now just me and everyone else has done the same and worked on a variety of clusters so we've pretty much seen all sorts of stuff and managed to find 10 just quick wins that can you know double triple the performance of your cluster and they're really really easy to do so hopefully everybody everybody that comes to the talk gets something out of it I kind of put something in there for everybody and definitely looking forward to sharing that so I'm gonna be talking about repair and more specifically specifically sorry improvements in incremental repair that are coming in Cassandra for daro so repair incremental repair kinda works in current versions but there are some caveats that can harm classes it's been totally revamped in Cassandra 4 and we've been testing it and it works fine so I'm just gonna explain what are the changes and what you can expect from repairs in Cassandra for all right thank you very much so um I read your blog post it's awesome very deep dive very technicals but what are you doing guys when you're not ask us tomorrow during blog post or doing some talk at the co fans what's happening at TLP right now yeah we try to maintain those tools so we have a set of tools that we distribute on github so there's TLP clustered TLP stress which is a replacement for Cassandra stress we also have Reaper we contribute to another tool called sea star which is a tool from Spotify that allows to run cluster wide commands in a topology aware fashion and so either we help customers write blog posts go to conference or right tools and John here is also a commentary on the casino project the Apache Cassandra projects I guess he merges PR yeah right right now we're also spending a little bit more time trying to help get 4'o out so that as Alex mentioned the tools that we have are used to provision clusters and to put do load testing on clusters and they're built in a way that is less configuration based and more about running stress workloads that are pre-configured so that you don't have to worry about writing a yamo yourself so it's a lot easier to use and you can basically just get up and running so we've been bringing up clusters hammering them and then getting feedback to everybody that's that's committing the most code to it and you know we're really trying to get this helped get this thing out as soon as possible okay so we far understand well the performance test you will run the first test on a note something like that and based on the response time and the ad where the disk around the memory you will update and we will update the casts on how the general find right it's a little bit so it's a little bit more complicated in that we're trying to push we're trying to push these machines to see where they fail not necessarily to see what they're capable I'm under the right conditions so the the things that we're trying to prove work are things like the new back pressure mechanisms that are going to make sure that if a cluster gets overloaded it won't just oh em and die it will correctly handle the additional load shed it away and then stay we reach a stable point and the idea here is that you know if Cassandra's gonna be always on we can't have it just crashing because it's om ome and there was a major major rewrite done in 402 the the inner node communication and now it's yeah exactly now it's gonna be based on Nettie instead of the old RPC mechanism and it's a huge change and and there's a lot of people that need to take a look at it and test it out and that's that's one of the reasons why I wrote the tools that I started working on so we're you know we're hopefully more people can contribute because the tools are more readily available okay so as cometa of Apache Cassandra may be a recurring question but what is your bet for the date of the release oh god I would love to see it out in let's say August we do we also have a the the Apache con conference where we have Cassandra tracks and those have gotten way more submissions than we ever thought would actually happen and so it'd be really really awesome if we could get Cassandra four out before that conference and really get the word out and get people using it and I think I think it's I think it's getting there I think it's it looks the testing that we've done generally speaking looks pretty stable we're still finding bugs but we really want this to be the best release of of Cassandra to date this is also what Jonathan Ellis used to say is just we it will be released when it will be ready just rock solid and yeah exactly that that's the that's the that's really kind of the goal here is that we want to be able to recommend Cassandra for two people the day that it's released and we want to get past it's kind of the historical issues that have kind of plagued the project of occasionally you know you'll you'll hear people say don't use it for six months or six bug-fix releases we want to put that to bed like that that I want to see that that idea died with Cassandra for nice okay so thank you very much maybe find out what final idea about today or if not so I am I final idea that's a tough one I wasn't prepared for this ya know I think I mean the final idea is really want to circle back to what I said before it's really great to have another conference that's just so focused on one topic where I get to talk to people about the thing that they're passionate about and meet so many people that yeah oh yeah yeah means just meet so many people that you know know us and have worked with us and we've helped through our blog and the tools that we write anything no happy to be there as well eager to see Cassandra for coming out maybe we can like call people to action can they help like the community in trying to stabilize we're gonna reach out you have something on freenode right Cassandra channel on freenode and there's a Cassandra dev channel on freenode also the Cassandra dev mailing list so if you're if you're interested in helping out and you want to know more about how to help definitely ask on Cassandra Devyn either on the mailing list or on IRC we can point you in the right direction okay so thank you very much for being with us today and maybe see you later thank you thank you",
