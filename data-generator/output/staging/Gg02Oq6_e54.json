hello hello can you hear us can you see us please give us a thumb up in the in the chat just you know audio check and if it's okay we will start can you hear us hello hi animesh hi bridget hello hello hello yes okay i think we are good okay all right yeah so thank you for the for the audio check daigo we we never know you know even if we if we asked it's not easy to to know okay so welcome everyone for these two hours workshop starting a four weeks boot camp to make you a pretty skillful in uh no sequel and apache somehow this week is really introduction to no sequel and apache cassandra and you will see what's coming in the next week so these content is provided to you by the data stacks developer advocate crew that you can see on screen some of us are in with you in the chat right now answering your question and uh stefano and me are on screen so let us introduce ourselves uh i will go first and slide first sorry stephanie yes um so i'm leading this team of developer advocates i'm i do have a java background i created an open source framework and i do everything i can to bring some awareness around the cassandra technology and more and i'm also writing the software development kit to use a tool we will use today for the enzo practice called astra you do have my coordinates don't hesitate to invite me on nicky din would be happy to have you in my network and with me stefano yes hi everyone i'm stefano um yeah i am a developer advocate at data stocks with cedric and with all the other guys you've seen in the previous slide um yes for me the same so please feel free to connect with me that would be great i am mostly a developer with a change of a data architect and i like and i know apache cassandra my background is in python and javascript and i have a background in computational physics which led me to get interested and love distributed systems in particular cassandra which is a wonderful technology and i love to teach i've been a teacher in schools in universities and whatnot i'm also a scuba diver teacher by the way and i like to communicate so here i am hi alex i see alex in the chat nice yeah alex alex with us in the chat hello alex so today um six parts uh introducing how the boot camp and this workshop works uh doing a theory introduction to nosql database what are there go to introduction to cassandra what is the cap telegram more about cassandra table and partition you will do some uh exercises practice uh a little bit during the session and way more over the week as homework but you know do not worry i will explain you in detail what it is so here you do have the full pictures everything is available for you on github as well again we will give you all the links so i keep talking about four weeks boot camp so quickly it's the first week beginning of the year so we wanted to give you some content to uh learn more about cassandra and be able to take the certification after a month of training uh some hands-on session every week and some personal work to do after the session so week one today uh is today is the second session we had the same content yesterday at the um north america time zone friendly so this session is more dedicated for people in eme and apac so two hour live session and covering introduction to nosql and cassandra okay next week focus into cassandra data model a feature for real application real world application full stack application as you can see week three okay week three we start coding we take the drivers and do some exercises with java python and javascript to interact with this database because now after two weeks you know what it does you know how to use it and week four on top of this small sample code you did with three we will create real backend real full stack backend using uh express jungle and spring boot uh again java javascript python okay so a lot of learning teaching and coding so hope you will enjoy the ride we are together for uh one month even if you know each session is standalone so if uh you want to tell your friend now is a good time to you know start embracing this session after the four weeks we will give you some voucher to be able to pass the certification for free okay okay so how does it work uh pretty easy just stay with us for the two hours uh for the live stream workshop wednesday or thursday okay we are live on youtube and also on twitch we answer your question live on youtube you will see that uh yes it's the first class we answer your question on youtube uh and also we have a discord room because when the stream is ended you may want to ask questions and we will be on discord all week long all week long to answer your question it's an interactive session okay it's just not uh two ads talking on screen uh we will do some practice we will also play some games and uh first game will be pretty soon uh we will answer question you live and you know with your phone you can give your answer and it will show up on screen and we use something called mentee to do that so very soon we will ask you to open a new tab or use your phone and go to a website to play with us that's the live session so they're going to complete the workshop labs we will do some exercises together uh part of the exercises will be demo just to to to stay in the two hours um and as your personal work you will have to finish those labs first step so to do the labs you won't have anything to install we do have the database cassandra ready for you we do have an ide of course you can still use your own id loca you know on your local machine um vs code eclipse uh intellij whatever but for the live we will uh you know invite you to use git pod id because there is nothing to install and it's hard for us to debug you during the live session you will see also some katakuda full-fledged environment to to learn new new part of the database all the materials exercises courses code slides all are on github and we will give you the link by the way you see we have a bots on the youtube chat right now so if you do bang exclamation mark github you get the link of github exclamation mark astra you get the link for astra exclamation mark um mentee you get the the how to connect mentee to play the game with us so then learning materials okay to be ready for the certification two hours is not enough we will give you the key but then you will need to take a free online courses during over the week just to get more in deep with the technology okay again nothing to install we have some dedicated website academy that that's dev or still github okay and week four after each week like every uh boot camp or course you have may done in the past we would like to check that you do have the knowledge and we will give you a google form to validate your week uh okay you don't need to be specially on time you can catch up later but you know better to to stay on time when you complete the week we grant you a badge as you can see here badges one badges for each week and a big badges kind of certificate at the end of the bootcamp okay but here the target is to build you some skill skills and also make you uh you know skillful to pass the certification in the end that our two goals okay and with that i think we can start the interactivity just to to try for the first time a mentee so now what i will ask you is to go to when to open a new tab in your uh brother go to mentee.com and uh use the code that we will give you yes please so let me ask nightbot to give us the code and switch to my screen um yes and there we go okay so um we are about to ask you to join menti so you can do that from your phone or just another tab in your browser and what is meant is basically a platform to ask you questions interactively i've seen i see someone is already joining so welcome welcome you go to mendy.com and use the code that you've seen here in the chat and you see also on my screen you see there is also a way to join it with by scanning a qr code so we are about to ask you some questions oh wait i'm hiding the number so i'll be temporarily invisible for you to see the code um you can still hear my voice around so um you know we want to get to know better so we want to know what kind of developers you are and what are your interests so we will be asking you a few questions to know you better so let me go back to the menu screen in the meantime and this is also a way to get you connected with mendy because please when this initial survey is over uh please keep the connection open to mendy because by the end of today's session there will be a quiz with questions for you and for those questions if you answer fast you will be you will have a chance to win some nice prizes some nice swag so please i see i see 30 something already joined menti so yeah and you know what uh stefano we are almost 100 on uh youtube yeah so we wait a little more so please jump on mendy.com use the code you see and in a while we will start so yeah yeah it's the first time maybe you you deals with mentees so least let's give one me yeah sorry to go so yeah again yeah again the code is always at the very top of the screen you know and i keep posting the code as well in the chat yes so let's give let's give another minute or so so okay so we are now about to ask you a few questions just to know you better but later on please don't forget that you you will have to you will have a chance to win some some prizes by answering questions about what you learned today yeah so we passed again the 51 mark so nice maybe we can start okay let's do it okay by the way please do not answer in the youtube chat because those would be wasted answers unfortunately and that's even more important later when we get to the quiz yeah you want your answer to be on screen so yeah take the time open new mentee.com new tab enter the code and you will see something that you answer will be on screen with us live okay so let's see we are about 60 so we can start and before starting with the quiz let's ask you a few questions to get to know you better first where are you watching us from where are you connecting from you don't need to be extremely accurate we just want to have an idea so so yeah this station is meant to be uh in in apac and see it seems to to to work yes it seems so even though i see someone from the u.s as well hello europe india indian asean australia is that portugal france germany maybe russia sweden russia look at that it's so distributed like database we will cover today yes that would make for a great distribution yeah and more more people in india uh in the chat uh yeah so you know please use many uh oh look at that in the middle of asia uh yeah i would yeah i will not even try to to to to give the name of the the country here there are so many in this small region right now but it's great for the world okay okay i see oh wow great okay so let's move on next question have you been to any of our workshops before this one so and we asking the question because we are live every week or almost two years uh twice a week most of the time so we have i don't know 100 workshop or something and it's it's always the same format you have two speakers and it's all interactive we are covering a lot of topic uh but you know you can have a look in our youtube channel to go back in time and see what ev everything we cover but you know all the main java javascript python frameworks architecture a lot but you know do not talk too much about that you will learn more in these four weeks to come oh yeah definitely so i see many of you are newcomers welcome it's great to see you and um yeah so we hope you will like it and next question do you have experience with nosql databases never used it some experience a lot of experience or are you really a master of nosql oh i see we have a master congratulations but you will learn something anyway because there is always something to learn so but yeah overall i see most of you have little to no experience with nosql databases that's perfectly fine exactly what we expect for this session we are going going back to the beginning yeah we will start from the beginning so no particular previous knowledge required which is great so welcome everyone and i see most answers i think have come in so let's move to the next question which is no question so i'm sorry that was the end of it okay three small questions indeed in the beginning uh yeah just just for everybody to get used into this mentee also for us to know um if you you know where where are you located and if we are at the good time zone and to improve over time okay so again i will not close this mentee and you should not you should do the same so keep it open because later it will be very useful if you want to play with in the quiz and maybe win some prizes and with that thank you for the answers and uh let me give it back to you cedric is that okay ready i'm ready i'm ready i think we we are 80 million 18 minutes in and we have covered all the housekeeping you play a little game so you are all set for this session now time to for content right time to start yes and with that let's start yeah let's see yeah okay all right let's go so intro to no sequel here we go uh why no sequel was invented you can ask the question because rational database like mysql postgre oracle dominated the database market for decades so why why did it change okay what do you think what are you what do you see something that some database like uh cassandra mongodb redis elastic why more and more no sql databases let's go into it and you know even going into it i would like just just to mention no sql means not only sql so it's not one against against the other because i know i know we will get the question okay so let's dig into what is no secret well the issue with relational database where it was not really to cope with the new volume of data there has been they have been designed to be installed on a single machine single single server and it's not easy to scale so at some point you do have too many data to be stored on the single machine and also if you have a terabyte of data a relational database tends to be slower and slower so you need to have to do something about volume second is velocity okay so relational determine rdbms to make short can only do i don't know a couple of thousand transactions per second that's the that the limit when i used to administrate an oracle database uh we told that you know above four thousand transactions per second it was a bit hard and it was a lot of customers customization to make it work but in the reality right now we need some database that can do some millions of written writes per second right so a by default rdbms are not good enough third is the variety we used to put only tables and and joins in in in the database but now you want to put many type of data schema-less document graph relational entities some raw object you know big data or story is all about uh un unformalized data with no schema stuff like that so volume variety velocity this is what we call the 3v are the reason why you can kind of limited with rd ms also if you look at the volume of data that will come over the year to come see 20 22 3 4 5 we will go to 175 zeta byte of data i think that's uh you know zeta is like 10 to the power 21 the just crazy amount of data to store now and of course we will need some some tools that can cope with so many data so much data um oltp olap otp means online transaction processing it is everything that is real time i read and write in real time simple queries this is one way to use uh sql and request right olap means online analytical processing those are used more in data warehouse the query could take minutes the use case are do some aggregation computation at the end of the day to know everything will happen it does not to be super fast uh it's more computation intensive that's uh read writes and so when people design relational database rdbms they have to to make some trade-off to be good in both oltp and olap okay so ltp traditional three normal form data model olap is more data warehouse what we call and more like um you know snowflake uh snowflake data model or you know that data mart or more about the normalization and you know because it's a trade-off you you cannot go strong on otp stronghold olap and so some nosql database are here to help in one case or another so relational database on the left part any database that supports sql so relational database sql rdbms are the same okay and not only sql cover a wide range of technology variety velocity so document database maybe this is the one you have heard about mongodb elastic you want to save json okay key value redis dynamo memcache everything that is distributed cache okay tabular database this is the one we will cover today with cassandra and over the the the weeks to come uh this is the one we will focus on tabular database okay ledger database so um more like uh even storming happened only so qldb ksqldb um you know happen only more you know used to keep the track of everything that happened on the database you only add mutation mutation mutation and at any point of time you can see everything that happened in your with your record time series oh huge time series database influx upon tsd promoters and graph database like neo4j graph data stacks graph if you have your data set highly connected uh titan as well so we won't go into too many details of these six flavors of database on this channel we have some uh workshop uh two hours three hours long to have some hands-on with each one of those but for the boot camp okay now we will focus on tabular database and and i would like to know it's not one against the other there is no one which is better than the other it's always based on your use case okay easier use case read intensive write intensive what is your data format what is the way you would like to query the data how much volume do you want to keep those are the questions you need to ask and you will see okay maybe this database or the others is better and when you pick the uh flavor of database let's say tabula database okay yeah then only then you can do some uh analysis to see hey is cassandra based big table better for for for my company start doing some some poc pov but you know picking one flavor of nosql database against another should be more based on your use case and constraint you should you should know which one okay so now let's move to uh cassandra tabular databases okay and cassandra is used uh by company by the fam okay by huge company and especially netflix and apple so we had a chance to have the tech lead of netflix on this very youtube channel that shares some numbers with us stating that 98 of streaming data is storing apache cassandra netflix netflix have some active cluster so a cluster is a database installation with multiple machines okay so netflix have some some cluster with thousands and of nodes okay and a whopping 30 per second that's just crazy 500 terabytes and you a lot a lot of cpus that's just crazy and at april look at that 160k apache cassandra instances and it was into 18 so 100 petabyte store and same seven millions a percent per second so the biggest strength of cassandra and you will see that is that it's scale as much as you as you need as much as you want and you know apple is not even the biggest uh cassandra user on the planet for a long time we we think it was the case but now we know that we have the the the biggest company in china that are even bigger than that you know and you know who i'm talking about always the four semi in china okay so apache cassandra is a nosql distributed decentralized database it's big data ready it's designed for read and write performance especially right performance it does in what we call linear scalability if you need more node uh if you need more capacity to put a node high availability you will see you have multiple machines in your cluster you can lose any machine it's not a big deal the system is still available there is no failure and if the node come back itself self-healing geographical distribution performance wonder independent but i do have a slide for each one of those by the way we told you the slides are on the github repo so you can keep uh you can keep them okay so what you see on the right part is how we represent an installation of cassandra living on multiple uh machine okay this is what we call a ring or a data center and each dot is a server an installation okay and so when you install cassandra in circus around multiple machines i i told you that and each machine each server is in charge of a subpart of the data this is what we call partitioning so partitioning of our distributed architecture make the database capable to under any size okay so on one node rule of thumb in my head one terabyte of data per node so if you need more capacity simply add new node second is master less so here there is no master no slave uh you can lose any of the node if all the nodes are even and you can read and write from every node okay we will come back more into these um consistency stuff later but what you need to understand is every node is equal in cassandra and could do read and write and no master okay we told you about uh linear ability if you don't believe us that's a benchmark from netflix and see how it behave uh by the way cassandra is apache cassandra apache to license it's free and open source okay so you see i'm pretty uh advocating focus it's super strong but hey it's free okay um in the cassandra cluster you can have one ring you can also have multiple rings you install ring on different location it's geography distributed you can read and write from anywhere and the data will be replicated for you so replication dysfunctionalization are done at cassandra level there is no single poll of failure and you in your application the driver you use is super intelligent if you send him some if you send some data through the driver the driver will know where to go and where to put the data we will explain you more how the data is distributing distributed among these nodes or among these machines okay you might ask the question hey where do i know my data leave i will explain that to you in a couple of minutes okay that's all the the for now it's really the concept and the uh architecture with so many machines so many you know so many machines sometimes it could be hard to to manage right it should be automate as much as possible uh but fortunately cassandra helps you with this scaling you add nodes and cassandra will redistribute the data for you and if node is down the system is still working because your data live on multiple machine multiple node data is replicated okay and if the node is back the system will self-heal automatically that's cool right probably cooler than this uh a creepy and spooky gif okay um so if you install a casino right cluster trademark deploy on multiple data center multiple rings that's pretty convenient you know for for instance legal reason if you're living in germany you like your data to live in germany uh and same for french china and a lot of laws and regulation ask you to have your data locally at the same time you can have some public data available across the world they are all alive it's active active architecture there is no you know a primary secondary no no no no every node every dc is active anytime what you can have in geographic distribution you can do the same with technical distribution why not having a ring on each cloud provider and make them part of the same cluster totally doable now we are technical not not marketing it's not magic you still need to open the network route in between the cloud providers um there are some dedicated companies that do that like aviatrix for instance uh you can also open some mpls lines in between your cloud but hey technically speaking cassandra could be a platform platform as not as nasty agnostic a single technology available across the cloud providers okay so cassandra is not bound to any platform no locking pretty cool right so no locking scale distributed replicated pretty cool and cassandra is part of the apache foundation and you know so there is no chance that cassandra changed the the license you know anytime soon making more closed source or something like that it's a non-profit open source foundation and it's uh super active we have cassandra 4.0 has been released last year and since then we have seen some great energy in the community uh great stuff are coming uh in the project right now okay hope it looks cool you know and it was only you know 15 minutes hey all the promises of afghanistan uh how does it work a lot of promise and uh do not really read the chat right now but probably sure you have your head fill of questions so let's dig into how does cassandra works okay so first all servers are created equals on the holy book love this quote alex love this quote okay so what master less mean in previous i mean relational database works like that some no sql database works like that then you have a leader or master and follower called slave the way it works you can only write on the master or leader and it's a single part of failure and you write on the single place just you to be sure about the consistency and then the data is replicated on the follower and with this kind of architecture tradition architecture you immediately realize that it could be good for read you can you you can add as many followers as you need to to to be able to read a lot to be web scale as some some company like to say but for right it's not good because you do have a single point of failure and this is your leader and we told you that because we've cast on how every node is equal there is no point of failure okay you can read and write from any node it's a peer-to-peer architecture and you can contact any node okay first important things to remind you peer-to-peer no master just saying could be useful for the question and game at the end second data is replicated so this is your data center this is your ring and i told you okay um [Music] the the same row the same data is available on multiple node it's replicated it's called the replication factor and the idea is if you load if you lose any of the node not a big deal because the same data is still available somewhere else that's the point so when you create a database and something called a key space we will see that later what it is you design how many time does your data is copy so here it's just a sample we create a key space in a cassandra with two data centers two rings if you want the first ring is called us west one in there i will have a replication factor of three and on the second one i will have a replication factor of five it's by data center okay some data center would like to have a higher replication rate because maybe they are hostile and you do have more chance to lose any node but recommended number is three sometimes you go up to five but it does not really make sense to go above five because then you have a lot of this a lot of time the same data that took in space on disk okay if the replication factor is one then uh your data leave on the single node here if now i update to two the data same data is on two nodes okay you got the id and three the same data is on three nodes and so if i lose a node no big deal i still have two and i can read from them and the i told you the driver the way you connect to the database is clever enough to if i try one node and it's not working at the driver level it will retry and contact a second node with the same data you your application won't even notice that you add a miss data is distributed so this one is very very important again now i put my data center or rings always using two terms on the left part in cassandra you will store tables in this table you will have a very very important column or set of columns could be a set of columns and it's called the partition key based on the value in the partition key the data will be stored on different nodes like that okay so even a single small table like that will be distributed among all the nodes like that based on the value of the partition key each node will have multiple partition of course but all the rows with the same partition key will be stored at the same node you store together what you want to retrieve together now a node could have multiple partition here you see a single row partition and a second single row partition okay with this slide you can say oh wow so if i do select star for my table it's not a good idea even if the table is small because cassandra needs to fetch some pieces of the data of on every single node this is what we call a full scan cluster and you really want to avoid that so data is distributed maybe you ask the question how the data is distributed so now again when you create it's not again first time we see this statement when you create a table now you will design what is your primary key primary key is there to ensure your unicity and inside the primary key you get the partition key so partition key is only a part of your primary key and partition key alone does not ensure unicity of your record you can see that the same multiple records have the same partitioning key okay why partitioning i mean you you say hey why should i distribute my my data among multiple nodes well i told you already with so many data it will take forever to uh you know screen data on the single machine uh it will take you know super long and eventually you won't get any space left or any big enough uh hard disk drive to store that many data and that's pretty risky as well so as you can see netflix apple make the choice to have hundreds and hundreds of small server it's behave better and you know if you if you have heard about kubernetes a bit you know a way to deploy some some software nowadays is the same logic working with small uh system small pods and if you want to add power to your system you scale out you add more nodes and you don't add capacity to your machine okay so how the data is distributed you know um i show you these uh schema and say hey okay um but how do i know that usa should be on the node on the top how do i know that fair should be on on the second node and so forth and so on well we do have something called a partitioner and it's using a free algorithm called mir mir 3 but you can change the algorithm if you want so it will hash the value of the partition key it will give you a number an integer between 1 and 2 to the power 64. and this number is called a token okay so each time you want to write something in cassandra cassandra will take the value of the partition key will hash the value and get an integer and then each node is in charge of a range of the token it's like doing a modulo so i do have the integer and now i know uh the range and i can contact the proper node and save my data in the proper node so this is why we could represent the cassandra node with its token range so here instead of going from 1 to the power 2 2 to the power 64. it's too big for the slides to come let's pretend that on a table you can have 100 record and i will do my token range between 1 and 100. so if i do have four nodes it's easy 25 on each node right uh as just stated if i now add a new node scaling out add a new node to my machine then the token range are recalculated okay and now this is the new allocation of my token range uh so cassandra will do the work for you live with no downtime so if you can see the first node now is in only charge of 1 to 20 so anything from 20 to 25 should be moved to the second so there will be streaming in between known one and win2 to copy the the the part of the data that need to be copied but the data from 20 to 25 on node 1 will be decommissioned deleted only when all the replication are done and so as a consequence there is absolutely no downtime and this is why you can scale out with no downtime or you can scale in uh or you know is that you know you can scale down if you want now if scale down may be better than scaling if you scale down now you scale down to three nodes and the token range again are redistributed scaled down could be um could be tricky you need to be sure that uh your smaller number of nodes can handle the the volume you know i told you in between one and two terabyte of data per node so scaled down could be uh you know it's not something you do very very frequently but totally doable with casserole that is distributed now if on top of distribution i add the replication factor okay so four nodes this is how the data is distributed okay if i had the replication factor now that mean the same node is in charge of two token range one to 24 eventually as well 26 to 50. it's it's of course it's not consecutive token range here just to be as simple as possible but now you need to understand that if you increase the replication factor then the talk the same token range like 2650 is available on two node so 26 to 50 is available on node one and also on the two and if i want to put some colors in the the cluster this is what it looked like okay so if this guy is in charge of 0 to 16 17 to 20 to 33 6 node dc the data in this token range is available here here and here for the replication factor 3. okay so hope it's clear data is replicated data is distributed this way so now what if you want to save data there how does it work the data come the partition key is usa usa is hashed using the murmur 3 algorithm you get an integer this integer is what we call the token here token is 59 you can contact any of the node even if the node in is not in charge of 59 look at that this node in blue has nothing to do with the the 59 59 is not part of the token range handled by this node not a big deal the node will simply send the data to the three replica the one in charge of this data boom now your data will be in the proper node and so for this request node here called 17 is what we called the coordinator node it's not a master it's not a leader it's a coordinate or law node and the coordinator node will change for every single request you make it's a coordinator load for the request and that's it okay so each cassandra node and the cassandra drivers is aware of the the token distribution so what you just seen before like somebody writing node to you know writing some data to a node not in chart of 59 could not really happen in reality the driver is clever so he will send the data to one of the replica in charge of the data just for the request to be as fast as possible that is distributed globally i've seen that we have seen that in the in the slide just before so geography and ibra cloud okay almost done with the theory after chapter four you could really start you know creating your first instance uh and in doing so first first uh queries against against that instance so far so good stefano do we have any uh leftover question or are we good well there are very interesting questions in the chat about how replication works what are tokens but i think uh alex and and i are doing a great job at answering them okay there is so there has been a question that will probably be answered by what you are going to speak next namely uh whether replication would cause any redundancy during access and i think you will soon speak of consistency levels and that's yes will be a great answer so go ahead okay nice yeah um great question by the way yeah thank you for the question it's it's all about interactivity okay what is the biggest problem of replication or you might already know right if the same data live on two nodes how do we know that they are already in sync how can you be sure that one data is not in advance you know it's it's it's not in the future and the other in the past okay you could have potential potential inconsistency so the new value here um let's say is 13. and the three replica uh at the beginning of that are at 12 like you know um you want to update the value exactly as we have shown before you know pushing the new value to the three node and during that operation one node was not available so what will happen uh two nodes will be updated 13 12 because it has not been updated and now 13 and you do have some inconsistency inconsistency between the three nodes that could happen okay so how do we handle those use case well you do that by uh using what we call a consistency level so replication factor three we have seen that send the data if a node is down exactly as we have we have shown before well the value is saved at the coordinator level something called int the full mechanism is called intim onduff so as right now we do have an inconsistency because node in range did not get the new value and so the coordinator will save the data locally for three hours by default and when the node goes back online you know you restart the node of the network is back the database is self-healing because node 17 noticed that this guy is online and will push the data there okay now let's go to c a p theory so c a and p means for three features in distributed system it's very important to understand that that what i will told you is for distributed system having multiple server a for availability okay you can access your data c for consistency multiple machine having the same data are in sync are consistent and partition tolerance are issues that could happen in your network you lose in your system you lose the network in between the node you lose not cannot communicate one to each other so if the nodes are not able to communicate to each other how do you choose consistency availability well this is what we will see availability basement uptime okay you ask the question you get the answer no downtime even if you lose a node this time still available there are still node able to answer your request and this is exactly how cassandra works you have seen just before that if you lose one of the node you can still get the value because multiple multiple replica remain and the newest value is still there somewhere consistency that's the issue right oh at any point of time the three replica cannot be 100 in sync that's not a big deal cassandra has some uh way to cope with that and we will saw that in a minute and partition tolerance yeah as stated here it's the ability to survive network partitioning okay if your system is a master slave leader follower if you know bad luck your leader was uh on one side well on the other side now there is no leader so what uh database tends to do is elect a new leader then the network come back and all of a sudden you do have two leaders and this is what we call a split brain and you know we need to handle that fortunately with cassandra it's not the case okay so it's masterless and there is no need for master and so with that you you you can you can tell what cassandra is good at you know keep going the cap theorem also called eric brewer theorem tells you that in a distributed system you cannot have the three at the same time you need to choose if something goes wrong partition tolerance you need to make a choice you push for consistency or you push for availability if you push for consistency and want to to be sure that all the nodes are always in sync if a node is not there well you cannot write anymore in the database or read anymore in the database because the database will block you because otherwise the node will not be won't be consistent so those are the system called cp consistent partition terms and systems like kafka [Music] etcd are all cp now you can make another choice you can say okay uh i accept that my nodes are not all the time consistent but i want my system to be available and this is the choice that kassam has made as you see in the slide before the three replica may not be 100 consistent but the availability is there so this system is called ap availability partition tolerance so personhood is ap availability and partition tolerance but it's better than that cassandra is what you want cassandra to be when you read and write something in casama you will set something called the consistency level you will tell how many nodes do i want to contact to get my result and based on that you could have one answer the majority of the node as answer called corom or all the node to reply consistency all and based on the consistency level you choose for your request you will be mostly ap or mostly cp so let's see how it works so this is all the consistency level available won't go too much into the details so here let's pick an example b2b you know to be real to to to be very clear in my cluster i do have a replication factor of three the same that i live on three nodes okay and for this query i put the consistency level to one so the clients connect to any of the node not a big deal send the data in the three replica duplication factor three but we'll only wait for the first acknowledgement to say to the client okay that has been saved so this one is the fastest because it wait for single acknowledgement but for consistency it's not the best because you know that only one of the node got the latest version it will also uh happen on node two and three but you know maybe later the client did not wait for node 2 and 3 to have been updated second is a curve hey you want the majority of the node to be updated you know safer maybe a little a little longer but you know if the majority of the node is covered i feel better and that the recommended way okay you can also set a now i want to be safe i want all the node to be written get the acknowledgement of three nodes and now i'm sure that everybody is aware and get the notification great why not but then with this request you are consistent at all costs and if you lose any of these three nodes all of a sudden well your request will fail because the consistency all cannot be achieved um and it's not recommended in customer okay so maybe for very very critical queries you attempt to do so but you know instead of having consistency level all and be a cp system we can do better it's a trap so in the consistency level that really the most important slide you can ensure what we call immediate consistency how does it work you will write and you will read with comb the formula to remember it at the top of the screen the consistency level read plus consistency level right should be bigger than the replication factor how does it work let's try to be clear again as before client come and write the data okay asking for consistency level cohns data is sent to node one two and three okay client wait only for two acknowledgements let's say node one reply not to reply client is acknowledged and client does not wait for acknowledge like not free okay you got it now at the very same time of course it's always at the very some time same time it's consistency another client maybe we should we could call client two for the guy on the left part of the screen come and ask for a read and read with corom so read with coron means i would like the data coming from two nodes uh you know to be sure and this time okay instead of picking node one and two which is the the most up-to-date it would be too easy right the read decide to pick node one and node three oh all of a sudden we could have an issue because now we have two different value to send to the client and this is where cassandra have a rule we say the last right always win so only the most updated value will be sent to the client and if you read with chrome got the majority of the node read with coram got the majority of the node you can be sure matic matic mathematically proven that part of the replica when you read will get the latest update and the client will get the latest value of your data so pretty cool right even if at certain point of time not all the nodes are totally in sync you can uh read and write with data in sync that's the magic of uh eventual and immediate consistency okay it was a lot of theory it has been about an hour um i think we should now move to a little bit at enzo what do you think stefano yes very good so i think you have seen a lot and a lot of theory how cassandra works how data is distributed so maybe it's a good time to show you some hands to help you and and to see together some hands-on parts so for that let me first give you again the link to the github repo asking nightbot to give it let me first switch to my screen here and there we go there we go okay so you see now in the youtube chat there is a link to this very uh github repository i'm showing you now this contains all you need to refresh what you're seeing today and to maybe dig even um deeper and go to the practice part which is yeah require the part when you are serious about learning so yeah if you like me learn to like to learn by doing oh yes well practice is important right so uh okay so this is the repository and it comes with a very nice readme that explains uh everything so i will just show you quickly here you can find the slides you find instructions on on the lab to do but now let's jump right in the practice part and we start by uh creating our astra db instance so what does it mean um you have seen what astrodb is so astrodb is a database available in the cloud which means managed so you don't have to worry about you know maintenance and operations and it's uh ready for you to use up to a very generous free tier by the way so you get a free credit every month free credit every month to use it and that's not just to play with it but you are very much encouraged to use it for real let's say real life applications and uh yeah even even a small scale uh production application will probably fit into this limit which means millions of reads and quite several gigabytes of storage every month for free so to register to astra and create and start creating your database you please let me also make this here astro you click on this sign into astrodb maybe you can click it in a different in a new tab so you should get to a screen a screen uh where you can register so um that's completely free you can register with name email and password or with github or google please go ahead and register of course i already have an account so i will sign in with my existing account okay so in the meantime you will be registering here and you will be asked the questions such as um what is your primary programming language just give any answer you feel like giving and you should then get to a screen like this one which which is your astrodb dashboard so by the way all of these instructions are spelled out here in the readme so let's see register to astrodb choose start free now then you will be asked to create a new database which uh for example you can do with this big create database button now i'll i'm clicking on this create database button and there are a few questions there are a few fields to fill of course any database has a name and we encourage you to please do not be too creative and and for today just use the name we uh we suggest so i'll put it in the chat database name use workshops and keyspace name use chatsandra you find them in the youtube chat as well as in the readme here so please oh here i'm creating my database and i call it workshops and the key space i call chat sandra now we briefly mentioned that what is a key space a key space is a logical grouping within a database let's say it's a group of tables so usually when you are writing an application you want to keep all tables together you probably want to group them into a single key space so you might have a big database and within that database you can have several key spaces each one taking care of a particular part of a bigger application or even they might be related to different applications different services and whatnot now today we just create a key space called chatsandra why this name because today's example will be about a very simplified chat application so there will be a database hosting something such as users and posts by users so we call the key space chat sandra now yeah just yeah i'm pleased yeah i don't want to interrupt but just a remark yeah or today we are using chat sondra okay standalone sample for the weeks to come we will move to the to-do application you know i told you we will do code so now week two three four will be all about the to-do application uh but you know for now it's really focusing on how to handle cassandra and nothing else so yeah chapter chasse on high just the best for that yes so this is two days just to get some hands get get your hands dirty but yeah there is we don't have a real application behind this chat example but we have we do have a real application about the to-do application the to-do app so when it's when it will be about coding it will be the to-do application which is a full-fledged sample application we will work with in the next weeks but today just for the sake of example let me guide you through creating a creation of this database and key space so workshops chat sandra and then you see the cool thing is you can choose any cloud provider you prefer so there's a question about key space well don't mind that too much a key space is a group of tables so we will create tables in this database and we just put them into a key space let's say a bag of tables called chatsandra okay so you see you can choose any cloud provider you prefer so google cloud aws azure let me go for aws okay and it seems like okay so let me stay on google cloud for some reason i have regions that i'm not allowed to okay so let me go for google cloud and these so you choose a cloud provider an area in a region and you can then go for the create database button so let me recap that you are creating a database for today to play with and it will be the same database you will uh you will later use probably in the next weeks because workshops is the general name but today we are using a key space called chatsandra now you choose a cloud provider a region within an area and you click create database okay now it will take a few minutes let's say probably a couple of minutes and your database is being created you will see it here you see now i am back to my to my astrodb dashboard and what i see here is a workshop database and it is look here it is in the status pending let me make cedric and make ourselves a bit smaller for the sake of the demo and now we are so small okay here uh that should make it easier for folks there to help to to follow through you can now see yes we are very much smaller than we used to be yeah who cares we will go back to big when the demo when the practice is over so you see the database is in pending state and um i want to ask you guys to please give me a thumbs up if you manage to create your database and get it in pending state so while we wait for my and your database to get to to get ready we see if you manage to get to this point okay i see a thumbs up yeah nice bridgette mo you wink already what are we doing we are creating a database for uh llc mine has become active success already workshop database has become active very good okay so uh you are seeing we are creating a database that is then uh we okay i see thumbs ups great nice so oh yeah very good i mean that's cool that's cool this database will last for the weeks to come a lot of exercises to come with it yeah very good and let me stress you this is free so you can not only use it today for the demo or for the practice the exercises not only use it for the next weeks in the workshop but you can and you are invited to use it for your own experimentation to build your own wonderful applications and do whatever you want and if you manage to build something interesting please let us know because we are always very eager to know uh what uh what are you what you are doing with uh astrodb what kind of cool application you you're creating okay so i think we will give you your databases another minute or so to get to the ready state and so let me stress you that you will have no uh nothing to do except for using that database so operations creation of the database management the servers the database runs on the nodes it's all uh handled for you so it's fully managed you just create a db and start using it and playing with it yeah still pending but no problem it's probably going to become active in one minute or so um yeah so you can ask why it take a few minutes to start well when you start an instance you start a full three-node cassandra cluster so you need to start three machines and make them communicate to each other so this is why it could take two three minutes eventually yeah yes so no problem maybe let's yeah yeah so while we wait i'll start switching to the readme so you see what is coming next so we have a database we have a key space in this database that's all good and we will start creating tables so you have seen a create table uh statement in in the slides by cedric and that looked quite much similar to what you would write in sql for those familiar with that and i always like to say one thing don't be lulled into uh the sense that cassandra is similar to our on our relational database just because the language it uses it's similar to sql so cql it's the cassandra query language and it's specific to cassandra and yes it looks like sql but the underlying database is much different and many of the discussions we had today about data distribution and nosql and whatnot i hope they have been shedding some light on this point and probably uh next week with data modeling this will become even clearer so that being said let's start and create some tables yes you should be able to use china you should be able to use any cloud provider in any region in particular you might want to choose a region that is closer to you for latency reasons if you have any application in mind that might benefit from it but that's really not uh so important maybe for today practice yeah and you don't need any you know google adws or azure account yeah that's all platform that will create that for you and it's free i mean you may have seen that there is 25 credits written somewhere that represents about 40 million query amounts and it's really renew refreshed every month so even for small production and such it's it's still free so pretty cool and you hopefully you will realize it's a pretty powerful hour as well yeah so yes this 25 is what you get from for free every month to use is not what you have to pay of course and trust me it's not easy to use them up in one month especially if you're if you experiment and play with the database it's really impossible okay so today today's example is about a chat application called chatsandra and basically there are two kinds of things that are users and users post write posts in rooms chat rooms such as there is here the example gardening whatever okay so um there is a way to interact with uh cassandra and um in this case with astra database and that is the cql uh language and the cql console we mentioned that's by that's absolutely not the only way indeed if if and when you will be writing code you will be using drivers or you will be using other apis and you will probably not go by hand and write and write commands by hand in the console but today this is what we are going to do so let me go to astra again and you see i can click on my workshops database here you see this is my database that is become active i click on it and this is my this is the detail of my workshops database here so you see there are various tabs by the way there are there is a whole tab called connect that will list several ways to connect with it but today we concentrate on this one the cql console and what is this one and i'm clicking on it here the cql console is a very handy console just a text based console that is there for me in the browser you see and it makes me able to type commands and hitting enter to execute them exactly as any any text-based console so um and this will be today the main way we interact with astrodb okay so this is how you get to the console there is you click on your database and then you go to this sql console tab here and this is where we will we will write a few commands to to interact with the database okay so first thing we mentioned that um so i'm switching back and forth between the readme and the console and uh maybe let's keep this pretty me url again in the chat which might be useful so uh we mentioned that there are sever that that we will be using a particular key space called chatsandra and we will create tables within it so first i want to see which are the key space that are there so i might have my i have my database and there are some key spaces maybe so this is the command i have to use this is the command i have to use to show them so desk key spaces and then enter so every cql command should end with semicolon as you see here and desk spaces is a shortened form of described key spaces and we it will tell me what are the key spaces in this database you see our chat sandra is here and it's not the only one because well there are some other key spaces that are created for me and they are system purpose so that we are not concerned about them but the important thing is that chatsandra is there so from this point on i will tell the sql console please focus on chat sandra and every command i use i will type it's implied that it is working on chat sandra to do that i will just type use chat so when i type use chatsandra you see that the prompt has changed and it tells me yes you are working on chatsandra so every time we create a table read some data insert some data if there is no explicit mention of any key space that means i will be working on the chatsandra keyspace that's handy it makes commands a bit shorter so let's go on so we have been using chatsandra and now we are focusing on that keyspace and we can finally create the table so you see this in the readme you find this create table command we are first creating a table for storing users of this chat application now there is a question cql is generally case insensitive i i like to keep sql keywords in uppercase but that's just my choice in general sql is not case sensitive except when you use strangely capitalized names for tables and stuff then you have to quote them but please don't do that because it will be more hassle than than gay yes so you can make it case sensitive but for the table names and column names you know keep it same yeah keep it same yeah use what we call snake case so everything lowercase and if you need multiple words use underscore that is the easiest thing to use by the way that plays better with orms and object mappers if i remember correctly in almost all languages so yeah okay so this is how you create a table uh this is a command you've seen in the ch in the slides already so create table table name and then there is a series of column name and type column type you see email is a text name is a text and then there is this funny user id of type uuid now uuid is a special native data type available in cassandra and it is a unique uniquely generated id so it is a 128 bit if i'm not mistaken a sequence that is guaranteed to be unique well almost mathematically almost guaranteed to be unique and it might be generated independently on several machines and it guarantees not to to never to generate any collision so we will be having a table called users with email name password and uh well this id that we we will use it to refer to users in other tables okay so this is the most important part of this command is this last line primary key here because now we are saying that the primary keyword table is email not only that but you see this double parenthesis here we are also saying that email is not only the primary key so related to uniqueness of the rows but also is also the partition key uh you have so we have been speak speaking about partitioning and distribution of the data uh quite a lot and this will be very much important next week as well when speaking about data modeling but the important thing is that now the the columns that will be used to decide how to distribute distribute rows in this user table is the column email okay so enough with speaking let me copy this command and go and paste it here in the cql console let me paste it create table if not exist email and let me press enter by the way you see you can also have a multi-line command in sql console no problem now let me press enter you see i'm back to the prompt that means the command has implicitly succeeded otherwise i would get i i would have gotten an error now how do i know what is what tables are there well if i write desk tables short for described tables i will be told that there is a table called users wow very good so you should be able to be at this point also in your database i so if you desk tables you will you should be able to see table users i also i can also desk table users which will tell me basically my own you see my own create table statement plus a bunch of settings for this table settings related to how cassandra or how astra in this case manages several internal settings technical settings on of of how the table is is uh distributed and several maintenance tasks that happens behind the scenes but anyway the important thing is that if you describe this table you see that it is the very same table we created and this is how we created the table so can you give me a thumbs up if you manage to create the table and see it in the desk tables uh yeah very good yeah i see you guys are doing great yes yeah good so this is how you create a table in cql or in cassandra and or astrodb no um very good okay so uh let's create another couple of tables that's uh at this point it's not so it's not nothing so new look i'm creating tables to host to to to to store the posts by those users and you see the tables have fields such as user id which will refer to the other table of the users and then we have post id room id you remember gardening or whatever the post text and if you look at this primary key we have here a primary key that is two fields user at the end post id but only user id is used for the partitioning now i don't want to to dwell too much on this point because that's subject for next week but i'm this in this table partitioning is only by user id but i can have several rows with the same user ready and different post id because unicity is the whole primary key that means that my partitions will be made by several posts by the same every partition will be all posts by the same user because partition is by user but every row will be a different post id you remember what cedric has been saying about avoiding queries where you have to query several nodes the so-called full cluster scans yeah the point is that with this choice of partitioning i will be able to get all posts by a given user without asking more than one node which is good which makes the query go fast and indeed this table is called posts by user now the funny part and i will stop anticipating stuff now the funny part is that i also want to get all posts by for a given room and for that i will just create a second table with duplicated data just arranged differently because you see now the partitioning is by room so if i want to get all posts by a given in a given room regardless of who wrote those i will have to use this second table so this is funny and this is very much different than relational databases we have no fear in duplicating data just because we want to support different ways to read that so let me just copy these two create table statements and i'm creating two different tables which will basically contain the same rows just arranged differently the rows which will be one post in the chart in a chat in the chat application every row one post okay so you see i've i have created three tables and let me try this desk tables you see i have indeed three different tables in my key space ready to get data so um there we go yes so you the reason why it's better to create two tables for the post because they have to support two different ways to read data yeah the explanation for that will be subject of next week and it will be there will be more to say about data modeling i hope i just picked your interest now can you give me a thumbs up if you manage to create all three tables and if you are seeing them in your desk tables because this is what we really would like you to have a hands-on practice of yeah nice okay great okay very good um okay so it's good most of you have been getting your own hands dirty that's great um i think from this point on i will just go ahead and do demo and if you manage to follow along you're very good otherwise don't worry because everything is spelled out in detail in this readme and you will be able to do it later because by the way this is part of the lapse that you will have to do as uh completion to today today's session before next week so you will be be ready for next week right but before so maybe i can stop here before going on with the demo and uh give give it back to cedric for a little more explanations on what we just did yeah um it will be quick um again today we give you just a key to understand what is the table um how to put the first data in the database next week we will give you all the theory to build some optimized table how do you build a table how do you build the primary keys and and such here it just give you all the terms so tables and partitions so you just complete the first part of the of the end zone which is create a database using astra ui creating some tables using sql console so the smallest piece of data you need to understand is a cell okay it's something very you know very common nothing special but the data will be in a cell then with multiple cell you get a row okay pretty also you know pretty pretty of use if you have already used sql before okay then rows can be grouped into something called a partition and this is where you remind all the beginning of the presentation where partition is multiple rows having the same value for the partition key column so here if you look at my screen the latest column is my partition key so partition key is the name of the column department they all have the same value so they all are in the same partition and as such they are in the same node so when you execute a query against cassandra you want to have in your where clause the value of the partition key why because cassandra will know directly where all your data fit and that's kind of a spoiler for next week but you will build your table and schema based on your queries okay so that's partition and a table is a group of partition easy right cell row partition group of partition now just a couple of limits if you want to know in a cell you cannot go up to two terabyte of data physical limit and recommended size for a partition is less than one hundred thousand rows and less than 100 megabytes but again it will be covered in depth next week so that's the vocabulary cell row partition tables key space and cluster now you have you have it all all the levels uh so i think uh stefano you can go back just to demo but to do a little bit more with a partition and queries just create read update delete yes so let me switch to as being small again to show more screen and yes this is how it goes we will come back and do the game together with some prizes okay so um yeah so you've you've seen uh table creation now uh with the explanations by cedric it makes even more sense i guess now we created tables but of course these tables are all set already but they do not contain any piece of data yet so we start doing crowd operations grad operations means create read update and delete data from those tables and these are the building blocks of any interaction with a databases right so you always have to move data in and out and read and do stuff okay so let's start by writing some data in those tables now [Music] we start writing date some rows in the user table and we will just pretend there are three users in this chat server and they are called one one one five five five and nine nine nine so that those will be the the uuid of the users and we will use this id to as a reference also in the post table as we saw before and so we will start creating three rows in the users table representing the three users so we have you remember when we created the table we had email name password and user id so we want to create rows in this table and this is the command we will run so it will be insert into table name then you provide the list of columns you want to fill followed by values and the corresponding list of the values for each column so we with this statement we are inserting a row where email is odzie atmail.com name is odziwani password is this very unguessable password and the id is all once so i broke down this command in multiple lines for easier reading and let me paste it here in the console so insert into table column column column column values value value value value and that's it so you see this command succeeded and trust me the users table now contains one row which is very good so we will quickly insert also users called thread5e which is all five in the uad and nina90 which is all nines so let me nothing new here just we want to populate the table so let me just paste these two commands you see they succeeded and probably now we have three rows in this users table right now let me write a few more things so we want to make this chat application a bit realistic so i will write some post also why can't we use control v to paste this really depends on the browser and the operating systems in some browsers you can in other you can't so i i want to play the safe route for you to to be sure it works so right click and paste should always work but you can try exactly brother level uh sometimes at os level and it's for security reasons so if you cannot do control v you just right click and paste okay so let me write some rows let me insert some rows also in the post tables and this is really similar you see there is an insert into table name you remember post by users is one of the tables we created and then user id post id room id text so for example user one one one you remember user called one otziwani has created a post with a particular id in the room hiking you see roommate hiking and the text is some text he like to write let me just stress one point when we created the post by user the post id column is not of type uuid but is of a very much related type that is time uuid which is again a unique identifier but it also has the advantage of encoding a timestamp within the unique id that's that comes handy because it serves two purposes at once one is the unicity of the values of the uuid but also you can use this column to sort for example and you will have time ordered items so it's very handy and well let me let me paste this command here and run it so i'm inserting into post by user by the way you see i can spell the name of the table without prepending a key space because i'm working i'm still using and working on the key space called chatsandra so it's implied that's what you saw before when when we did use chatsandra that's the advantage now there are a few more inserts i will not go i will not show them in detail because they are really the same it's just different posts on various chat rooms by different users in this pretend chat application now an interesting twist because we have been writing into the table posts by user but you remember we created two tables for the posts because there is post by users and posts by room and they are supposed to contain a mirror copy one of each other so the same post in one table should appear in the other table just partitioned differently for different ways of retrieving the data and the the cool thing is that we we have to do that on our site which now means i have to copy paste as a similar list of insert statements but you see they are in post by room table and this is cool because um it means that when this will not be uh a sample session in the console anymore but it will be something handled at the application level your application will do the double rights which might seem uh a burden in but actually it is an opportunity for optimizing the the way you write data but probably there will be more on that next week i see alex is uh eager to to start so data modeling is a very cool topic very interested interesting okay so i apparently we've been writing a lot of rows in all three tables how can you make how can you be sure this this is this happened well you can do step two reading data so you see i could run a command like this and again this sounds very much like sql so select splat from table name let's see what happens you see what happens is that you get back all your rows i'm reading from table post by user and you see i have my results user id post id room id and text you see uh red is the color for the partition key light blue is the color for the the rest of the primary key and you see uh rows come grouped by user id that's because partitioning is by user d so all ones are together all fives are together but this will not be a very good way to query the data because um again i'm i'm trying to get all rows from all nodes so i'm actually getting results from several partitions which means if you remember what about partitioning of the data i'm actually speaking of i'm actually speaking to all nodes in the cluster and if this were a 2000 node cluster this query would be very slow and indeed i would get a warning from from the driver from the sql telling me wait are you sure you want to do that and indeed you should not do that so this is more like a serious query you might want to run in production you see i'm selecting some columns from this table where user id is a particular value so you see i'm asking for all posts by user111 and this is the kind of query i want to see in production because this will work fast it will be having constant access time even if my cluster is 200 000 nodes it will be fast because it will go directly to one node and here i get all the posts by user111 and only those but see they are mixed the room is mixed because this is just how partitioning of this table works okay so similar thing for the other room for the other table so if i want to get post by room you see if i just run a full cluster scan query sorry i copied instead of pasting if you run a full cluster scan query again you get all posts exactly as before all post but now you see i'm reading from the table partitioned by room so the grouping is by room you see now all running are here all hiking are here but again this is not the kind of query i would like to see in production because it is potentially very slow and very inefficient this is the kind of query i want to see for this table so this table is partitioned by room indeed a good query is the one where i have this where room id equal something and this query will give me all posts for the room hiking you see okay so these are let's say the basics of how you read data from tables and what is the right kind of query to run more on that next week you know that already by now okay so these are the reads um okay we can skip this part and we can update data so let's see let's say we want to um edit so overwrite and modify the values stored in the table now you want to change the value how do you what do you do you should update um an existing row now uh well here for reference there is how the insert was done how the table was built but the point is that if i want to change the value let's say of the text in a particular post in a particular chat room i want i i have to i have to do a write but there are two ways to do that indeed but the important point is that due to the way cassandra is structured basically updates and inserts are the same statement so you just write because in general writes in cassandra do not perform a read before writing so whether the row existed already or not you are just writing and if the row existed already you are overwriting it so how can you make sure you are overwriting it and not creating a new row well that's where the primary key comes into play because primary key guarantees unicity so if you are writing a row that has the same primary key value as an existing row you it's implied that if it exists already you are writing over it and replacing the values and this is what i'm doing now because you see posed by users now i'll scroll up a bit you see this now maybe you can see it here this mount gumbo was easy exist already with user id 1 1 1 and boss id aaa now i want to update the value in table post by user so this is one way to do it update table set field equal value and then you put aware clause where user id equal and post id equal and here i specify the whole primary key so that cassandra basically knows which rows it has to replace so let me run this statement this is how i update a value the important point is that if i want to replace a value in a row i have to specify the primary key to be able to reach that value to reach that row to define it properly but okay so if you now read again you will see that now i'm reading the row and you see that the text has changed so all seem to work there is a similar so there is a different way to to replace and to update the value which is well a consequence of the fact that inserts and updates are basically the same so if i just run a new insert with the same primary key values as an existing row as in this case you see this right is just the right as as a the first one we did but it so happens that the rows existed already and then automatically we have replaced it and indeed if you read if you read the table again the rows the text has been replaced by the way i did it twice because you remember we had two different tables for the post so i had to update the text in both tables which was a good chance to show you two different ways to do it with an explicit update statement and with just another insert in both cases i give the full primary key values which means i'm just overwriting an existing row and not creating a new one [Music] okay so the last point is how do you remove rows so let's see let me show you how many posts are there by user five and this i do we deselect select user five let me use already equal five five five so there are two different posts and for some reason i want to delete this one again the logic is very similar to inserting data because so to replacing data i want to delete a particular row but then i absolutely have to provide the full primary key because otherwise what what am i deleting okay so this is the statement in sql you run a delete from table and then you just specify the full primary key again if you look at this whole code i'm deleting manually twice from to the two tables because the post has to disappear from post by users and post by room and in the two cases look at the different way i specify the primary key i have to specify the primary key for that particular table i want to delete so let me run again the two selects before just as a way of proof so you see these two posts are two different rows from different tables and they are there now i'm deleting from one and deleting from the other again providing the proper primary key to specify what i am deleting okay should have executed and now if i run these two selects let's see the same they are the same selects as before and look the posts have disappeared so this for us humans is not there anymore in either table okay so okay this is really just a sample of the four main operations you do with the database you after creating a table you create data so you write the data you read data you update data and you delete data and this is how you do them in sql so this part i just demoed it but you are very much encouraged to go through it to try the commands and to read the few the the explanations that are here that will give more context and we'll get you ready and primed for next week about the data modeling uh i think with that the demo part is over cedric so i can switch back to uh directly to many right yeah i think now it's time to play the game sometimes okay so let's give the code again i hope you did not uh close your mentee connection because you still have time okay yeah the code the code will show up because it's now quits time so yeah okay so let's see if i can if we can show the join screen again for you to jump on board and maybe we can have some music oh yeah if you can have the music that's even better should not be too loud let's see okay so not do not forget that this time you better use mandy and not youtube yeah so the link should be in the chat that's me the link is there so many dot com and then you insert the code you see now on screen yeah um okay so please jump on board there will be a few questions and this time the faster you answer the more chances you have to end up in the first three places and win some prizes yeah um i was keeping up when the question will start please look at your phone or you know dedicated mentee because the question will show there first and uh the you know the fastest you answer the more points you get so and youtube got one two second delay so you know to be sure to be as fast as possible look closely at your melody screen yeah absolutely so i see you all guys are joining us what do you think cedric we wait a few more i don't want anybody to be frustrated uh so let's say no a couple of seconds yeah the numbers i think you can move to next screen because it will be wait for player right okay oh okay so we wait for players okay so um get ready because you have to answer correct and answer fast and there will be questions about what we learned today so i think we can start and yes you have to answer fast if you want to get more points so how many master nodes does a cassandra cluster need at least three per cluster or three per data center perhaps enough to maintain consistency or not a single one because cassandra is decentralized so let's see a few seconds more to go two one time's up let's see the answers oh i see a lot of correct answers not a single one so cassandra has no master has no leader every node is equal to every other so it's completely decentralized and congratulations to those who got this right let's see who was the fastest who was the fastest i think we have a lot of very fast typers and gene was is the fastest but it's very close so the game is still very open and let's move to next question then question number two answer fast to get more points in cassandra how is data being distributed so all data is replicated to each server or by partitions range of partitions per node or with address locators or using post mail so how would you do that how would you distribute data in cassandra probably by writing a nice letter with the stamp let's see by partitions very good so it is not true that all data is replicated to each server simply well because think about a very huge database there will be no single machine able to host the whole of it so it has to be split and how it is split is by partitioning as we discussed let's see let's see let's see um fastest is etson who jumps to first position but it's very close closely followed by jin and vishnu follows after okay so there are still a few questions to go so everything can happen and let's go question number three answer fast to get more points which replication factor is the recommended value let's see it is 1.5 it is 3 it is 15 or it is a hopping 42 the answer to all questions of on the in the universe let's see but i don't think we put 42 as a valid question as a valid answer did we well i hope we did a good job at yeah we did looks like we did so yeah three is the is usually the the correct value now it's very weird to think of 1.5 because you would have to you know take a server and divide it in two halves but anyway three is the right answer unless there are very specific needs three is usually the right choice and let's see the fastest was who jumps a bit but edson jin and vishnu maintain the first three positions so they are poised to claim their prices but let's see there is still a few questions to go number four answer fast to get more points what is astrodb it is a gateway to the stars it is a local in-memory version of cassandra it is a database as a service built on cassandra or it is a development tool a few quests a few seconds to go time's up let's see it is a database of the service built on cassandra well done well done and that means let's see fastest adzon who maintained first position but vishnu jumps to second position okay so but everyone else is very close all the first 10 are very close so there we still there might still be surprises and let's see question number five what happens answer fast to get more points what is a primary key it is the same as the partition key it is the main house key it does not apply to nosql databases it is a unique identifier for a row or it is a column in the partition key let's see time's up and uniquely identifies a row correct now it might be the same as the partition key in some cases and for some tables and that's entirely a valid pattern but it is not always the same so logically it's a different concept and let's see of the first positions who managed to get almost all of you got it right and vishnu fastest but edson maintain first position but it's still a handful of points so so let's see with what is happening to mandy question number six there was a moment of glitch but yeah yes it recovers hopefully too many people are mentally right now so what is the partition key in instead it is a consecutive number applied to each new record it is a field in your table to partition your data it is an optional table field field for optional partitioning or it or the key to partitioning this reality from the next whoa let's see it is a designated field in your table to partition your data very good and it is not optional because it is really in the foundational idea of how cassandra stores the data so you cannot have table without partitioning in cassandra okay let's see the results and yeah a bit of shuffling of data but ah gene jumps to second position adds and maintain the first one but i see there are some challengers down there so question number seven all all marbles now let's see last question executing a select query without the partition key is what is the recommended way to retrieve data it is the right way if the data was inserted without a partition key or it is a way to full cluster scan or it is maybe illegal and punishable by law [Music] let's see ah it is a way to full cluster scan yes if you do a select without partition key you potentially speak to all nodes and that's not good in production and tell me tell you that there are some i know some people who would really like to make it illegal yeah totally legal yes i agree sometimes we joke about the cql police catching you doing an allow filtering and that's really bad but now we have a winner and edson maintains first position and is winning with uh jin and vishnu second and third so congratulations edson jin and vishnu be awarded the price but congratulation you all for staying with us so far and learning so much that's the real reward as they say but more to the point to the winners at zonjin please take a screenshot of your winning mentee screen i will not close the menu now i will just jump to cedric if that's okay you take a screenshot sorry yeah you you take the screenshot now um stefano will move to just an open question like we use as a survey all right we can improve improve anything uh winner sent a screenshot to jackfryer seen on screen yeah we will show that again so just a quick survey we want you to help us improve so please uh let us know what did you like in this workshop and what we should improve for next time yes maybe i can let's leave yeah open yes exactly okay yeah so if you already win if you have already won any swag from us you know just say it to to have as many people as possible win the swag because we do not uh shipped swag to the same people twice okay so um we are almost done for today uh so just wrapping up now a little bit more about homeworks what we expect you to do over the week in between the two lives uh so uh you know you can use homeworks uh and you will see you would have a dedicated part on the readme in github so three action three items uh item one complete the labs we did together today so very easy stefano did the demo you can always watch the replay so complete the lab easy just follow the instruction two start your training teaching learning materials for this week we ask you to start ds201 which is a free online courses to get the cassandra fundamentals so a bit more deeper than these two hours there you will see um i think uh yeah i don't know how many parts of the of the courses but you know please take it [Music] you you don't need to do the exercises that's really all about the video looking looking at at the the learning materials if you want to do the exercises go for it but hold together with the exercises it will take you about four hours so you know just for you to know but you know nothing preventing you to do it um for the courses and exercises we recommended using docker for the exercises okay so second training third field the form uh just validating your week just to get a badge okay and you know badge is always good to have you can share it on linkedin and such so three things all detailed in the homework next week uh we will cover the data model uh of you know cassandra and start talking about our app we will build together called the to-do application uh so you know stay tuned it will be same time next week so two sessions one on wednesday so it's uh 5 p.m utc on wednesday and on thursday that ap 8 am utc and if you live in india the thursday is 12 30 ist yes ds201 recommended that's a kind of a something you need to do if you want to go for the certification you know certification it's not easy it's a certification okay so better need to come prepare and ds201 is a good way to to start you will see over the week you will have multiple courses to to take this one is just the two one is just the first the purpose is really to be ready end of january to take the certification and if you need any help because the chat of youtube will be closed very soon we we are on discord this is the link and the way to access it we are more than seventeen hundred thousand on seventeen thousand on not hundred thousand yet thirteen thousand um on discord uh where you can see people chatting all week long questioning about all kind of things uh it's a funny community so you know come and join us live and subscribe to youtube if you enjoy the show that's helped us coming back every week but you know nothing more to tell you today hope just you enjoy the show and hope to see you next week tell your friend it's not too late uh you know just the first session has just been made we're just starting the full the four weeks uh so you know anyone interested in learning would be interesting in this content i hope yeah so uh the day is over i think cedric oh yes it is it is i was thinking a final word i don't know but yeah it was a pleasure to be with you today and uh yeah hope to see you next week thank you for staying with us hope you had fun see you next time and goodbye everyone cheers and as always don't forget to click that subscribe button and ring that bell to get notifications for all of our future upcoming workshops gifted with powers from the goddess of cassandra who grew those powers until she can multiply it will move with limitless speed and unmask hidden knowledge with those powers she was able to fully understand
