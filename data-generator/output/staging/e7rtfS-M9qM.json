to change me on the same page [Music] myself [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music] all right everybody I think we are live we are together for two hours uh so let's get rolling uh before starting just download your check uh can you give us a sum up if you hear me well if you hear Aaron well so Herod please say a few words hey everyone hey everyone well I heard me I think it's okay okay all right so let's get running uh absolutely man I'm leading the development team at data Stacks trainer public speaker uh you see me every week or very often uh so let's move quickly today with me Aaron hey hello everyone I'm Aaron yep you see me often too and I see Cedric all the time so there you go so you in good shape for today so um today we will build a clone of the goodread goodread apps using Java and spring technical stack but before starting quickly a little bit of housekeeping if this is the first time you join one of those Live technical Workshop so the content has been built be with me Aaron but also the world team that you can see on screen there will also help you during The End Zone on following your question on the YouTube chat because it's Interactive so we are Live on YouTube the session is recorded and you can come back later and see the video it's interactive because we will ask you question uh first a very simple question uh about where are you uh where do you live and in the end a game to see if you pay attention about what we stated we are monitoring the YouTube chat once for your question we also have a Discord room because if you watch the recording right now uh cannot really interact with us this is the Discord room you need to go to also keep asking questions all the time it's a workshop not a webinar we expect you to work do some technical exercises grow some code and you don't have to install anything all the materials are on GitHub the readme um the readme the slides the exercises the instruction you will need a database of course we will use a cloud database free to use and you need an IDE with spring and Java and Maven and you don't have to install either we will use an ID in the cloud called GitHub which is a kind of vest code in the cloud it's very powerful you will have a a very good understanding and also it's free yeah that free part's important yeah all about the freaks uh okay so I told you it would be interactive so how does these interactive work uh so you open a new tab or you use your phone and you go to mentee.com and you enter the code that is on screen and you will be with me live playing the game and during the time waiting for people to join I see cran stating that it's the the URL is not in the comment so uh let me fix that right away for you uh but yeah now the GitHub repository is in the YouTube well that was quick all right uh I see 40 people on YouTube only eight uh in the in the quiz um let's wait for one more minute and you know let's move oh you're welcome okay uh so for now it's not a it's not a contest it's just a question for you okay and it's a single question where are you from we are live uh we try to pick uh at times a time that would it fit most time zone but sometimes we cannot really fit everybody so let's see uh and see it's it's distributed right we have folks from emea are back and North America so uh that's great and if you're joining from India or even Eastern thank you very much for joining I know it must be late for you so we will stay together for two hours I promise we will stick to the two hours slot uh so thank you very much for joining we'll try our best oh hey someone on from Nigeria that's that's awesome um yeah the the more the more and more we do these Cedric um I'm seeing more folks from like um like Brazil South America as well as a lot of countries in Africa and that's just that's so cool that we're kind of getting that that uh flavor of the world you know exactly I love that and uh yeah it is distributed so yeah um all right um so I promised it was very quick but it's just to show you how to use menti because at the end of the session again we will have a quiz and this is where you will answer a question see your name on screen and see if you pay attention in the session you can have a badge so there is no certificate to just attend the session but if you do the end zone with us at the end you can do a screenshot about your walking app send us the the screenshot using a Google phone we will share with you and you can have this badge and you can share this badge on LinkedIn uh we have overall more than 30 different batches which are uh so many topics that are covered on its Channel but it's always better to be live with us interact and ask question ah so today we are building a a clone of Google of Goodreads so I wanted to show you uh what does this clone look like okay so it's a it's an app called better reads and you can search for some uh book title okay and uh you know later on you will search the same book title as me uh but you know for now let me uh copy paste so you use you search for for books uh you know in the database search get a few books that will match your request if my laptop and Swami come on my friend okay and uh so you can view the book and say oh get the details of this book and if you know you is it is a book that you are reading you want to log in using your Google account you will do that as well today you log in and now look at that it's part of my books here I can say and say oh I start read this book today uh I expect to be complete by the end of the of the of the you know of the week and uh submit and when you've done I wonder if I wonder if my books are in there [Laughter] there are uh I think it's yeah 30 million books maybe I don't know if yours is there uh maybe I did not load the totality of the data sets in my database today that's okay um so that to do so we are using a database we are using spring data Spring Security spring uh uh spring web uh and so let's all together with this app all right okay so you saw what the app looked like and when you have a new app to build you need a methodology and um our goal here is to build the clone of Goodreads so the purpose is to find get and share book you love with everyone right so um in real time in a single application everyone in the world can use this app and you can have a lot I you know I fruit puts high volume of requests coming so to implement that that methodology we will use today is togaf so the graph is just a way to help you check all the boxes when you implement a new app so you start with the vision then first the business architecture what it's supposed to do then do fine grain go to the function that you should Implement switch to technology how do we Implement that and finally the the solution so um if I look at the business that she take to it's a web app uh based on the demo you saw that you can do a search find some books pay on based on your search you can also log in see your books that you already read and you can uh again search One sign in and add one book in your library and when you do so you are specifying the start date the end date the ratio and the status okay this is what the app looked like uh kind of the business that she take to one step further now if I show you what it looked likes based on the demo you just saw um same screen home page with the search and you can log in then search without login uh here you show the the book and you are not login or you log in this time with GitHub so hopefully we will have time to implement login both with GitHub and Google with Google which is cool right because when you build apps this is what you want your user to authenticate you know they can still use email and password but let's be honest especially for mobile now everybody will log with either GitHub or uh yeah and single sign-on just makes things easier for everyone totally so what technique [Music] it's a Java Workshop that we will we will go we will go with Java uh so it's a web app and we will use spring so spring web for the web UI spring data to interact with the with the database Spring Security to authenticate with Google and and GitHub we will use something called HoHo 2 Event open ID connect uh and the the rendering the web will be time leaf a question on the chat uh does it use full text search no and uh I will explain uh that why in a minute that's for the uh web app and this is in the title of the workshop so we did not lie to you this is what we will do uh so now what about the database well uh we will use Apache Sandra so you are on the data Stacks developer channel uh we are contributing to the upper chicas on our product and we are working to make Cassandra uh aware and you know make everyone aware of this great database so it's a nosql distributed database you want to install Castle on multiple nodes there is no real Sense on the single node it's big data ready uh if you need more throughput or more volume simply add new notes it will scale linearly it's famous for the read and write performance it can scale very very uh far like apple stated that they do have 300 000 Casandra nodes and they're doing they have online 12 petabytes that's crazy right I know that's crazy yeah and it's not olap right it's not the end of the day queries it's real time uh also it's known to be self-filling and automated your data is replicated if you learn if you lose any of the node the database is still okay because your data is available on multiple nodes open source solution its platform agnostic it's just a terrible you will uh you know uh unzip and install in any Cloud you like uh or on your machine not windows but uh any machine VM whatever and it's Van Der independent so there is no change focus on how to change the license anytime soon on the contrary of others database that had to change to protect themselves against uh the cloud vendors uh agpl licenses and yeah yeah I know what you're talking about yeah yep yep Cassandra doesn't have to do any of that exactly so uh we will use that database for today uh because we suspect that for the better reads which is a global distributed application we want the data as close as possible to the user and we can have user all across the world uh like apple again did everything starting with an eye seems to store some data on Castle but you know Netflix also doing the same okay so enough that's the database we want to use nosql so now what about the data set where do I find all those books uh well and there is a website called open Library where you can find a data set of millions of millions of authors and books so what we did for today we download the Dems and we import the dumps in the database okay to see the book details and everything but for the search we were a little tricky when you search in the user interface you are still searching against open Library why because in open Library you do have the full text search whereas in Casanova it's not it's not meant to be full text on the contrary of uh solar or elasticsearch faster so in again it's a workshop for developers so we are not trying to sell you that database can do anything we will show you what it's do and do well foreign all right we told you uh you will not have to install Cassandra so uh multiple strategy we could have go the docker route but then when you use Docker you still have to download the docker image and start the docker image what about using uh database as a service in the cloud for free and that's uh the data Stacks platform called Astra that is like Astra containing multiple Services the Cassandra database a streaming engine filter and all the the tools and UI and and uh yeah and in libraries for you to help with with the use of those technology so this is why you see all these dots on screen uh once are there there are multiple ways to access it but today I need to choice we made we want to stick to the original way to interact with customer so let's use the gold the good old Java Cassandra drivers because this is the one that are used by Spring data but we could have picked uh apis like grpc rest document oriented so if for some reason you are JavaScript developer and you say ah maybe the drivers is not uh you know new enough and you want to go with the API wrote be aware that it's uh it's a features of the data Stacks platform that we will not cover today and so following our autograph methodology if I dig one step further now it's the technical uh architecture so the database Cassandra with some tables here in the middle open Library we will dump the text file we will do some data cleansing data format to produce a CSV and the CSV can be imported into Casino so that's also part of the work you might have to do to migrate an existing system together you will have to format the data in a way to ease the bulk loading because you will see that importing record per record technically speaking it's working but it's quite slow and for the web app uh we wanted that to be used as a reference app and if you have already login to the GitHub repo you can see that there are significant amount of fork of this repo and the reason is the quality is pretty good and it's using the the the spring standard the good way to build the spring up something you can use later in your work uh to leverage on and build your own apps and I will really do my best to explain all the parts of this app with you today so to to build this app or rebuild this app we will go layer by layer starting with the data and moving the layer one after the other so we will have to start by initializing the database okay so you might think uh okay um when I build an app I if you are familiar with relational database first you design your entities okay based on the entities you design your schema the joints the primary Keys the foreign Keys many too many relationships one to many relationships and when you have that you can create the the object The Entity relationship schema mql mdl and um based on that you give that to the developer and it is the developer to find out what are the good SQL queries how to joins the table together to match what the application needs to do it's data first and application last because the developers need to find out what are the good requests to do eventually put some indexes and stuff to make that work but the main goal is to have one data the data only once and and choose some in consistency no no uh no um duplicate data and like yeah no odd dependencies here and there between the entities yep yep for sure the the pattern is reversed and this is why I show you the business I should take to your first what other screen you need to implement what would be the queries that need to happen under the hood to make that screen available and based on the queries you will build your tables and if you need to have the same data on multiple screens but access in different ways you will probably have to duplicate the data and that's the way of thinking of nosql it's not a problem to duplicate the data as long as we are targeting performance performance performance it's like we are doing the joints when we save not the joints when we read that's a good way of looking at it yeah yeah it's called denormalization because there you will find tables with maybe a lot of number of columns instead of doing the joints when you read so it's different how would you do that uh as you know a learner well there is a methodology uh and on um academy.datastacks.com you would find some free courses deep dive to learn about Cassandra and how to build the data model but today I wanted the session first to stick into our and to be practical so I will just if you wish apply the methodology on this app and I think it's will give you already a fairly understanding of what it is okay okay so that's the overall methodology I prefer using this schema so to build your model you need two fundamental things first is the conceptual data model so you still need what are the entities what are the attributes how do I ensure Unicity of this entity uh how those entity interact with each other so the E Air diagram entity relationship diagram in uml it's still valid so this one is good you don't have to change it coming from rational but certainly you need the queries because remember you will have your table based on the queries that you need to make and so if somebody asks you oh I have this Oracle or MySQL or SQL application that you need to move to Cassandra for performance reason because it's uh it's well known that Castle Rock can scale a lot uh they would say how we do that well you will reuse the conceptual data model but it's not enough you will have to ask them hey what are the exact queries that has done that is made against these models to build your tables with those two inputs you get the logical data model and gets the physical data model so you might think I'm moving fast in the slides again I I wanted the the session to be interactive and and you know you do stuff as well those slides are on the GitHub repo it's a PDF you can come back and you know read that at your own pace no problem so in our better reads application we are working with three entities book author and user and A Auto can write multiple books uh and you as a user once connected you will also have multiple you will read multiple books so you have one too many user books one too many auto books and some relationship written by read and as you can see there are some attributes foreign one thing you might notice is some of those are a double run here like the covers well it's because you can't have multi-valued attributes so here in the table book if you wish a book can have multiple covers because you can have multiple editions and you will have a list of cover part of the role in that book table cool right so this is cool I told you oh you cannot do joints when you read with Cassandra uh but still you know uh some one too many relationship can be done at the table level you know if you um just if you have multiple covers for a book this is what you do okay that's our entities what about the queries which is the second part of the model application workflow well again uh it's the same slide as before but now you see some numbers uh and we try to put some uh details on each query so at the uh the first row is the public path you are not authenticated and so the first query we will do is search books it's Q2 and q21 give me a details from that book and there there is no user involved you are in Anonymous way and so there is no point of having users information in those table the second row the second line on screen is the authenticated path so now q1 is actually Authentication then q11 is show me the books from a user and q12 is put some details for a user and a book so you might think in that final table you will have all the information gathered if I use the notation the official notation to represent that this is how it's uh how it is so you have one path authenticated One path public uh the different screens and the different queries and now we have everything we need to build that model logical data model okay moving on to that I keep those slides for you as reference with customer in a nutshell one query is one table and again if you need the same data on multiple screen you will duplicate the data on multiple tables so q21 so remember q21 was the public path you want to get the detail of a book without a user so here it's a table called books by ID you just want the detail of one book when you provided the identifier of that book so K here mean um partition key which in that case ensure Unicity of the Rico second table book by user so this time you are authenticated you get your user ID and the query will be give me all the use give me all the books that these users have read and so what you will put in your workloads is the user ID and when something need to be in the workload and part of the filter it needs to be part of the key of the table so here I put the user ID so as you can see the K called the partition key is not enough this time to hunch on Unicity because you will have multiple books for one user you need more colors and those extra columns part of the key are called clustering column this is why here you see a c and they are used to do some inequality queries or to ensure Unicity So reading status would be to order the book on screen by reading status first so what are the book that I already finished what are the book that are in progress what are the book that I never I did not start and it was by Design This is how um we decided to order those books on the screen by the reading status and this is why it's used as first clustering column then time uuid which here is the insertion date if you wish we want to get the latest first and for some reason it's your insert two books for the same user at the same time very unlikely but you know never nevertheless you will go back here find the book ID so you notice that book ID is in those two tables but there is no Integrity constraint there okay uh I will go uh a bit more faster on the latest table so now with q11 you are authenticated and you want to provide the details of that book starting reading date and reading date and rating so this is what you see here and to access those record in the table you need both a user ID and the book ID okay and uh based on that we are almost done right we already know what the table look like we need to go to the physical data model uh think about a uh can we optimize can we join some colon because for instance I have a column which is an identifier another column that is a timestamp maybe we can use the time type as an identifier stuff like that try to reduce the the number of of field the number of tables and uh also ask the question a should I use the default rules which is one table one query or two queries are similar enough that I can reuse the table that's unlike heat weapon but sometimes it's it's happening uh I know I'm moving fast but again to have these 12 hour courses for free on just Cassandra data modeling techniques and Sample please go to academy.site.com take the courses code ds221 we're 220 and you know what if you finish that courses and you provide us on this code your uh email address you use in the academy uh we will make sure you can also try the certification because why not you are with us in the million of the workshop uh so privilege for you that would be uh you know cool to you to get certified on Cassandra that skill is useful more and more people will have more and more data and guess what either it will not fit the existing relational database or you will have to move the database in the cloud and cloud is a Distributing distributed system and relational database are not at ease in the cloud or do not scale as much as you want okay a long story short this is what the physical data model look like so with the book I can have a list of photos a list of auto names and the cover ID see it's also a list um okay but you know what we are already 30 minutes in in that workshop and I had quite some detail to share with you to go with these statement which is the statement you need to create the tables in the database so it's called SQL customer language close to SQL but not exactly the same you see that some attributes are not the same some keys are not exactly the same but with that we can you can finally start with the enzyme portion of that and to do so uh let's together jump into Lab One lab one uh part one is uh create the database generate a token to access the database and after that we will load some data so I will do that with you so you can now do the step with me all the instructions on GitHub step by step as I show you so uh here it is it's really uh step by step so I have you know nothing special that I would do that you would not um so we can do it at your own pace okay so first thing first uh create Astra account authenticated with either a GitHub or Google uh I will go with Google um and so yeah prerequisite for this session is having a a Google account or GitHub account or Google account because we are using tools that are free but they will ask you your Google account total ticket uh we but we are not using any of your information of course so here I'm logging to uh my Astra account and as a user in Astra you can have a multiple workspace multiple uh yeah workspace where to work and at that that's like doing the workshop we like to use that that's text devs workshops which is the an empty organization so right now I'm like you if you authenticate it for the first time you are like me you have the same screen and that's probably easier for you to follow what I'm doing so what I need to do is uh go to uh settings and organization admissions generate token so two ways to do it either you go to organization settings if you are using the same user interface as me so I will do it like that I go here I dose to organization settings token management make it bigger select a role so the role we need to pick is called here organization administrator and I will generate the token so in this token you you see client ID client secret token or security reason this token will never be shown to you again because it's you know uh it is and it will be the same later you will see if GitHub and Google when you create client ID client secret those are sensitive information so that they are shown to you once and then uh cannot be accessed so good practice please download your token details here I save my details but what I can do as well is open a text file and copy my token using that in my text file and why I'm doing that moving that to a second screen because I will reuse that token very quickly right so yeah Step One is what we wanted you to do and if you look at the at the instruction it's not exactly exactly the same because in the user interface we have a a new uh UI so if and if I enable that new user interface let's look it looks better but this time to create a token you go to settings at the bottom left part on the screen and he again token management select a role organization Administration generate token and here we have a second token um if you are watching the recording and all the token that I'm using today will be immediately deleting deleted so do not try to pause the video and copy that it's not working anymore yeah yeah our security people have been on top of us for that one yeah security people are you know exactly on top of it so uh you have your Astra environment uh declared and you have a token and that's enough to start working with the environment because instead of clicking the button we will use a command line interface to generate what needs to be generated for us uh maybe before moving on uh how are you doing so um in the chat can you tell me that um yeah I've been trying to help um billboard in the with um yeah getting a good response back from from Astro CLI I think he's getting ahead of us a little bit but um you know hopefully um hopefully we'll get to the bottom of that it looks like his uh his database is up though from what I can tell okay so yeah it's a bit ahead of us but we are moving there very very fast so I will go back in slides mode not for too long I promise now that you are already the your ends in the on the keyboard we want to you want you to stay there uh so I promise that pose will be short okay moving on to uh here data loading so we we just designed what are the table we need to create but how would you populate those tables if I download the data from open Library I download the data terms those are you know 7 to 11 gigabytes and those are text files and it's not so easy to import so a first attempt was to create some Java code that will read those texts file line one after the other build an object save the object in the database which is working right there is nothing wrong about that just read the line get the the the as the entity save the entity in the database yep simple simple exactly and if you want to get the book by the IDS you can create a table book by ID so far so good and uh you are doing a little Java code that will use Auto Dem file book Dem file do the little magic and save the book this code is there for there it's a unique test uh but spoiler alerts we are not asking you to to run that test because if I start to run that test you will realize that this approach even if it's working take a while so the app is starting the app is loading connecting to the database and here I go fully okay connection is initialized here I go and the batch starting it's working right I'm using a text row I creating another and I save link to the database and on top of it I'm loading first the auto and then the books and I'm doing that but if you you know you saw that and you feel even if you do two three five rows per second how much time do you need to import the file because those files are uh 260 million books so I do the count I do the The Benchmark with that and it you would need almost one year 2080 days to import the book uh that I set and you will it will take 10 days to import the author data set can we do better that's a lot of time just can we do better yes we can I think so and we will do better um I I agree we do not want to optimize too soon right uh but here it feel like this approach uh it's not what we want what we want to use is a belly clauder something that will take a static file and that will load everything in the table that could exist it's called a data Stacks bulk okay it's called Data stack but it's a free open source tool that you you can pick to load the data and that tool need a CSV file to import all your data so what I did previously to save you some time I import the author and the books in different table using TS bulk and then an export I did the joints to have in one table the book info and the author info because you know as by default it's two different dump so it's two different data set and I need them in the same table so I if you wish I had to pass all the author put that in memory and start reading the books unwrenching the book record with the author each time and save saving the table so it took a while and I had something finally I produced CSV file that I share with you today and this is this file that you will load in your database uh so this is what I did load all the author put that in memories the ash map look the books 13 gigabyte past the books and produce this CSV and that's CSV you will use to load in the database um so the data set we will use is Alpha million books we did not put the world data set because that was not the point of today you will feel your database and use some credit for nothing I mean so uh Astra is free up to 80 million queries amounts uh and it's free forever so every month the credit is refreshed uh so for today Alpha million is more than enough to illustrate that using DS bulk is way way faster okay I promised it was shocked with the slide and now we will take a bit more time on the endzone portion so here we go uh ends on ends back to the keyboard switching switching here we go so this is the state we wear when we stopped I have my Astra database over here I have my demo running locally but we don't care let's remove that tab so 1.3 I will right click and open in a new tab it will start our gitpod alignment remember this is our IDE available for free in the cloud it will take maybe one minute to start in that IDE a you already also have Java install Docker Maven Med also python go PHP that tool is impressive they are everything installed already for you um and so then you don't have to install Java you don't install Maven everything is ready for you you know you can say Java dash dash version DVDs Maven Dash version V and we also give the Astro CLI that's out there too yeah exactly exactly and and there uh what we want to do with these uh tool is uh first connect to me well let me go back here just remove this pop-up um so this platform Astra also offer a range of Technical apis and we will use those technical apis to create what we need instead of using the user interface but everything we do to the CLI could also be done in the user interface let me close all that that or in the web uh I will remove that and make it big enough okay so let me okay all right okay big enough um when you start this environment uh there is a possibility for us to add some commands to install what needs to be installed so we installed for you the CLI so if you do Astra dash dash version you will see that you or just asked her you will see that you have the CLI uh uh installed and ready for you all those one order 2.1 so the first thing we need to do with this CLI is configuration we need to connect these alignments with the database we just created and to do so we will use the command as trust setup okay there it asks me to provide my token so remember the token I put here in the text file here it is I will copy my token and put it there I will hello yeah the first time you paste something in gitbot you can have this security uh warning just validate and hello okay yeah good pad does a little bit of that it'll say the same thing when it tries to open up like the default web page too you'll have to like allow that but yeah exactly F1 security reason um okay that's right oh sorry now it's done I mean it's it sounds uh you know magic but just this token is enough to set up the connectivity between these and and the database because now I can say Astra user list and see that I'm uh in the organization I see that all these data Stacks guy are part of the organization but if I want to to maybe get more information and say Astra org from our organization and see I'm connected to the data Stacks Dev Workshop the one that we were using here from the beginning right because I just provide the token so now it's there uh then if I want to um see what other database running but now it's empty that's expected right nothing is started and uh what we want to do to start is create a database called Workshop workshops with the S and we will use a key space so a key Space is really like a Oracle schema in a single custom raw database you can have multiple key spaces so here I'm copy and paste and let the CLI do its job starting the database and uh give me back the prompt when everything is ready you can ask the CLI to do everything asynchronously um but it's better to to do la this way also I agree you need to realize that you are building a three nodes database so it it can take a bit of time yeah yeah let us know in the chat if you're having any issues with this and we'll uh we'll do our best to help you out here and so you know I can probably go back to the user interface refresh the user interface and you see that these Workshop database is there and actually pending foreign is like five minutes yeah yeah something like that um I suppose you know well I was gonna say maybe you could open up another terminal window and run like a master DB list I can also you know do uh kill this one and redo a strategy list uh it will show me a pendulum right it's not it's not a problem it's just that uh I know it's just waiting for response yeah yeah but now I need to hey look at that now it's active see and if I go here it's as switch to active we have a database available for free okay uh now it's time to move on the database is running what we need to create the tables I explained the the methodology for the data model let's just create the the the just let's create a table so uh a couple of command we put you uh show me the the statues yeah it's active show me the details of the database uh you will get hey so the database is active it's running in gcp so when you create a database and ask how you can choose whether gcp uh Azure on AWS but for the Azure and WS region you need to provide a credit card so let's use the free one which is the CP and when you use the CLI by default it's a free one so it we didn't have to think about it but if you are already using AWS or you are using already uh Azure when you create the database this is a question that has been asked to you which cloud and where are you located the the region is the idea is always to get you as as close as POS then get your data as close as possible to you for our performance database that's a great idea to make the uh the free regions the default on that that when did you do that Cedric that had to be recent time nut CLI keep improving under the hood right because it does yes I'm the one who created that that tool in particular no but that's good that takes out a lot of the guesswork especially when we have new people and we're trying to direct them to the right the right region so yeah that's awesome yeah watch History um okay um so the database there let's let's move on let's move on we need to create some uh some table so to interact with Castle Rock there is a tool called cqlsh this time that's Aaron who contributed to that tool I did that's right that's right uh so yeah you are in in good hands with both of us um so the CLI will actually download this solution when it's needed set up the solution and connect and as you can see right now it's empty but what I will do is import the data or create the create the table Sorry by importing this schema.ddl so if you look here in the file system in data set here there is a uh there is a file with the instruction to create the tables okay so this is the one we will execute so one two three four table expected now let me close that put the terminal in big again because hey this is what matter and I run this command okay nice now if I want to describe my table again I should have my tables all right one two three four over here we are good um excellent great uh maybe I should pause here and wait in the chat to tell me that if you can keep up for those who want to do the steps with me yeah it looks like um you know the board was the one who's having trouble before but he's he's okay as long as he runs it in get pod um as opposed to I'm guessing the other the other alternative was on his local so yeah I I almost wonder if um you know maybe there's maybe the keys aren't the same yeah I I don't know it might be worth might be worth looking at that but yeah anyway he says it's working now okay nice uh almost almost done with the database after one hour um but you know at least you got the methodology it's not coming out of nowhere uh so the table are there now we need yeah to know which token are in use you can do Astra config list just to see that hey I'm using a data Stacks Dev workshop and if you want to double check on the token you can do Astra config get default and it will show you exactly the token you are using expert expert moments you know for Vivo maybe to see if it's uh if it's working uh okay so now what about the data as I told you uh here we have some big files okay open anyway let's see if it can open it uh yeah it's open that's big CSV file and this is what we want in the database and we will use DS bulk as I explained before but the ninth thing with the CLI is this CLI will download the esberg and set up this bulk for you to work with with your instance so here if I want to see what the CSV look like I can do a head so here you see I do have these book by ID table there how many rows well if I count the rows for this first file yeah it's about 200 and 250 kilos a bunch and so if you want to um import we can use 1.7.c which is load [Music] so load in the database Workshop in the keyspace better reads in the table book by ID that we just created you don't care about the error number and this is the file you need to import uh spoiler alert again uh it you will have about 183 errors I've not gotten into the file that much to see why you see those errors maybe we are eating some special character things it was good enough for the demo in here look at the footput before it was three percent and it was uh my laptop and my code limiting the throughput here I'm I can reach 2 000 read per second and this time this is Astra that having a threshold uh because I'm again on a free instance I have X transaction per second available but you know if I if I pay for further for for my instance that limit is removed and I can easily you know multiply this throughput by by 50. uh now the limit uh is is removed okay thank you Viber great that you enjoyed you know I think it's sort of slide in the beginning but it's worth it because then you populate the database very quickly and here it is I'm done for the first file and I will do the same for the second one nothing really to say much it's same principle with the second file and this time it's also 200 and thousand rules why did I split those csvs or maybe it's easier to commit on GitHub right because if I commit by two big GitHub is not happy it's getting even better look at that I'm about to you know 2600 2700 Ropers ago yeah yeah you're getting there getting there oh oh uh melroy you absolutely can get um Astra CLI using Brew yeah so it's it's really uh yeah it's um yeah Justin just provided uh but I think today it's uh it's it's broken for some reason so I really need to fix Brew uh but yeah there is a proof for that of course uh but yeah I do have a problem with the path and the latest blue um so yeah give me just a couple of days to fix proof but yeah it's it's there yeah so so of course I was tempting to to um to have Astra Brewing standard now and you know Aaron got the same issue before you need to know that to be able to post in the public Brew repository your code needs to be famous you need to have 100 stars on GitHub and 70 forks and a lot of stuff and as long as I don't have this credibility I cannot register my formula as Brew install Astra but if you want to give me an end everybody go to github.com and star it watch it and forget yeah watch it it give me a stuff and the more star I get there the better I can register my formulas grow installers yeah yeah and then melro you'll be able to run Brew install all you want after that yeah but yeah I'm with you I I really enjoy the Brewing Style oh it looks like um sangria is having an issue with a database still in a pending status oh it can it can take uh yeah a bit of time so I've imported uh both of the file the table is booked by ID so I can probably just uh not during the time you are importing just do ask how DB secure sh workshops because this time because I did not provide any SQL command or SQL file I will enter interactive mode so here I can say describe tables I should see all the table for all the key space we want to use better reads and I want to see what insta uh book by ID table let's see uh book by ID but you know what we know there is Alpha million stuff there so let's limit five okay uh what did I do uh select star yeah the issue is in between the keyboard and the chair okay here we go um that's funny okay yeah hey and for more like the same the same uh feature that I did remember I messaged you yesterday I'm like create.env that's awesome yeah he just basically said the same thing yeah you're just you're just right in tune with what everybody needs there see seems like uh you know I hate my own dog food and so there you go yeah okay um all right the database is ready uh now let's uh dig into the application okay so we are working with a Java application it's a maven application if I open the the pump so it's better reads web app DVDs and if you look at the Palm uh here we are using Java 11 and the spring boot 2.5 it's this repo is not yet updated to Spring boot 3. again coming soon but as of now it's still Java 11 2.x we are using spring boot starters so for security for the view having a user interface without react using some uh spring and UI extra magic like the login button or to clients spring data Cassandra we are connecting to casana web flux I will explain in a minute web tool and a lot a lot of magic so this is the poem but I want to tell you a few words on how a Java application is supposed to connect to customer because today it's a spring boot app but if I ask you to do it with quarky's Micronaut uh active profile or whatever um you know you how do you do and it's it's similar so that that deserves a bit of attention I've got an active database uh so you will have time to to catch up because I'm opening a bit of a slide here that's excellent yeah so if I go back to the architecture previously of the workshop I downloaded them on open Library I transformed the text file do some CSV and we all together import those CSV in casino I also tell you that we are using a spring boot app and we have a created a spring boot app with start.spring.io actually and you have you see the what the pump look like for the app to connect to Cassandra we will use the Java Cassandra drivers it's a library that is used by Spring Quakers Micronaut and any Java application that connect to customer um maybe there are some old Java drivers but I think now you know 99 in use is the that sx1 it's open source and what do you expect from a drivers it's like a gdbc drivers you expect that thing to connect you to the database to speak the technical binary language with the database and expose you some interfaces easy enough to connect execute some queries and pass the result I mean this is all you ask and if on top of it you can do paging else check and you don't even ask a thing you don't even need to think about a what if one node goes down how do I fall back to the remaining nodes well the driver is clever enough to do the else check and the connection pooling retry and load balancing policies so before when I show you a Cassandra with a lot of nodes I told you the data is replicated if I lose a node the dataist is working well the drivers are clever enough if you lose one now there is nothing to do the driver will use the remaining nodes and start executing queries there foreign you should never notice that yeah so it's pretty powerful drivers um but here we are using uh Astra DB right and if you are uh intermediate to advanced level you might think hey so you guys probably did not expose uh a binary Port over internet and you are right or security reason we cannot really open any binary socket there and there so we need there are some proxy uh there and the road balancer so to connect to uh Astra look to connect to Castle High local we just need to provide the IP of a node it will find out what are all the nodes in the cluster and do the magic for you but because it's here in the cloud you need to a little bit more security you need to open a tunnel two ways TLS connection between you and um and this is where finally you can still do the load balancing l-shek and and be balanced and retry policy it's actually a TCP connection and for the routing is it's using a protocol called Sni now now you know everything but long story short to connect to this cloud system you need a zip file and in the zip that we call a secure bundle and in this video file you will have all the certificate needed to open a two-way TLS connection but do not worry we have tools and solution and framework to help you uh initiate that connection okay so the drivers connect to the database okay so far so good is just easy stuff easy stuff but you as a spring developer uh you may never have heard about the customer drivers you are using uh a layer on top of it providing the spring called Spring data the idea of spring data is having a repository with the traditional method save and entity find all the entities find an entity by its ID uh search from entities based on criteria and this repository interface has been then implemented for multiple technology you have spring data GPA for a relational spring data ready spring data Castle spring data elasticsearch spring data and a lot of that now it's it's it's working it's powerful it's great now even without starting giving you the details you need to understand that because it's an abstraction on top of everything you cannot do everything in Spring data level because it's uh it's like a converging effort to have the more abstract function as possible but when you need to dig into details and do some fine grain stuff you need to go back to drivers and it would be the same with the quachus session or a Micronaut Castle so spring data working as an interface doing the object mapping for you you create an object you annotate the object matching the color in your table and it's magic so if I show you a little bit of code because I cannot wait to show you some code let's say the book by ID table that we had before so here I first create my book by ID object I say okay it's going to the table uh book by ID over here and here is the colored book name book description bleach date and I doing the mapping on the color name to the Java attribute name and I just provide the type and this object is really now a record of my table and I create another interface called Book Repository extending Cassandra repository we are provided what is the object what is this primary key and here is just a an identifier okay and with that look at that it's empty right it's total empty there is nothing in there but when I want to use this book repository for instance it's the controller so here the controller is a view controller it's coding for the book details and when you connect to that page using the book and the book ID it will use the Book Repository and say find by ID so if I connect to the URL and we will start the app very soon if I go to slash book slash a book ID under the hood I'm using the repo signed by ID providing the book ID connecting to Castle Rock for us it's so easy the only thing you want to do is create an object not the object with the database and wow it also can create the schema for us so in the configuration file here there is some spring data keys that you can say say hey if you say creative not exist when the application start it will create the object so the cql script that we executed before to be honest we did not need it but it's not a good practice to let spring data create the object for you because you can it will work for development alignment for sure but there are some settings at the table creation levels that you want to delegate to your admin operators SRE some technical features something called like the compaction strategy the default TTL and some parameters that might change depending on the environment you are and I always uh advise people to create their SQL that script to create the table and make it validated by your SRE before going into production it's a real danger to use spring data for that it's powerful and sometimes to be honest too powerful because you know it's it's it's not providing all the details yeah that's a great Point Cedric that that yeah a lot of the times when I I see folks having a hard time with putting schema out into a cluster it's because they're trying to do it from with inside an application um so yeah I completely agree that yeah if you do that outside of that you know kind of in batch on your own you know have your SRE or dbre look at it and do it you know that's that's a happier path yeah yeah totally also here on this slide and I stay a few minutes on this slide on purpose there is something in red here when you create a repo when you test it the first method you try is find all or select star from a table and that's human because this method is the one that does not need any parameters and this is the one you want to do and you do that in development happy path because you just created the table you just created the the schema you are doing in Dev super happy about it but remember Cassandra has been designed to Save A Lot massive amount of data and find all is really like doing select stuff from a table so best case scenario you will end up in a Timeout because it makes two uh too much time transfer worst case scenario you blow out of memory because you asked for 3 million rows in your memory so please avoid find all in your code it will even be you know in in my opinion it we would even you know make a warning in the ID if you are using that second part in red is a low filtering so I explained about the methodology of how to build a good data model with custom you shape your table based on your query what is in your workloads should be your key you got it right but sometimes the business days come back with the new need a new request on the same data set and it's super tempting to reuse the same bin and the same repository to execute another query judge sending the workloads and Cassandra by Design will tell you whoa you are doing a select on something that is not the key and for that to work you need to add these yellow filtering keywords and then Cassandra will then be a low as the name stated to go and look for your data on every single node of your cluster this is what we call a full scan cluster again working super good in depth but what's his prediction with thousand notes this Ricket this request can take minutes maybe so because spring data is hey this is an object I use the repo it will generate my tablets but I don't care and I will use the code you are attempting to reuse the same bin for multiple queries you eat the limit and you allow filtering but a low filtering is really really a bad practice so bad practice that in the latest version of kasonga 4.1 you can disable a low filtering as a all hold the guardrail so be careful so what what do you need to do then if the business come with another need on the same data you create another bin which could be exactly the same as before but it's not pointing to the same table and the key is probably not the same and this is how things work foreign a lot of questions on stack Overflow regarding Castle driver and spring data and those are coming back very frequently so spring data leveraging the drivers we're good with that okay um looking at the time uh and then we can look more at more code um I told you that to do the search I'm using an HTTP API in open Library solution so you might ask what is the good way to invoke an HTTP in point in the spring ecosystem we used to have rest template spark of spring web but now it's deprecated and I think to be honest it's not deprecated for uh two years replaced by web client um and you might think yeah but spring web client is part of the reactive part of a spring and should you use that or stick to rest template and now it has been discussed in many ways on blog posts it's a no-brainer move to the web client because the web client offer you some asynchronous and non-blocking code and it's implemented especially the client's back pressure so if your client cannot keep up with the answer the client can slow down for for you to digest the flow of the incoming data so yeah even if it's written reactive in the name or you know it's reactive that's really really what the spring team wants you to do and so for connecting to open Library we are using the web client and that's part of the search so if I look again at the code and try to see for the search so the search controller okay and swiring on slash search we'll actually use a web client interacting with the rest open Library endpoint and doing the full text search so before we had a question that hey did you implement a full search customized not mean to to do full search so to have the capability I'm invoking the just public open Library API because we're supposed to have a copy of the data set and uh here you have a sample to use the web client in it will return the mono so a mono is the equivalent of a computation future in the asynchronous world but here everything we do is synchronous because uh we are using spring web so to make the call blocking I simply add dot block so it's not a problem to mix match uh both now it it used to be you know it just yeah it used to be problematic like anything that's blocking in your app if there is reactive in there will make spring fail but they changed that because the web client is so useful that you still want to leverage it now that's cool yeah uh and here then it's uh more you know modern Java you know somebody I mean when I'm looking at that code I say oh I I could have done better uh but you know still you stream on the results uh you map and you in the end you simply populate the object in the view and return the object in the view yeah um okay so with that now it's time for you to start the app come on um so moving back here this time on gitbot because uh I want to be exactly in the same position as you okay so now starting with big two application setup um so with the Astra CLI we have used a token we have used a database ID we have it a couple of things under the hood if you do asked how DB list you you might see that your database uh got an identifier got a region you also have the token all those attributes need to be the inputs of your Java application and you remember we also need the cloud secure vendor that zip file that eventually you could download from the Astra user interface but we have the CLI so we have better things to do so first if you want it just the secure bundle you say Astra DB download secure bundle workshops uh Dash F uh scp.zip so here what I'm saying is oh you need the cloud secure bundle hey download the cloud cqbender and here is it it's about 12K and it can be downloaded as simple as that and could be very handy if you are not using uh the same stack as us very easy to to do it but we are in Spring and if I open the from fight again and let me find the bomb uh you see that we are using something called Astra spring boot starter so engineering team has been up to create a starter so a starter in Spring boom is really something that based on things that has been found in the class pass will create some bins for you this is what the spring boot starter security is doing spring boot time leap is doing um based on what in the class passes we intensive bin for you that you can use in your app same thing for spring boot starter if you go to the repo and open the application.yaml you will see a bunch of keys so the spring Keys as stated before so spring application the name spring data we will come back to Spring Security in a moment and also here you have some keys for Astra and it's coming from the Astra spring boot starter and here you can ask the spring boot starter to download the SCB for you it will download SCB putting in a temporary file via the the the the project to your code and it's working and for these keys so you need a token you need a database ID you need a region well here it is set up to use environment variables so how do how to create those environment variables well again uh we did some stuff for you so if I find back my terminal my reason why terminal where are you uh terminal terminal terminal terminal activities okay here are my terminals um I can say oh I need to use that database called Workshop so Astra DB create dot off so dot off is the file with variable that you can use in your app that of uh workshops and I think I want to specify that I want to use better reads because eventually you can have multiple um a key space in your app so let's see and it will create a DOT on file which look like this and the token the API endpoint the uh all settings are there and because they are there you can simply what we call Source the file and when we Source the file don't know how to copy paste now uh if you Source the file all those keys will be part of the environment variables and when I do off I list all the environment and I grip and you see here in red that now all those keys are available so when I start the app it will use all those variable as inputs setup application.jaml using the the starter and voila it should work like that you didn't have to code everything has been set up you don't you didn't have to change the config file because of the of the clients so now finger cross that's a nice way to set it and says maven bring boot run here we go and I got a nice big fade so let's see why okay let me open the terminal and see what's wrong with it uh no plugin fan spring boot oh yeah it's it's ah it's blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah I show you that spring Dash boot well it should be there right uh and oh look at that I'm not in the proper folder well that would do it yes I I'm still at the root of the repo and my web app is called better reads you know it could have totally me fat finger thing you know I [Laughter] once in the proper folder and because you follow the steps at home and I do not you will you will make it work without uh issue I've done that before too yeah yeah I'm a bit uh yeah off-road here um okay so it's starting it should open a new tab oh yeah I got a a warning that uh no no no a load a pop-up okay if it's not that P I'm going to Port then I clicking the first link okay so the app open right now okay here we go and here I can look for the same title as before uh I'd like to copy that and here I'm connecting to open library with the HTTP look at that it's so much faster than my laptop and I can here click on view books and uh here it is but once there I'm I cannot go forward I cannot right now log into GitHub I get this ugly error and uh login we are uh I'll get this uh ugly error so now comes the time to uh go with Spring Security and it will be more you know the demo mode rather than uh you know you doing the the ends on it it can be tricky to to set up uh Google cloud and and GitHub but hey long story short look look at what I'm doing so I'm going to gcp so the Google Cloud console here Google Cloud platform and uh you can create an account for free uh again so no no nothing to pay in that Workshop so what you can do is create a new project uh uh live better reads okay let's do live better reads and you create your app okay so the the project is creating uh uh I could have called it better rich demo app so I select my project okay it's a totally new project uh empty and here I am live better reads so in this empty project because I want to use Google authentication I will work through the API so I will go to API and services okay and there I will enable apis so here I'm clicking on enable API but look at that it's really a step-by-step here okay so here I'm looking for API I looking for Gmail Gmail API and Google analytics but it's I don't think you need both but it's uh it's okay to to do both as as explained here uh yes so really I'm moving fast but it's really uh clicking clicking exactly how it's uh outsetting here I selecting the API and this is my output yeah so far so good and I'm doing the same with Google Analytics so I'm going back here I enabling here uh Google analytics API okay uh finding Google analytics API enabling Google analytics API and here it is so now I have an empty project with those two apis enabled what do I do next well I will click on oauth consent screen so this is where the Spring Security magic happen you want to allow some external folks to authenticate to your app so better reads will be the the the app we want to authenticate so here I'm going to external and I say create so app name uh live better reads a support email and let's put my application logo I don't need it application domain I don't need it and I can simply oh I again need an email address but should not be too difficult seven continue okay other remove scope I will take the the three first cut which has which are the authentication username for email user info profile and open ID we are in an open ID uh in an open ID flow I update i7 continue I can save and continue and summary okay back to dashboard okay I just feel the consent low and now I need credential user and password so I will go to credentials over here so 2.3.h and I will create credentials client ID so it's a web app as stated name web clients I would say gitbod you know like that and okay so now is really really where you need to slow down take a deep breath and populate it properly so there are two URL to provides the first is called Java creep origin where the requests are coming from the request is coming from gitpod here what is the URL the real is actually this one the one we are using right now right the this is where the coming uh the request coming from when we try to login how do we get this URL so you can copy paste from the here but there is a a handy command line that you you can you can use opening a new terminal which is GP URL 880 why because the app is running on 880. and here this is what you need to provide as origin this is where the request is coming from okay the second is okay you will open a pop-up when Google will ask you for your authentication if the authentication is correct the what we call the principal so the username and and the the context stated that the user authentication is valid need to be redirected to the app so you need a redirect URI and this one uh the way we provided we configure the app using Spring Security is our app slash login or to code Google but here I give you a little command to execute to get exactly what's needed to be populated and if you pay attention just you know passing by the first URL is https and the second URL is http so no need to tell you it took a while to debug it okay and what this work is done I can actually provide client ID Clan Secrets a client ID so to populate those I'm opening application.com.tml which is the the file where everything happened and here I can populate client ID o it seems like I committed my client ID client secret before so you know that's totally on me uh no problem okay next time I wasn't going to say anything alive yeah yeah and client secret here it is okay uh now that this work is done maybe I would restart the app yeah just to be sure uh but if I'm not mistaken now we can authenticate with Google and it will ask for uh an app called what's the name uh lives better reads okay let's see uh okay the app is starting we know that and now I try to log in with Google oh yeah so SimCity is happy I'm authenticating and look at that so it worked uh yeah so hey cool I'm authenticated with uh Google you know using that um and and for GitHub same uh principle uh but now you going to your GitHub account you create a O2 application so uh github.com okay here I go so yeah github.com all right 2.4 so here going in my organizations looking for oot developer settings at the very bottom or apps and see that I already have one I can create a new one but I can also reuse that one okay to to be honest um let's create a new one okay live better reads is uh that okay it's not started yet but we know it's it stopped uh okay so uh here this is the home page URL uh blah blah blah and uh the Callback URL if you go here see it's uh GP URL blah blah same as before but slash login slash two slash code slash key Tab and this time again it's HTTP not https did I provide a a code for that maybe I should so let's see okay um all right Register App so far so good uh update new logo you know what I can uh still put my little guy here um all right and now let's create a new client ID client Secret here it is so my client ID is that GitHub client ID and my uh 10 secret is that client secrets I save I go I start my app and finger cross I can also now Auto ticket with with GitHub it's it's really some settings at uh GitHub and and Google level and less in the app even if in the app I will show you how to do it so I'm already uh signing why because uh Google authentication I've put some cookie in my brother so I will log out and now I will try to log in again but this time with GitHub so I will connect with GitHub and look at that so now I have my little guy uh who wants to let me connect so live better reads and I authorized and this time I'm authenticated uh but on GitHub so cool as a matter of fact because I've used the same email address on GitHub and and Google if I authenticate with one and put some books and an auto ticket with the others I find my books they should match up that's right that's right yeah um okay so that's settings but what about the code what about your code well we use sim we in the pump we use spring boot starter security okay that's one thing second thing we created a bin called security adapter uh almost done yeah yeah five minute then we're going to the game uh so security adapter which is a web security adapter where this is exactly you say okay so um anything should be authenticated this is the so with O2 and you put the O2 Library there um to make that happen so security adapter so we saw the drivers spring data the controllers spring web client Spring Security the last piece we did not touch at all was the web UI so when you create a web UI with spring you use the controller for those we saw what the controller look like so you just say it's a controller and not a rest controller you still provide the mapping like it was a rest API but it's instead of returning an object where you are returning just a string the string is the name of the view where you want to go there is a view template enzyme powered by time leaf and if you look in the three in your project you can go to templates and here you will see some HTML file exactly matching the string return so here I written string book so if I open the book.html over here you see this is how it's uh it's populated this is how the view is rendered so remember in the book controller we populated an object called user books so we should find in the view something to Loop over this variable and display what are the books so here in the form there is a form here to add some books but I also probably have here um what is the name of the that thing let me find out where is that guy so here it is uh userbook.star date userbook.complicdates uh here it is oh and by the way to authenticate here you come back with O2 authorization GitHub and go to authorization Google and so you invoke requests with your control with your um Repository you inject the repository in the controller you get some information from the data source and you populate a bin and the bin will be in the model once it is in the model The View can render anything in the model this is how you pass parameters in between the backend and The View last piece of the UI that I have not discussed is in each View you can reuse some part of the screen it's like a react component so in Spring boot time Leaf it's called fragment and so in each page you saw at each time uh if I log in with GitHub okay let's go if I log in first I got the header then I got the search bar and then again something else so the header and the search bar are two fragments of my Hub and if I show here I do have the navbar fragments and the search panel fragment and if you look at components main so here it is and look for a fragment and here you see how the object can be reused so I was aware of this mechanism before react lately I also learned the react and I can totally do the the matching correlation fragment or kind of reacts components okay five minutes left we cover a lot I I you know I told you in the beginning that it was a lot of content and uh that I would speed up in the end uh but um at least you have the code all the explanation and you can make this app working on your laptop if I going back to slide not much to say we explain you the time Leaf the spring MVC Spring Security we connected to GitHub and uh and Google and it it made more sense to show that everything in one go instead of going back to slide uh so the what's remaining is uh let's have some some a little bit of fun if you want on the last five minutes uh we will play a little game uh if you don't want to play the game right away uh remember if you want to get the badge and Link it in go to the very bottom of the readme follow the steps which is just doing a screenshot of your running app and also also we told you we want to make customer famous and next uh months March 14th um there is a custom graph forward where the customer project member we'll talk about everything what's new and there we will have even such a famous speaker then Aaron will be there as well [Laughter] oh that's funny no I'm not famous ah you are you are so here is the link uh dts6.io yeah please register we need to you know to to be very uh we need to have a lot of people there uh but with that okay let's play the little game with five question uh before uh closing for today and so to play the little game go back to the tab you open in the very beginning called mentee uh enter the code three seven nine three four two oh one so I see that 12 people are there ready to play with us I think I I only have five question it will be quick uh but still it's a good way to see your name on screen and be famous yeah I'll trigger mentee through nightbot so that can uh to chat too yeah I can also show back the QR code I don't think we are hiding the QR code so uh okay okay don't want to wait for too much uh let's be on time and uh let's play yep sounds good so question one what was the most used framework today and answer faster to get more points yes exactly it was all about Java I was speaking I don't know uh react and uh I talked about react like the five last minutes uh but it was to trick everyone and you know just put some Spotlight on those who really attend the work session so uh let's see do we have a leather board okay look at that so joao pava was the fastest you know what this guy will keep rising and Rising with a name like that we see him all the time all right question number two uh look at your phone the question will shock there first there is a bit of delay with YouTube which spring data Cassandra which one should you avoid Cassandra repository operation SQL session find all spring data wet we did cover that yeah so nine people like before so yeah we have some serious player with us today that's right I see what I just told you custom learner bam here you go fastest now uh yeah so names that we we saw on chat yo so thank you for staying with us up to the end question three in time Leaf how a code reusable code section fragments components views or layer yep I cannot trick you that's really fragment as I stated at the variant oh it could have been tricky I know I know and NG now take the lead wow so it's tough it's tough question four thanks for fast to get more points how it's called a single sign now notification we use today GWT or two open ID connects HTTP basic or just Google this one could be tricky yes but most of them are correctly excellent so you are the best okay last question for today and for first to get more points which database did we use oh this should be an easy one gcp postgresql Cassandra known everything was in memory laughs and what an ending right I think we did our work properly today as Aaron right I think so yeah so yeah well that was all you you know yeah I just provided the the color commentary okay and and uh Javi is our winner for today congratulations um hope you enjoyed the session uh we try that to be interactive we would like to keep improving so we just open uh can I do have that or not uh yeah here it is um what should we do to improve our Workshop I don't need to stay on that screen we could watch that later but anyway it was all the content for today uh to stay in touch with us this call we are there 24 7. uh answering your question there uh once the YouTube live stopped we told you about academita datastacks.com to learn about casanov to learn about what's new what would be the workshop in two weeks datastacks.com Workshop but I can give you a spoiler blockchain and uh yeah if you stay with us up to the end uh please subscribe to the channel make it grow like the like the video this is how you made us famous and we can come back every two weeks yeah and remember sign up for Cassandra Ford that's a lot for yeah please please please and with that that's a wrap up almost some time thank you everyone for coming and uh yeah I hope to see you in two weeks all right thanks everyone bye bye [Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music]",
