    "text": "[Music] foreign Welcome to our weekly podcast on real-time Ai and Java with myself and Aaron and then of course today we have special guests too but first uh we'll we'll kind of do some housekeeping so yes Aaron yes hey thanks Mary it's uh it's great to be back uh sorry we we had a little bit of a week off there you know um you know in the US we don't get many holidays but uh you know when we do we we got to take advantage of them right so I agree I agree that was truly Labor Day weekend restaurants but but hey today we have uh we have Cedric on with us uh Cedric how you doing I'm doing great I'm so happy to be with you I've been watching the all the episodes so I'm thinking about I've catch up I know what's ml in uh real-time AI should be awesome yeah yeah so very nice yeah so wonderful so yeah we can have Cedric and introduce himself a little in here and uh then yeah then we can let's see and then you can feel free to run the show there Cedric yeah sure so so hi everybody if you have been on this YouTube channel you probably know me now so on developer Advocate I've done a lot of workshop with you all and I'm ready ready happy to be back to talk about AIML and if you know me I'm also super happy to show that you can do everything with Java so without further Ado I will uh start sharing my screen uh ask everyone if you you see my screen and I will do a little demo or and talk about what you can do now with Java um all the materials are available to you we will share the link in the description below it's a GitHub repo the code and material everything is there okay so what I would like you to demo today is um actually something called retrieve augmented generation so full generative AI I want to ask a question to chat GPT and chat GPT to answer me but in the question I will add my own data just chat GPT is boring I would like to insert some data in my own database and when the response come back I have context coming from this database so to do this little demo uh you need IDE environment this is what you find in the middle I will use my own laptop but everything has been set up for you to run in git or gitbot so nothing to install we will need open AI so the chat DPT guy we will ask him to do the chat completion request like you do with web the web the web UI on chat GPT and also another API called the embeddings API that will help create the vector and on the on the other side we have our database okay so to set up this environment first you need to ask her account so here in the uh readme you have everything you need to First create an account going to askthehat.data stacks.com signing either with GitHub or Google and once you are in the UI uh you just have to go quickly to settings on the top uh left hand corner click token management select uh organization administrator over here and click generate token and so with that you will get a UI with the token in front of you and the key we are using is actually the token the token is really your API key and you can do everything with that key especially because we set privilege of organization 11. okay all right so if you have done things uh okay so you open gitpod then the CLI is read is there for you and you can go directly go Astra hog and you should be able to see that you are already connected to your organization if you're not connected ask her set up token and provide the token you just copy in the UI and you should be ready to go and with that you can immediately start creating a database to do our demo within that database so you will be Astra DB create and see the command is over there for you ask how DB create demo gen AI which is the name of the database Dash K Genai which is the name of the key space dash dash Vector to make sure that Vector capability what we are demoing today is enable and dash dash if not exist to avoid any error so you can create a vector database right from the command line like that that's pretty cool and it's new so if you're not in dot four of the Astra CLI yeah please upgrade um and once you once the command is is done you can do ask how DB list and you will see that the database is there I did that already to gain some time and you can see here the last is demo gen AI Deploy on gcp and these little checkbox means that it's a vector database uh so here are another comment to describe what the database look like but you know we'll set with that you have your Astra account you have your Astra database ready to go there is no table no data in there yet but uh we will under the other guys first open AI okay so let's go um so you know to use the chat GPT API and so open AI platform under the hood you go to open AI platform um so I think it's uh it's something like uh platform.openai.com you sign in either with GitHub or Gmail sounds familiar and you end up in that UI then on the top right hand corner click on your uh click here on your name and you should be able to see a page how could view API keys you create a new key and same as before you copy the value of the key then what I ask you to do is Define these online this key as environment variables so copy paste then replace your key for privacy reason I will I will not show you my key but assume that this key is there on my environment okay so if I'm uh coming back here let me go back to the slide so here we have now the vector database running we have an open AI account and an API to start using the key um so it's a Java project no surprise actually the spin is Spring Book 3 project and I created it using the act the Astra type so not reinvent the wheel use the archetype add the dependency to vector and you're good to go so if I want to show you what the code looked like before running the test one by one so here I'm on my IDE I um in my perm I've added ask her SDK I also added the open AI client it's not only to create a client to interact with open AI there are multiple libraries available for you so um open AI Java this one the one reference on the openai platform you can also use something called open AI 4J those two are clients wrapping the open AI rest API there was a an open AI for Jay that's is that new yeah it's it's uh I think there are also multiple I've seen others people just generating their own clients specification right yep so this app is using the the SDK so um you buy providing some environment variables we will be able to connect to the proper database and for the generative AI here I set up a few Keys one is which model do we want to use so for create the embeddings we are using a model called text embedding Ada 2 and for the chat completion hey no surprise chat GPT GPT 3.5 turbo and um so open AI each each llm model you are using has its own Dimension so in the demo you did previously uh on this session around you you have 11 or 14 Vector size dimension to show you exactly what's happened in the vector real life llm are using Dimension like uh you know 1536 vertex AI using 768 so it's it's it's pretty big so with that I'm able to uh uh instantiate the open AI client using the environment variable and I'm able to instantiate something called Vector table so it's coming from the SDK and it will provide me all the method I want to use to interact with my vector namely doing search and my second table is very very basic just the main spring boot so now what I will show you if I will execute one by one some unit test and show you what it is so first I want to validate that I can connect so Astra client SQL session our object that allow me to connect so I want to execute should be connected test and so here each time I give you the command to run so here I go I run the command on my terminal and see if I can connect to my database so you see the log that's coming and here we go success all right second I want to test if my uh I want to test if I actually can connect to a pen AI so to see if I can connect to a pen AI I want to run that flow let me make it bigger for everyone to run I want to to have some a sentence like Hello World use my open AI Java talk to open ai's rest API server to vectorize build me a vector out of this sentence this operation is called create embeddings because a vector is also a name bidding per se so the output should be a vector and I should log my Vector in the console so to do that I have here dedicated unit test so I importing my openai client see very basic and I will call the method called create embeddings and I provide two sentences this is a sentence this is a second sentence so let's run that and see what we have so here I have should create embeddings right so copy go here clear face here we go let me go here and if it's okay we are good because on one end we can connect with an AI create vectors and on the other end we have a database empty ready to have vector so what do we need to do now we need to populate the database if you wish and to do it we will use this time this flow so instead of getting the output in the console I will give the output to my Vector table for my Vector table to save it it's simple as that and instead of providing just a a string I give a Json document and here we go so here I have a first method called ingest document that we Loop over the entry on my Json so Json is here okay it's a quotes from philosopher so I'm looping and for each code I'm invoking Vector table dot put and it is as stupid as that so it it ran it take it take one minute or so to run uh but I already have run that command so my database is populated my table is populated so I can show you what it look likes by going asked how to be I should have that somewhere I just had to be secret research here okay to show you uh what it's then AI demo remote hahaha live demos always happens see I can prepare but even the you know nevertheless and so if I select uh maybe okay start from philosopher which is the name of the table we choose together limit one just to see what it looked like so the vector is super long it has been computed for me but here we also have an ID we have the text that have been picked from the G Zone and we have used some metadata because in the G Zone we were able to say who wrote this code I put it here as a Auto nice all right so Cedric which version of the Astra CLI are you using I see I thought I updated mine but I I still get all kinds of weird characters when I try to select a vector column okay so I'm I'm using 0.4 uh uh reaction uh you know sometimes you need to uh delete a repo on uh here so you should not ask but uh if you go here to the Eden repo Astra here there is a a folder called SQL sh Astra that's the secret message that is download from the repo oh sure sure if that folder already exists will not be replaced but then it doesn't do it right if you dump these if we download the new version good tip good tip thank you the same for this book by the way because you want to load uh stuff um okay and you know um now my table is populated right so I should be able to run search similarity search search based on vector and uh here this is what I do have I have a couple of search and which is cool it's the vector table do we do we need All For You Vector table provide a method that is similarity search where you provide the text you are looking for the uh how many record you want and the metadata so here if I go here and show you the similarity uh sketch function Cit search so if based on what you provide in the query I will build the proper uh the proper select but for for doing a vector comparison I still need to take the sentence you provide as an input and transform it as a vector and to do it I redo exactly the same that we just did if you look at this method it's very very basic I'm using again the embeddings coming from open AI so here compute open aim buildings so you give me a string I ask open AI to give me the associated vector and I put the vector is my in my query and then I just ask V table dot similarity search and it will create all the Cassandra and all the magic for things to happen and here I have a couple for you in that uh test I have the default search which is just search code I have search code adding the author I have search code adding a tag you can also add a threshold let's say you won't always something about 0.8 very very similar uh stuff I need you know this is for you to put how close you want to be to your result so if I put if I pick any of those and you know for sake of time maybe I should just take one randomly let's say a filter by author okay this one and here you will just execute the test compute the vector and execute the similarity search and this similarity search is the same that Aaron did in the previous session it's just using cql selected by an an and you provide the vector now is this one using a a cosine based index or did you you go with DOT product or which one did you use here here I'm using dot product oh cool um but I think uh using the default uh similarity it's a cosine uh sinus is is is good enough yeah actually if you go to uh the similarity search here you can see that this is on you to provide which distance you want and uh the similarity Matrix here you have dot product cosine and euclidean so pick what you want but the the framework uh any but uh it seems like cosine is the the go-to the more performance are there other um methods or mechanism to besides cosine and the uh the the dot product I guess yeah there are other like additional way of doing this other than this yeah so um you know you think about Vector has uh think about two dimension in fact I I'm just real mathematic Vector with Dimension right so if you want to compute the distance in between those vectors you can go with the uh um dot product which is in mathematics called L1 you can go with L2 which is the square root of the difference of the coordinate to that square uh you can compute the cosine it's all the mathematical formula that you can use to to to to to calculate yeah the distance in between two vectors uh here in Castro as of now we have three dot Vector of euclidean which is L1 I think so no ecl2 the product is L1 and cosine is cosine yeah um but there there are more you can probably come up with your own dice in distance if you want to but it will not be available these are the ones yet okay yeah yeah okay um the last piece I have for you today was uh now that based on something you are able to retrieve something very close well well you can ask the system to say okay I would like you to generate now generate some codes as is it was Niche or as is it was plateau what you will do is you say Okay so this this is um uh here let me go here and find the latest so here instead of providing a text I will just ask you hey can you now generate a quote with the same way to speech as niche dealing with politics and virtue that's pretty cool because now he will do the stuff so uh first things first we are uh looking for in the database for codes coming from Niche that used to uh talk about politics and virtue and now we will go in in and ask chat GPT okay generate me a code that is similar to all the contacts you provide and for that you are using this time the chat completion API the second one so if I go here and here now what we are doing is um so now you you ask what you what you want to do so first thing the Astra vector will fetch from the database all the existing codes that look like what you want to do it's your context retrieve augmented context and then it will ask open AI Java client to ask the chat completion API to generate to code but not out of the blue generate code coming from Niche and this is four samples of Niche quotation so please respect that way of thinking that way of talking when you give me back the response and if I want to run that demo because it's pretty cool I will shut that find the quote over here and go to the very bottom which is please generate me uh some quotes with rag and here we go okay okay so actually generate four because we ask for so all these four is what Niche could have said about politics and virtue so and with that the the full thing we did ingesting document similarity search and creating something new ask something new to judge GPT providing a context nice well that's awesome very nice yes thank you let me um let me put your uh your GitHub repo on the on the Twitter there that uh that way people can find that um I I tell you I'm definitely going to go ahead and go ahead and walk through that myself this was uh it's pretty awesome yeah definitely and it's just the beginning uh I you know as our viewer can tell Java is lagging behind uh regarding to python so that stuff it's mainly Python and they are you know running in front of of us and most of the time people does not really use the embeddings in chat completion request apis directly yeah they are leveraging a third party framework and viewers might be aware of that it's a famous name like Lang chain llama index semantic piano it says from Google there are plenty and so um what us what we what we need is actually you should be able to use a strawberry flank chain boom yeah so use long chain as you regularly do and now is Astra uh populating what's needed for you and so we did that first in Python it's a framework called Casio so you can go to casio.org and see that we have different things a lot with long chain for chat completion from templating memory chat semantic cash what you've seen here is Astra SDK Java Vector I'm reusing totally the same concept so okay I did it with Java but all the brain power I think came in the first place from Stefano latini from data Stacks to actually build the casa framework so him in a way I'm porting and maybe reviewing challenging because there is a lot of Cassandra data model involved under the hood yeah yeah very cool yeah that's wonderful yeah and you know so maybe in a future episode I can come back and show you now that the Java stack is also integrated with launching maybe that's right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Cedric we'll definitely have you back in um you know for uh for another episode for sure yeah yeah I know there's I know there's so much you wanted to show us but we only have yeah we only have so much time I mean it's a lot it's a lot you know now you can go back and look at open AI look at what is this you search try try out see what's yeah you need to learn that step by step definitively that's right yeah yeah wonderful yes and then um before we go just wanted to share with everybody because Cedric also brought up the use of extra our extra database which has Vector capability sorry this seems to be a little blocking numbers yeah you look in into your screen yet there's a in the middle there that's our QR code if you want to register with Astra that's 25 per month uh US dollar uh for free no need to give you a credit card so that's very nice so yeah all right so and uh I'll just untied so we can see Cedric again so yeah um yeah so of course as Thai is free to use up to 80 million queries a bonds open AI that I show you is free to use uh up to nine 18 bucks but for 30 days after that is there like a rate limit on that for the free time right yes I'm trying to remember how that works uh I yeah it's it's hard to tell I yeah yeah really I'm not sure I'm not sure I you know I went into the paid stuff pretty quick because only paid customer could access the most performant uh model like right before that's right so yeah I'm on the paid tier maybe also why I didn't share my key in the first place right you don't want anyone stealing that yeah yeah awesome yeah okay all right yeah well Cedric this has been great thank you so much thank you it's always great to be back yeah awesome yeah thank you have a great day everybody yeah and now happy coding happy chat GPS is that is that a verb stuff hey thanks everyone foreign",
