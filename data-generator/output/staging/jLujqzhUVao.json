welcome hello hello okay so how it looks can you see us everything is fine yeah definitely let us know in the chat yeah if you can hear us and everything looks good yeah but at least hi PR at my side it looks good so we should be fine yeah same here I see I see a good stream myself in YouTube good I see all fine from Matt 102 43x perfect hi Pali yeah I see some familiar faces that's cool yeah that's always amazing to see familiar faces but new faces are very well welcomed as well and that's data Stacks Monday learning the great day to start a week to upgrade yourself and learn something new and that's Alex volv directly from Kaiser slauter Germany and with me David gelardi from s David very Orlando Florida in the United States of America I'm very curious about how many kilometers or maybe miles if it's more comfortable for you uh between two of us it should be a lot jeez it's many thousands yes it's a good amount yeah it's you know I need to take a plane or a big you know a boat for a while to get there one of the yeah definitely uh and we have people at this course joining us from all our the Earth so I've seen over 25 or maybe 30 different countries in the registration form I see people from I don't know um Italy Brazil United States of course a lot of people from Europe um and India and so on and so forth that's amazing okay so we don't want to wait for too long and let us start because today we are going to cover very important thing and if you just joined us and don't know what's going on in general here that's Docker containers from Basics and to best practices course course which should have been uh just uh four weeks but due to high demand and as you push it so hard on my boss and to our team we decided to extend that to the uh fifth week and it's going to be introduction to kubernetes so what a great news we extended that to just one more week and we will cover kubernetes as well due to high demand um important thing please share V use like all we workshops before we built one uh over the first one over previews and kubernetes things and best practices in general Workshop um more or less stand alone so you can completely invite your friends who are already into Docker but want to improve the knowledge and who is not so much into a kubernetes for example we are going to do um kubernetes Workshop a really handson so you will work a lot with kubernetes it's the best way to learn any new technology good so what comes next just before we start that's exciting how many people we have this course so even registration is keeps growing although we're in the middle uh but still people are joining us and that's great you are never too late we are always ready to answer your questions and of that's like the number which even scares me a bit you know David we have overall more than 2,000 hours overall watch time you know I got to say Alex like when we do these and depending on the amount of folks I've that numbers after every one of these sessions are always just kind of a little bit amazing to me because to think that cumulatively you have all these folks that spend time with us and it'll tell you like how many days like there was one one session we do did that literally the number of people on and everything it accounted like half a year of watch time and it was just like oh wow so I I hope that the material is you know well worth it that's for sure because we're spending lots of time with everybody here uh we are really happy what you trust us the most essential resource you have because well time that what matters even more than money and we want to say thank you if I just calculated out of curiosity if one person would watch those workshops alone it would take 83 days uh to watch it uh 2,000 hours so that's incredible okay let's raise those numbers a little bit but first of all thank you so much and uh we are starting and that's going to be week two uh week three sorry already week free application development with doer so we discussed a lot of things uh before how doer works why you may need that but now the thing we have to cover is how exactly do you develop applications uh with Docker as soon as you start to use doer you may found out what some things uh just Chang it in comparison with how uh you were developing things before and that's for a real reason because well there are some changes and I can tell you out of all the docker popularity in the world a lot of companies teams projects still using it very I wouldn't say wrong but well it could be us it in a better way so Docker needs some new tools and Docker needs some n knowledge and it all starts from the very beginning imagine a new developer coming into the new project and getting ready to work and first thing he or she would like to do is obviously just start the application um not even developing that it may take some time to prepare read some documentation and so on but just make it running and check if it works if I can log in if if I can I don't know uh use this application in general and in the company I was working before so no names but it's a absolutely real story I told it to you last week U preparation and running first Lounge of a complex system at the developer's laptop took around two work days so around uh 16 working hours and that's just incredible so first thing I want to tell you and first goal you want to reach doing the things with Docker don't forget the deployment should be a question of a minutes maximum to run your new application as we finish it with a continuation starting application on a completely new machine uh was usually around 10 12 15 minutes depending on network conditions because we some really heavy doer images in wolet but it at least wasn't 16 hours so um that should be a question of minutes to run and up on an any new Docker ready machine machine and simple reproducible environment is the key to successful development there should be two Commons to run your application on a new machine get clone Docker compose up there are some cases you may need to have a little bit more but at least it should be two three four five maximum simple operations if it takes longer than something is wrong in the setup and you want to avoid that and that's what always matters like it should be ready to scale horizontally very quickly one thing to consider speaking of application development is it monor repo or poly repo uh this concept came when microservices start to take over the world and uh what's the poly repo what monor repo and why it matters for us speaking about Docker very easy to explain like we used it to work with uh monor repository it was the times we were using monolitic applications so you have everything I don't know web part mobile part all the services and libraries together within the single uh git repository and poly rapper is when you working with application um like speaking of microservices which consists of multiple moving parts and you have one uh repository peran service and peran library and now your team works not with a single git repo but with many of them what's the difference and why should we care uh then we have monor repo it's very easy to decide okay that's our monor I'm writing doer compose yam file right here because it's for one and only place and I'm launching at here and everything is fine uh if you are switching to poly rapper first of all mono is not so bad even for microservices but we aren't talking about them today we will speak about them later at the data stack Monday learning but not today then it may be a question like where exactly I should put my Docker compost how I start running project uh using um my Docker compost yaml files or maybe I need multiple of them should I have one Docker compose per every of my repositories or something like that then different approaches and technically we utilize both uh so that's the thing to show for example uh have you heard of kill of killer video David I sure hope so yeah I know because if I have it at this point then it might be problematic for writing part of it but yeah yes yes I'm familiar with killer video so uh for those of you who don't know that's our reference application we used to show how we work with Apache Cassandra and data stack Enterprise it's pretty distributed big application uh with different Services working together and different backends back end we have backends on Java C no JS python whatever and that's po repo as you could see so we have separate killer video Java uh killer video C nodejs and so on and so forth and there are more repositor is here downstairs so how do we unite that all together we just as we are having already a lot of rappers plus one minus one doesn't really matter and here we go with first method for poly rapper projects uh call it um well it's there are different options I stick to allinone some companies call it Main and so on and so forth but that's not a question of a name because it consists basically of one main file doer compos which describes how all this application works together and some more additions um we will discuss later during the day and there are some sweet kubernetes definitions we again will cover uh in two weeks later I promise so and here in those Docker compose we describe all the application and how it's supposed to work by default so how do you run killer video you do git clone killer video allinone doer compost up and it's set and that's basically a very simple thing and that's how your application should be running so I'm kind of curious actually for those in the chat uh how many of you are using monor Ros and how many of you are using poly repos I'm really really curious very good question uh so you know what uh after uh I was originally using monor repos of course I mean uh as all of us when we start to use uh service oriented architecture and we switch to PO repon and I can say what if I would do it again now I would do it in moner even distribu yes yes you see what's the biggest problem of the monor raer and Po polyer in comparison with monor repon what what's uh git all about git is all about changes and changes management uh so uh if you are doing your G commit and you have a ticket in jira you write in your G commit message ticket number 1552 and then following the git history we can see who did that when it was done which ticket it was related and so on git is about managing changes change sets and uh very often you don't do just a single change so very often one of your change uh relates to another and you are changing the way how service a communicates with service B and if it's a monor rapper and you're services will store it together even if they run isolated one from another from completely different machines with kubernetes all over the world that doesn't matter so um with monor repo you can set a single change set which relates to each other and uh you see how this change is managed and with polyer there is no way to make a cross link on these uh change sets so you basically um have no direct relation uh between them and it may happen for example and it happened for many companies what we release service a version 2 which requires service B version to but as there is no way to link directly their versions for example and change sets using using G of okay R some dependencies management but still there is a fat chance what they will not relate directly to each other and you will have ver service a version two requires service B version two which is not deployed an application is not operational by itself both parts are parts are operational but they are not operational afterward so uh now I think what monor repo is uh for many cases will be a very good decision but that's we aren't speaking about G flows we are speaking about Dockers so let us move on and I see people monor rapper polyer monor so monor is not bad by per se uh just consider some limitations of both monor and polyer we will discuss it later if you would like to but not today so okay that's our intermediate repository killer video Allin one and we have those Docker composers here and we have also a bunch of applications which make this application working together so I explained what's the difference between moner and polyer and why spoking a poly rapper you may have a special rapper for your doer compose and to manage but there is a second way which you may like more and again there is no correct and wrong but something what fits better uh to your case if we go to killer video Java which is one of the backend parts of a killer video we may find Docker compos here is well and moreover we can find two of them we have doer compose C and doer compose yaml um why and what's the difference so uh the main doer compose is initially the main one is all in one is uh designed to just have your application running within two clicks and this Docker compos Y is already for those who are going to work with the back end and if we open it here we see immediately so what for example instead uh okay wait a second ah I changed it locally already so in in we can easily switch from uh image version to build version and uh next version of the file we are speaking here is doer compose CI as you could guess relates to continuous integration we cover later today and it's simplified version before before for because for continuous integration tests I don't need to have web frontend for example and I don't need to have uh many other services so when I run continuous integration tests all I need is uh this local image of killer video Java local um I will show how it works soon I will need database because those are integration tests those require really database and configuration uh image which well doesn't interesting for which is not interesting for us right now hey Alex before you get too far on this there's a question in YouTube from aonso uh when we were talking about the mono and poce what happens with the storage in these cases is it added according to the work environment yes so uh very clear then I just want to run application there are no volumes and there is nothing special like this because I just want to run it and if then I go to change something I'm bit surprised that it's not uh committed to this file so let me show you oops that's something very oh that's wrong at all sorry I launch it wrong up and actually this question is answer it exactly on the next slide well thank you Alano for playing straight person being a little bit ahead of the uh time that's uh very fine I love questions like yes so uh and if I switch to my Java thing so we will work with the same application hey code could you please start okay so we have doer compose here and then I'm going to work with the application I'm doing very simple thing I have first to command out image because I'm not going to uh well in some cases it may not required like if you never change what what's going on not now and in some cases that's not required and I can keep using image but I prefer to switch to build and then I specify where to build and I'm going to build local folder because I'm currently located in the um killer video Java part uh if you use uh all in one approach puff will be different and then I have to set up a volume volumes so just to be clear so you're you're essentially using the build within your Dock and compose in lie of having a pre-built image so this way as you're making changes locally or whatever you're working on your code every time you run this you're going to rebuild and then use that image nope no way I I uh so you are running ahead of time as well of course I don't want to restart it every time a stop Yes um okay I did it in the wrong part I started to fix front end I may need working with back end sorry so I'm going to wipe out this one Dam on and we will need uh volumes and I'm uh mounting local folder to it's going to be what was it opt um killer video Java and uh speaking of about slides that's exactly the next slide source code I will not even open it and the way how we do it so the easiest way for us to pass through um the local changes and the files we are changing locally to a container is a bind Mount if you remember week two that's exactly the point we discussed you bind Mount that and you have all your changes and uh that's the very simple change set we have to do we need to switch to build which is let's say in general recommended so you will see how it works and you can rebuild it if required you don't have to rebuild image in general so that's to be shown soon and oh my God uh and hopefully prali uh matter of fact peral asked the very question what's the difference between a pending build an image it it looks like you're addressing it right now so hopefully you're going to get the answer to so you remember uh Docker compost is just a configuration file which tells to Docker what to do like what do we want to have in the end so build means what I will instead of using permanent image with Docker run pull an image I will build image right here before using that so that's for Docker build and the volumes I'm mounting that to use uh local folder in the op killer video Java um folder of a container and then finally we can go on do the next part and add some environment specific data so uh did I answer the question I hope difference between appending Bel build image um yeah so I hope I've yeah PR let us know if you have any file questions that or if that answered what you were curious about good uh so good then swich me back to my browser please okay yeah paral say yes good uh so okay so we have now our doer compost file which describes all our system we are going to run it may be something simple like WordPress plus MySQL we did last week it also can be very very complex like something with huge oh my God I just stopped you stop bugging me sorry hey there is my browser oh we get to see Alex's desktop what's on there it's a very rare case uh usually no one sees my uh desktop okay so uh we have have the docker compos describing our system we we add build and volumes instructions to a Docker compos to specify we are going not use existing image but we are going to use to to build that when required again you do not have to rebuild image every time you do any changes it's easier than that Docker is to simplify development not to make it harder if it would be harder I would not talk to you right now uh and we Mount bind Mount volumes to uh have our code inside the container then some more things to discuss environment specific data what's the environment specific data by itself very easy to say it's something what changes from environment to environment and what do I mean by environment that's your laptop my laptop that's our production server and that's our testing server and you don't want your production server database password to be available on any laptop of any developer of your team uh except of if it's a team of one but usually it's a little bit bigger so you have to treat environment specific data specially so there are some things Chang it and we have to take care of them very properly and first thing do not keep sensitive data in sour code I really seen some people keeping these production database passwords in git in source code and that's a very bad idea as long as you put something under gate there probably um very soon a lot of people who have shouldn't have access to this data will have access to this data do not keep sensitive data in source code never now uh on the example of the right we see this part of a killer video one of a killer video Services killer video generator uh if you would watch to our code we use environment variable killer video API key set your YouTube key here if it is it good or is it not so good let's think well so uh YouTube key is not stored publicly here that's already something very well but uh there is a problem for example someone working with this application will really put the YouTube key there of course because well that's how generator works it needs connection with YouTube and then uh doing a huge change set developer may forget uh to remove the essential sensitive Data before pushing it to git and boom We again have YouTube Key push it to a git and that's again wrong so is there a way to improve that yes for reason and that's why we are here for now that's a much better way using environment files in this case code on the right is exactly the same like it was before except of the environment directive in on doer compos yam file we have this and file the only what Chang it is we move it our environment variables to file call it def. NF and that's the file I need a pointer and that's the file dev. n we are having right now and all my variables are here and this file is under git ignore that means what it will not it doesn't belong to G and will be never deliver it there please notice you're protecting yourself right as an application developer you're protecting yourself to ensure that these environment variables are the the values are never going to end up in the other systems exactly thank yeah that's a good notice and you know what I consider myself as a very disciplined developer I'm always doing reviewing my own change set before at least pushing them and usually before um committing them but you know what in once more than 15 years it happened once or twice I was pushing things I would not push and I checking things very strongly so I do think it may happen with everyone even you control yourself all the time in this approach how many how many of you uh watching us right now have totally either wiped out data or taking down a system give us a thumbs up and if you did it because of environment variables it's okay we're not recording these We're Not Gonna you know let let the world know yeah I've definitely had a couple yeah definitely so this way we protect ourselves local setup is in dev. uh everything super protected key is in d.f and dev. N is in G ignore wherefore it's not seen it will not be uh committed and push it to a rep by mistake and you are protected and the only missing thing here is what def. n well therefore you have to F somehow because it will when you do a git clone file will be not delivered in this case what we uh do we have file def. an. default with some default settings which may be enough maybe not enough and we have in the instructions in readme for the project and you have readme do you at least you should and then where it's how to run the project get clone uh copy paste Def and default to Def n change the value and boom you are done you can run a doer compose up notice one thing which is a very common mistake people use it uh copying value from um yam file people use it to have it like Dash space key name uh double Point space valum and with n files it works differently just name and equal sign with no spaces and immediately value and that's a very common mistake people forgot to rework it like that it looks more like Linux environment variables file because cleaner too Tech technically it is and finally is is the a even easier yes and no so watch the last example of this part uh we have this uh file with uh no things uh defined at all and we have do- n uh environment files which will be passed and which may be used directly in the environment things and you don't have to Define them in the docker compose uh and that's an obvious way how it works so the case when convention is always is more V configuration personally I don't use that because although it works and in some use cases it may be convenient with with default. n file which is magically populated to a Docker compos file with environment variables it's um special case which personally I don't like uh there is a question in chat that um is it possible to use public or private Keys encryption with doer compos files uh so um I'm not sure what Ur I'm not sure exactly what do you mean um encryption and signing of images exists but definitely out of scope for today uh maybe I misunderstood the question but anyway let us move on if we want to be on time now there is a um one thing that's not enough to define environment variables we also have to use them and as now we are not just using applications like we were using during those two classes but also developing them we have to work with environment variables in our application do you remember before at the workshop 2 I launched my SQL uh specifying my SQL root password and uh here it was so there is no no magic it was uh processed by Script um startup script and the myql container and use it properly and as we are configuring our applications via environment variables we also have to support them so there are a lot of different applications languages and Frameworks uh suggesting it to do it in the different way and if you would try to cover all main of them we are going to be done by tomorrow and uh I will cover only two main situ only two languages those I mention at the most during the last workshops Python and Java uh but any modern language provides the tools to work with environment variables so I hope you so I hope you will be able to find required Tools in our ke here and the first example we are using Python and we are defining function that's a copy paste of killer video pyth and back end uh which is taking um the environment variables um giv by their name with os. get n and the name and uh down and here a little bit down uh the same but using some default settings uh which we will cover in a moment for Java it's mostly the same but we are using system. get NF and specifying values what we need if key Keys what we need to grab if we don't specify the keys we will grab all the list of environment variables available for these application now that's uh at least for me very important thing is uh developer experience uh what is developer experience we don't speak about way years of developer experience in the in this case but more like you know uix user experience in general how convenient for a customer for a client to use your application so we should remember uh the DX DX developer experience is how convenient for a developer to develop your application and that's really important because people always forget about us developers so we should at least uh take care of each other and what we want to see here I'm always trying to add default variables most commonly used variables so when you don't want to uh specify something and just want to run default mostly us it variables will be defined already uh with those default values like here and I don't need uh to do too much environment variable definitions in order to launch the application I just want to launch that it makes my work easier you know Alex by the way a followup to the question from Arthur with regard to is it possible to use public and private Keys encryption with do compose um then he followed up with likey and Putty for example um and Aban offit said maybe he's asking to ecrypt the docker compose file I'm I'm wondering yeah I'm also wondering where that applies because I'm thinking where I'd use them for putty right if I was using public private Keys uh for the actual connection to the to the other system uh that I'm trying to say SSH into or something um I'm also kind of missing what we're encrypt in that question yes I I still I'm sorry I still don't understand if they are trying to connect one container to another then there is no point for encryption because they're in the same network and this network is considered protected and if you are using uh it in production with have hundreds of servers and you want to set some trust between Services when you will not going to use doer compose anyway because there are some better approaches to handle uh multihost um dog do systems like kubernetes we will cover two weeks later so I will be very happy to proceed with this discussion about encryption uh but in Discord better after the workshop yes so we have to move on now getting to build and run and that's very important to understand what build and run are two different processes and that's very important to remember so first of all like a typical situation I've seen by people developing Who start to develop with doer uh hey David are you with me it looks like we have an issue with connection to David but stream goes well hey David okay okay I will try to proceed alone uh can you hear me everything is fine hello everyone hello oh great great to have you back or great to have me back I'm not sure who sure which one of us went back or whatever yeah but well doesn't matter uh we can proceed anyway so uh thing I wanted to say I've seen really people rebuilding Docker container every time they uh do have to change something and that's of course completely wrong so built and run processes will be very different for different applications that's um like we have a compilable applications uh with Java and we have interpreted language like python or many other languages and approach is different but in general in most cases um in in all cases or almost all cases maybe you don't have to rebuild or uh even restart containers actually because very often just restart process will be completely enough in if we work with interpretable interpretable oh my God that's like really a p.m already sorry so if you work with languages like python with interpreter then the only first point is to deliver code to The Container but it's delivered already because we need this bind Mount earlier today you remember and then after that we simply can restart that so the easiest way to restart the W container will be Docker restart another option will be just to restart the process within the container which is also works very well uh second point which is a little bit harder for uh compilable languages so you have to compile uh obviously a new jar file it may be a question for example but uh that's all that's again doesn't require rebuild of the image per it depends on how exactly it's done um and important Point again here if we take a look at some um images I will show you right now uh you will see how many people are doing um Mistake by putting their run putting their build dependencies into runtime and there is a very huge difference build dependencies you need only on build and don't need that after that and runtime dependencies uh you need during the runtime and for example take a look at these shiny where is my browser um hey hey hey hey yeah perfect we have this killer video Java take a look at this Docker file here look how tiny it is isn't that great that's just like uh seven lines counting comments which is really like command uh it's very short and easy to understand we use official Java uh official jaama Java image we specify maintainers of this image which is technically um deprecated technique right now and we should do it differently so maintainer directive is deprecated we specify entry point so which particular comment container is going to run on Startup we expose the port for us it's Port 511 it's default uh port for backend service in killer video and finally we copy file uh which is going to be executed and that's interesting something about with Docker image if you think it's very small it's uh easy to read easy to build build it up considering this part changes nearly never it all comes from cache and copy file is also a question of half second let's say um so it's good or maybe not so good or at least maybe special I can tell you it's not self-sufficient Docker file so uh for it to work someone needs to have this file uh to be built and only then this file exists this Docker file will work and if it doesn't exist this Docker file will fail because there are no Source Target killer video Java jar and wherefore this thing is not sufficient and it's fine in this case because of the team conventions like uh people who developed this thing all have uh Java installed locally I do it differently I prefer not to pull my dependencies on my laptop because I'm working with dozens of different projects if I would pull all the languages and all the dependencies all the Frameworks uh Frameworks on my laptop it would be exploded in a couple of months so I keep everything think in Java and but I still can do the same when I use the approach of do two Docker images per project one Docker image to build having all the build dependencies and I run the build in this image and I receive this Java jar file in the end and then finally I uh just add it to a production image which I have right here and the this keeps this image pretty small because there are no build time dependencies great and uh if you want your image to be more self-sufficient and you just say Docker build and everything is done then maybe you will not like this uh file which I will show you now especially in comparison with the Javas onean smallest one if we take for example these guy while you're doing that um sorry Eddie's got a question on YouTube How would would you combine it with CI I will show you I will show you I will show you I love I love how all the questions that are coming in are ones are like it's in the next slide yeah yeah it's in the next slide well you see I'm developing with doer since let's say very uh early adoption of the doer in the world and basically I know what people are asking about so uh it's in the slides later so if we see Docker file for this killer video generator which is another backend service for a killer video it will look a little bit differently and uh let's uh walk a little bit through it and understand why it's this way so in comparison with the docker image you've seen before this image installs all the dependencies of in runtime and then get R gets rid of them in the very proper way so this one is a pretty old file so now uh it us note JS version 6 oh my God it was outdated like ages ago but it's still operational so let's take a look how it works and why it works exactly this way in general let's cover it in the next Workshop about best practices but there are some things to notice for us right now as well first of all in the note version 6 uh everything was launched with the root user Linux administrative user with no uh limits and no concept of permissions it just has full access out everything out everything over everything and we want to fix that so we are creating group and user for our killer video user which will be running this process we set default note n uh production environment so we def Define default environment uh variable note n production what does that mean if you want to run this image uh on development environment to have some uh out better output and traceability of er rors then you always can run it with the environment variable note and development and it will work well but if you forget to do that at all application will not fail because not n set it will simply running in production we are preparing some place to run this application so we will make directory op killer video generator and Chown it to our newly created killer video user and we also set this directory as a working directory when we copy two files package Json and npm Shing RB Json uh if you are into the JavaScript and no. JS programming you know what is it if you don't not really important that's just dependency management so package Jon defines which dependencies we are going to use and npm Shrink specifies uh the particular versions of these dependencies and finally these huge tremendous awful or maybe not so awful command uh which I really have to explain why it's done this way and why it's a best practice seriously uh I know how it looks like so first of all our killer video generator has some really uh heavy dependencies with comp dependencies we cannot simply make npm install because well it's going to be harder than that and we have to uh install some very special things and uh why don't we just say run upgate update run upgate install run npm install and so on so there is a little secret then Docker executes your Docker file directive every step is executed and a special container we uh run containers with the containers to run containers while running containers simple as that and as all your commands are executed in this temporary container it will be committed with have Docker commit command we never discussed it before and uh boom we have a next image and the trick is uh the those uh commits and those Docker layers they are about changes as well and if I do uh Docker run up get uh update Docker run up get install python uh Docker up get out to remove and remove where folders where those temporary um dependencies are store it in the end I will not have uh image as small as before but I will be I will have twice increased images because on the first change set I'm adding all the up get update things and on the second change set I removing them so uh it will be not as easy as it was before but twice heavier so uh if you do some temporary operations you want I just want to do npm install but to do that I need all those things python make and g++ where I want to uh install them make npm install and remove them and clean up all during the single run directive only this way my image will be still thin uh with all the Redundant dependencies not installed and that's pretty interesting then I copy my local code to this Skiller video generator thing with all the dependencies installed as well and finally I'm using interesting thing so you already know an an allows us to define environment variable like we did in the beginning with note and production but there is another thing which is called it arc Arc relates to build argument and I can inject environment variable if I would like to on the build run time so like we run Docker run- e or Docker compose environment we can include some environment variables on build time not on runtime why it's important in this case I want uh to have this andine and far Define it and built in into the image to simplify usage of that um yeah and the rest of the thing should be familiar to you I Define user so by which user I'm going to do the rest of the commands and the last comment will be CMD and run the my killer video generator uh getting back to a point that's pretty a lot of things say two things you have to remember build time and run time those are different first second um in some cases you want uh your uh Docker file to be self sustain self- sustained but in some cases it may be pretty hard and big in the end and at least if you are using this not obvious way so this doer file will not simply work added to a documentation uh so uh in order to execute and build this thing you need to have uh first compile the file and then it will be copied to a production image and you can do do it using your own local installation or you can use uh dedicated build image which will be used only to build thing it would be based on Maven as I say in this case but that's not our point because our great guys are doing that locally you've locally installed Maven and uh then so uh how do we run them as say as we bring any changes we uh and we did didn't change the main image thing like we didn't touch doer compos file we didn't file Docker we didn't touch doer file the only thing we have to do usually is just to restart for container if we speak about interpretable language if we speak about U compilable languages you will still need to have to compile the deliverable Alex we have a question from vrun in um in YouTube I think this is this is relevant to what we were just talking about where you were just talking about when we are running the command the way app get install part of shown no Docker file is does this mean all the commands run on different contains and then a combined container will be a resultant container where we'll run the app and create first of all thank you uh second of all almost so take a look uh we speak on a build time notice that's important we don't speak or speak on runtime but we speak on build time every every time in the beginning and in the end of every directive there will be an image and every command like run at least copy will be executed in a container temporary uh container which is used only to build for next image for example here we're downloading node 6.11 slim and that's an image when we have to run this comment how do we run this comment we run a container out of this image and do those commands and now we do Docker commit command which will create a new image based on uh container so now we have image which has base node 6.11 but we've group added and user added when we set this environment variable the same when we create a folder the same so every time new container is launched commment is executed and um finally container terminated and we have temporary image and in the very end we have final image you are working with and all the intermediate steps maybe clean it up if you don't need them anymore or uh use it for caching purposes cool so we discussed some things about building and running and now I've seen uh already few times when people have everything of their projects in Docker compose except of the application they are developing so we have databases in a doer compose we have uh some caching services in the doer compose uh and everything except of the application by itself that doing still locally and then there is a uh huge comp Le uh work around to make application running locally be able to conduct containers and vice versa because while they're using different networks your application running locally runs as a host process and containers are running using software defined Docker Network and that's not easy for them to work together and when I ask why people say like okay we cannot de overwise and we want to be efficient we want to debug our application normally using debugger and so on and so forth and answer is of course yes you should to be you should be efficient and debug your application with debugger but there is no need absolutely to run this application locally because you completely run any debug operations with application running in doer container so the back contain riset application is different but not hard and absolutely doable what changes we will need a port to connect uh so what's uh for many applications for many services the essence of it is to open a port and serve some request receive request dispatch response when we speak about web applications it's usually will be Port 80 when we speak about some another applications I don't know using grpc calls Port may be different like 50,000 like we are using in our case doesn't matter um and that's a port exposed by default but we will need a new Port one port for the API and one port for debugger to connect and uh port number changes from language to language and from debugger to debugger uh we will see a couple of examples soon and um also we need the service to run with debug enable it so service need to know what is being debugged over Dev it will not work and for compilable languages like Java you're mostly probably going to compile it with um Java debug options and finally we need a remote debugger session so speaking of java Java can can Java can connect to your to any Java virtual machine if it runs locally or if it runs on another host in our case uh remote Java virtual machine will be executed in the container and as Port is exposed like in this example example we expose Port uh 005 and we simply uh run debugger in the mode attached to remote Java virtual machine we've host Local Host and Port 5005 that's a port we open and when we run application we say to expose weport at the docker level over wport will be closed and at the application Level so your ID will know how to launch the application I cannot dedicate too much time uh speaking on how exactly it works for this language or for that language because again there are a lot of languages and we have many people here using different them so uh I want you to know where to go and where to search you can run remote debugging session completely and there are no problems in that speaking of that of that that's not only about a debug but also uh with some languages like noj maybe some others you may have so-called watch so your application has to be uh transpire it again and uh relaunch it if you change some local code and you can run uh Watcher in the watch mode uh for you not to push the button every time but simply watch her to do it for to do this job for you it perfectly works with Joker with uh doer as well exactly the same way so uh you need port exposit and you need Watcher understand how to restart the application gracefully and there is no need to rebuild the container there is no build need usually to rebuild the image that's a very simple native um manner so the very main thing you have to remember there is no need almost always there is no need to run your application locally and run dependencies stalker you can do all the work run them all in Docker and gives a huge benefit it all works in the simple dockerized environment in the same software defined Network and you don't need to set up any relations between the containers pass through the ports pass through things and do all the absolutely redundant job people are really doing over World in order to try to connect local locally running application to Joker uh to Docker just run everything in doer it works perfectly y good so I see the team working in the chat yes uh we have no M today my was working very bad on morning and uh I don't want to run into the station again we got with freezed m i uh promise you we will have a really great uh quiz maybe using mty maybe not but we will have a great mty in the end I mean uh after this series is done and by the way just to introduce you some people we have a great team working in the chat Betina David well you know David and Cedric answering your questions so thank you so much and now finally I heard some of you asked about continuous integration and continuous delivery and uh some people say well continuous integration and delivery is not exactly the development part it's kind of more to those devops Ops and I don't care and my answer is absolute complete no uh that's exactly the essence of the development and you shouldn't throw your coat over the wall now you guys go and take care of that no that's the ENT as long as your I just want to add that I'm gonna stand on the same Alex Sil boox right there I couldn't agree more yeah no that's really important that you you have cicd baked into your development process absolutely yep so uh as long as your court is not running running uh successfully on production your job is not done even after that it's not done but the main thing we we speak today is continuous integration and continuous delivery so uh when we speak about uh development with Docker usually we speak about multiple people working with multiple Services very often and uh one of the best ways to fail if you want to fail is to use local build so when I'm developing this killer video Java thing I do all the changes uh do uh Docker build Docker push and push final image into the docker Hub and everyone starts to use that that's a it may work once it may work uh twice but in the end it leads to a failure inevitably because uh local environment always affects local build and at one point it will happen I have something so it will even if I test everything it will work on my side but it will not work on your side because of some issues so we want every Docker build uh to be executed on remote machine fresh new with no uh local environment affecting that it's just a completely new virtual machine started or something uh some new environment first point second Point uh we recommend to stay lazy and use automated builds because it's actually saves a lot of developer time and efforts and let you be efficient more so AO build is absolutely um cool thing uh to do everything so uh continuous integration and continuous delivery usually done with build servers test servers and so on and there are many of them so there is a huge competition on this Market let's say there are some open source proprietary self hosted Cloud hosted yours not yours one you can make very complex things and one you can uh do um well let's say simpler things but they're easier to handle my personal preference here is Jenkins as it's open source I love open source and as with Jenkins I can launch uh rocket if you ask me to launch rocket Jenkins is one of the most powerful tools and I love it a lot from another point of view it's also pretty hard to master and that's definitely not the easiest thing uh to be successful with if you have no prior experience um one of the most famous uh build servers you may want to use speaking of op source for open source Alpha propriatary inside is Travis so if we go to um GitHub uh things for example for the same killer video Java and you see this build passing label I bet you've seen it many times on GitHub it means what our uh Travis uh successfully built last image for the master branch of this repository and I'm opening it right now as an example for today of a continuous integration I will use Travis and if we will have a little bit of time left I will use um GitHub actions but uh what's really important here I'm no way selling you uh Travis or uh GitHub actions or Jenkins they all have some pros and cons and you have to understand that for open-source Pro projects I'm very fine with tr is because it works well for um open source it's free and uh well that's very fine for me so I don't have to run my own server with Jenkins I have to run my own server and take care of the workers and so on and so forth so we have actually a long stack of failed builds here I'm very curious why but I want to show you one of the successful once um every line here is the job what Travis did for us due to my setup and how do I set up that very easy as we are in the killer video killer video Java repository we may take a look at the file do travis. yam located in the beginning that's the Travis configuration file and is this one is going to be pretty big one because we do some um sneaky set up for this uh Java killer video to be built and executed so it's a big one uh but there is no magic and I will explain you step by step and here following these instructions um Tavis build Skiller video Java for us and that's open source so you can completely go and watch how it works and uh free use it freely for open source so let's take a look at the configuration file first so there are some things those important to know Travis tries to uh improve uh developer experience and make it easier to run so if you say language Java it will do Maven install for you but if uh if uh Travis makes a maven install for me I cannot control it and I need some special configuration to make it instead of using Travis default configuration for Java I simply say language generic no language at all let me handle that I know what I'm doing and there are some minor things uh we will need sud sudo to install some things and we will need oh so we will need Services Docker uh to handle our things and uh we will need sud to handle uh service Docker as far as I know now it's not e needed anymore if you have Services Docker you don't need to Define suda but it was a thing some years ago and there are five more sections we have to take care script after success after failure failure n and notifications so what is the script script is the main thing Travis runs to Define if build is successful or broken and every step here matters except of Travis fault you may see a lot of Travis fault here that's just a decoration uh to easier to make logs reading easier so please just ignore everything what relates to Travis fault here that's uh not not the essential part so what happened in first during the build we are going to uh build this jar file do you remember in before I said what these killer video Java um Docker file is great except of a fact it's not just enough it needs this file to become compil it already so this uh Java jar file will be compiled during Maven install command and what we are doing here we are running official Maven image specifying working directory op killer video Java mounting local folder current folder as killer video Java we are doing command Maven install with some additional steps doesn't matter what's exactly as soon as this command is executed successfully and only successfully if it fails build will be stopped we do already build for our image and we do Docker build for our local Docker file taking that like killer video Java local and taging that with Travis commit what is Travis commit when I do a git commit it goes to Travis and this Travis commit environment variable is basically the G commit uh with this change set we are testing right now so I will be able to access this image with this identificator and also like just killer video Java local hey question for you real quick for this do we need to have M Maven installed or any steps to build Maven image also or any other dependency good question so take a look first of all always stick to official images instead of developing something on your own you will have to maintain stay lazy stay efficient uh we are using official Maven image to build that so this uh lonely word Maven that uh a little bit more powerful than it may look like because what's this Maven mean Maven means it means hub. do.com slash oh my God open yeah perfect May then that was proof that we all all expect everything instantaneously today yeah so that's the official Maven image and I don't have to install it as uh in this automated build you see we have language generic it means what we will here have just a plain Linux machine with nothing except of Docker installed and I'm using official Maven image uh to pull the to pull it and to do Maven install so it will be pulled from here and mostly probably it will be something like free uh six free Maven so what's one to what relates to latest I don't see the latest T so far but doesn't matter it's going to be something like that good uh so next step uh that's not enough to build image every monkey can build an image the question is to test that and if it's not ready to work don't send it to production and that's very important you don't want to push Docker to dockerhub or to your repository whatever you are using uh the changes you are not sure because the moment of Docker push uh by you and the moment of Docker pull by production server may bring the changes uh those are were not intended for production so it's very important to test everything first and here we have this yeah Alex real quick yeah sorry followup to that is um is there also any way to define our custom our own custom Docker repository the from yes absolutely uh so uh if you don't specify anything it will use the official one hub. do.com but you can also completely use your own repository uh on premises or you can use uh Google compute platform or AWS has also their own repo and so one and so forth so uh that's very easy uh to uh specify it looks like oh okay you will not see that um it the text will be too small uh okay I will use it like that how to use uh gcp Docker registry yeah so I will make it bigger and you will use that good question by the way I should have covered it last Workshop because well it's a pretty common case features features features features uh can you would be just D me an example okay I hope it's here H quick start yet yes yes yes yes yes I just need an example of a particular line we go oh my God okay yes so uh here we go what was the thing I was looking for uh when you are uh working with official Docker image like Maven you simply write Maven and it will be this part so it will be image name in this case that's Maven if you want to use particular version you set double point and say like version 3.5 or whatever you want to have uh if it's uh image or store it on the default Hub doer com but it's not um so kind of default one like not just Maven you may want to specify company for example uh project owner project ID when we speak um of uh killer video for example if you want to use killer video image you will pull them like that and here we have killer video generator so if you want to run Maven you will simply run Maven if you want to run killer video generator you will run killer video/ killer video generator now we add a company owner and finally if you want to use some specific registry we just add this register name in the beginning and add slash then owner then slash then uh name and then tag so uh if you use no registry and you ammit this part it will be used as Hub doc that's it good uh so any more questions we can proceed no you're good at the moment so uh now uh we start to think I really don't like because it's done wrong and moreover well not wrong per se but not optimal and it's done not optimal by me so there is a thing I should improve and maybe I will show you this Improvement next week I will do my best so uh we need to run tests and we have to run integration tests so it means what that's not a unit test whe are easy to run but we need depend Tendencies because integration test is about how your different systems working together and we go here with Docker compose specifying file Docker compost. c. yaml up minus D and which Services I want to run I want to run data Stacks Enterprise and I want to run data stack Enterprise config for killer video and then finally so that's fine there is no shame to do things like that but this is a shame because course that means what we have no health check to check if DC config is done already and we just sleep for 3 minutes and that's a bad practice and we shouldn't be doing that uh in general that should be about to sleep as long as the DC config is not done uh and or fail on timeout if job is not done within 3 minutes what's the point your builds usually are executed on chared environment and today are your neighbors AC quied and you have all the server for you and tomorrow everyone is building something and your build which would usually take like four minutes will take 7 minutes and this those slips are nonreliable and they bring a lot of um delay not required and specifically speaking uh false positives for example when uh application if it would not be ready in 180 seconds but 182 application will be consider de already by this time let's say uh when we run back end and back end uh from this doer compos yam file will'll use already this our image very good so sleep again make it start up and finally there is an just check if it survived lounge or not so uh that's in general not the things I will show you next week at the best practices because it's not PR best best practice but I want to execute command on the back end and I'm just echoing still alive what does that mean it means what if we managed to execute this command that means what container is running and operational and a little bit of Linux magic this double pipe set means literally or and if First Command fails when second comment will be executed overwise we proceed down so uh if someone you are not so much into Linux you may be a little bit scared of this thing don't worry or means if this one succeeds proceed down if this one failed do this part and in this part I simply write back and test down print out locks and exit one exit one any exit with nonzero exit code means what build failed and I will have red flock and there is something to fix and so Alex here's an interesting question again from Pali uh by the way thank you for the questions Pali instead of this script tag containing the whole set of steps one by one can we put them in a separate file and then include that here is that possible absolutely that's absolutely possible and moreover a lot of people consider that best practice um there are different approaches uh but yes uh it's very often executed just to separate file absolutely um yep so short answer is yes and finally we do Docker run killer video killer video integration tests which is Standalone projects running API level test to our running backend and I'm attaching it to the network killer video Java default because it's the network defined in this doer compos file by the doer compose and that's the final step if the last step exits with Code Zero we are good build successful success if it exits with code non zero it's something failed uh and uh build is r and we have something to check so we buil everything uh with dependencies we compile this jar file we uh put this file into our already almost production image we start integration test dependencies those are dependencies only for test uh as soon as everything is fine we start integration tests for them good and for last things to cover after success those are steps executed um in case of success and after failure those are steps executed in case of failure with failure everything is very easy I simply do Docker compose and print locks from DC confi and backend containers so I will will have them um in case of failure to see what happened why it's happen why it's broken I don't need to have these logs is everything is fine because well if tests are fine when I don't need some uh these well there are a lot of tests to execute so logs of those containers are going to be pretty long and after success so take a look we built an image uh we test an image now what do we have to do we have to push an image obviously but do we have to push it on every commit on every change answer is no uh it will just lead to redundant job for us for repository uh with no um real benefit out of that um my approach to build images on every git tag you don't usually write 200 texts per day if you earen Netflix let's say and uh also in case of a pool requests for some scenarios it will be a good approach in our case first two lines in after success they do very simple check first thing Travis event type so why this job why this build happen to be if the type is Crown so it was scheduled but not on Commit then I just uh write ignore nightly builds terminate I will not build image for nightly IM nightly build we just don't need that maybe you will need nightly build for images that's very fine when we do one more test if Travis Tech uh environment variable exist what's with Travis tag it will exist only if Travis works now with Git tag so we tag at this and this is a potential release if this if this environment variable does not exist then we have no tag and we have nothing to do again ignore non tag get builds terminate boom empty and if we not quit by after these two lines it means what it's not Cron job and it's Travis G so potential release and when he we go I set a tag to the image we built before do you remember here was Docker built- T Travis commit so Travis commit is the identificator of the image we just built okay so I do Docker tag to set a new tag I use this Tris commit as an identificator of the image and I set this image killer video killer video Java and set with stack uh which is defined in G so for example if I release something as where are my releases if I release something as version 301 or what whatever 34 like for this killer video generator for example in the end I oops wrong where I yes very well so in the end I will have image tag it 304 or whatever git tag you set then next line is just to log in to Docker Hub to be able to push the image and finally I'm pushing this image uh to the docker Hub with this stock so it will be available and final line explodes a lot of brains because there is a lot of dark um dark magic of uh bash and um git and Docker well mostly G and Bash and short answer and that's again a pretty good practice uh if I release uh you've seen it maybe at hub. do.com what then for example you work with mySQL you going to have version MySQL 554 but also you're going to have version 55 and you are going to just version five why it's done in some cases you as a user of a MySQL image want to have this particular version 554 Point like you that's the only one you agree to work with whatever your reason is I respect that so you are going to be able to set particular G teag and that's what we did already but in many use cases you don't want to stick too much to this version and you find if your system will just uh do at some point Docker pool and run next version if you want to stick to this uh minor version and to just to use 5.5 you can set this to be 5.5 and it will be updated in some cases and you don't have to worry about that and finally for some of the use cases you are completely fine with sticking just to Major version so you want to use mysq double point5 and that's very fine to you if it will grow higher than at some point it may be 58 15 for example that's exactly the things uh happen right now at first we check if our Tech is the latest tech uh in the repository and then finally we release this one as latest uh so it will be if you just want to use latest killer video Java without text 301 3 Z and so on uh you may stick just to Tech latest and use the tech latest so if this tag was the latest we will push it as a latest if it wasn't we will just quit and that's after success so Alex got a couple questions here in YouTube um the first one I think from Jey I think you're going to address here in a moment with regard to are the failure logs stored anywhere after the failure step okay so uh take a look um as I call them so why I love uh so much uh automated builds because they are traceable because if someone did a mistake I want to know who did the mistake and why the bad code was committed at all and then I have automated builds I can open every damn single line of this uh execution and see what was wrong when it was wrong and so on and so forth so all the co all the locks of every build is stored with build uh I wouldn't say forever but for a long time and I don't know what happened with this buil and why is broken but I can go and watch uh all the logs and what was broken with this build and find everything um and see it in any moment traceability so yes all logs are stored and available if you need them to investigate where exactly and how to address them depends on your build server for junkins it will be this way for team City it will be that way so there is no simple answer but that's the main idea and what was the second one okay then the other oh yeah the second one was will this versioning not already be handled by Maven or Maven Bill do we need to get tagged for this uh you see uh you may handle things uh with Maven as it is but again uh you let's say you have a doer image um double Point ABC how do you will uh track it anyhow relation to any Maven or Gtech or whatever and how it works together you will have to launch it pull it launch it and then see what's version specified in Maven for example uh so uh we recommend to seek to doer uh to get text just for a better visibility and then we can go and see uh all the Texs of this image hopefully if doer Hub listens to me yes and we see what we have Tech latest we have Tech 3 Z we have Tech free and they all are the same so 3E 04 is the same as free and fre zero and latest because it was the latest one good anything else no that's it for now thank you y I think and proning Je I think jeit we we got je the answer uh he was looking for and then finally okay he just said okay so I think we're good good very well so there are some more things to discuss so we discussed um build job by itself we discussed Docker file it may be big and may be small for others of our uh Docker files uh those will be much smaller but we have to proceed because we are pretty out of time and there are a couple of slides left to discuss and final things uh what happened to be I want to discuss just testing with you because Docker makes testing much easier if you use AO build and cicd really much easier uh before to run an application on a testing server it was a long uh job a lot of big scripts and so on and so forth now how to run your application on staging or testing server git clone doer compose up I love it the that's really great uh oh sorry one more slide before testing uh but that's the think we discussed it already uh git Tech should be equal to your Docker Tech or better to say Docker Tech should be equal to your gitte that's the only way uh to have parity in the versions and much easier control and overview on what's going on if uh by a reason it happens when uh these uh git Tech is done already but you don't want this image to be delivered yet because you have a complex system of tests for uh okay not unit but functional and to end tests and so on and you have to test it somehow but you don't want release the image to zero already because well it's kind of uh what was earlier an egg or a chicken uh to test an image you need to have it with the uh text and to when you have the image VI Tech and can already somehow go to production and you don't that as long as these uh image is not tested yet how do we solve that easiest way for us is to use Tex uh of a release candidate type so if I want to test some image uh if I want to see how it works I go with the tech for example 0 2.0 D rc1 for release candidate 1 and run the tests and I can release it as and uh after some runs if I'm fully satisfied I can release it not only as an release candidate one but also as a default image 2.0 which was fully tested and now I am fine to run it on production test it okay test it but how so you've just seen us doing some testing and the easiest thing to set up testing in some minutes literally minutes is smoke testing and that's the most underestimated kinds of testing very easy to implement still discovers a lot of issues you may say okay I have unit testing I don't need smoke testing no you do because even if your code is perfect even if your um unit tests are all green and they really works I mean not just green unit test tests like there were a lot of green unit tests on Titanic you know um the point is if the port is blocked if a port is closed your application will not work and you can have all the unit test green doesn't matter what so smoke testing literally is just plug it in into a power socket if it smokes something is wrong okay but how it relates to doer container very easily run your doer image and see if it after a couple of seconds or whatever your time out time to start up if it listens on Port you expected to be listening it's really easy really simple thing to implement and it already solves a lot of issues seriously so that's the thing you must have always even if you are running an absolutely crazy startup and you have no time for everything smoke testing is something you can do it's a question of 15 minutes launch it and watch if it runs on this port well then thing we use uh much more is functional testing or kind of that is API testing so what is every Docker container as it is it's a system which usually receives some interaction some input data from outside and dispatch some answer and uh functional testing is a kind of a quality assurance process when you don't care about the internals how it behaves internally what's language is it is and so on but what you care so where is the specification what I should give I give the input data and I receive results out of running service and I take it and compare if I give this service uh two and two I should have four in the end actually I have three in the end it looks like my uh famous summator who sums up uh the numbers works not so well and something is wrong and uh you may say it looks like a unit test to you but it isn't unit test you run at the very small code pieces level and the functional testing is a full functional testing on the API for example in our case for our functional testing we need uh database running behind the service functional testing is a bit slower than unit testing but it very very worth it so that's very important uh to have these kind of things on the API level running the calls and check comparing the results expected to actual at this point I will not give you any particular recommendations because there are dozens of languages and dozens of functional testing Frameworks and API level Frameworks but that's definitely something you have to re um investigate because it's the best way of the testing for Docker containers overall and finally we want to go to end to endend tests and uh some people may say selenium at this point and answer is well not exactly because selenium goes even further so it works like a real client it may open what your people may not push the button because this button is hidden by some overlay I want my test to be easier to write so I use things like protractor again not selling protractor there are some more things like Cypress and so on but my personal experience with protractor was pretty good and end to endend testing is the heaviest way to run because now you need your full application operative operational because because it will it should touch at least every part of your application but still um Define it as a code so for example protractor tests are really easy to read and before for us uh for all of the developers end to end testing wasn't so good thing because it's again about setting up all the environment for endtoend test and setting up the environment was hard and now again git clone Docker compos that's all what you need to do if you did your job right and that was basically the last slide yeah we speak of no squel bench and you can include no SEL bench to your tests as well because we not only want to test the uh systems uh behavior and response but also response time so stress test can completely be a part of your test strategy what's important to notice uh uh well stress testing is harder because uh you need to have some um servers guarantee dedicated for you because if you do stress testing on a shared uh server you will run all the time into a problem what today it's faster tomorrow it's slower not because of any of yours changes but because your neighbors uh are doing some job in the same Data Center and uh as I see no more questions we are ready to go for the week three assignment and that's great so uh week three assignment is a very heavy uses week 2 assignment so I have to remind what we did as a week two and we did a simple Docker compos thing application of multicontainer one pre-build uh one custom and we have to submit a new issue of the type week to assignment uh for other people to review your job and so on and uh two people did that Andrea and rato thank you so much for uh doing this that's great but I believe more people can do that and I kindly ask you to do that finally and you will have one more week to do that but now a little bit harder so first thing use the week two task one as a first step when improve it following these week steps you need to use environment variables to set up you need to use any kind of Travis build or GitHub actions I didn't cover it today but it's exactly the same um we need to have a little bit of test even smoke test will be completely enough please use our week two samples for the insiration where is you can just copy paste those and expand them that's already will be great so you're completely good to go with the uh with forking our uh sample application and improving that a little bit and adding automated test that's very fine and it will take you one hour to set it up I mean set up uh it will take uh 2 minutes and then some time to make the improvements if you can publish your code uh on GitHub and add it to our issues as I shown you right now so we will be able to uh watch that and review that I promised um to review those code submissions I will do but those two were submitted too late so I was not able to do it uh during the preparation for the week free and uh choose an issue take any of the uh Services uh submitted you've seen here at the issues of the repo uh there are specifications like where is the code how it works watch how it's done and do maybe some of your suggestions how would you improve that or maybe you will learned something from them that's already great and finally if you want us to review your assignment publicly send us an issue link to Meme and we will take care of it about the during the best practices step if you are able to do it in next few days overwise we will try to cover it somewhere well we will find the time and basically that's what it for today thank you so much for being with us amazing team and uh we are very happy you like it and we are very happy you stayed you stayed with us thank you David so much for your support it's always exciting to work with you and sounds great I think we are done I think so I don't see any other follow-up questions or anything and uh again I saw a lot of familiar faces and and great interaction coming in so we'll we'll see everybody next week thank you thank you so much and yes that's amazing thank you for the warm words that's great okay so it was Data stack Monday learning with David gelardi and Alex voln and we are always happy to make your Monday a little bit brighter see you again one week later",
