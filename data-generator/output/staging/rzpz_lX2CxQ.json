    "text": "eleven ten nine eight seven six five four three two one and well I'm live hello to another data stacks of catching the saundra and it is a surprise yes he seems sharp power power 60 minutes see sharp action but I have news a couple of news bits that I want to share with you you dear audience so the big thing here in the Seattle region crime at of in Seattle neighborhood called Ballard in downtown you know everybody have a good one have a good time there we all sit down town Reuter [Music] but amidst all that there is some other technical news so if we look over at screen here I'll bring that into focus right here at week well it just flew by I had it up why does Twitter do that so what I was gonna show you is okay I'll just Google within patchy cassandra 4.0 alpha has been released so let's see let's see how this is going here does google show you what's up oh this vlog that nope that doesn't have it so anyway oh there we go so 4.0 alpha is out you can go out there and you can do a bill and get it so if you go to let's you're down download it's on this page you can get all the old ones here but supers easiest way to get there well I guess this is gonna be another thing I had the link to the link but anyway the writing C sharp today not gonna do an actual Apache Cassandra book I just wanted to mention that it is out it has been released in alpha so testing is going as swimmingly with that over here though got to two things that are c-sharp related one is what we'll get into in a minute but also Jeff carpenter and I have been doing some C sharp slinging well mostly figuring out what we're gonna do for the killer video c-sharp repo this is a repo that is a reference application that we have built at data stacks that provides a lot of insight and examples and working examples generally speaking of how to use data stacks enterprise and the graph database analytics the search and the core Cassandra underlying bits and various things like that so there's a whole lot to it and we're going in and updating the build modernizing it and basically going to do some upgrading of various things but not on this session we're gonna get into the schema migration tool here in just a second but tune in on Friday that event will be posted under the events section of the data stacks devs channel very soon so keep an eye out for that and join us and we'll get some more killer video updates happening and you get to share with all our trials and tribulations for upgrading the killer video application so I enough that let's dig into back into with the Kassie schema migrator by starting with taking a look at a few of the issues where are we at here so logo that's for down the way that's that's not happening real soon refactor okay I actually did we get those things a while ago I'm actually Martin done and say close comment set documentation up for the application turned out puts for Mac OS Linux that user once to be able to store connection information locally if I'd done that oh no we'll look at that when we when we put together the CLI right now we're in the testing testing and development phase CQ file files the executed in order by the time user wants to head up and down table of history of migrations user wants to create an initial key space for use and migrations user once process ok so it looks like all that's in order we and we were in the middle of doing a lot of that so let's jump into the code boom which I already have open here and we'll get right wants to restart I updated a plugin so anyway let that restart for just a second and I will continue to describe where I'm at with all of these pieces of this application so the application is a schema migration tool that's gonna expand far beyond just Apache Cassandra and the core data stacks enterprise pieces and we'll get into graph elements analytics and other things that would meet schema or a collection of data types dictionary objects other things like that and we'll eventually include all those into the schema creation elements right now I am focused on primarily these schema migrator the core cql being executed in order as it should appropriately be executed and the correct record to write that various migrations occurred during all of this so it's here getting the in the tests up and running go scan is I think it's done all right so let's run the test and see where we were with all of the tests so go to unit tests here scroll it up a little bit take a look at all of the unit tests there we go and then we'll just run them then we can refresh our memory of where I've gotten to bow okay so here we have a a mismatch a mismatch input alter expecting in the fall oh I remember I remember exactly what I was thinking here in this particular situation I think what happened was if we go back take a look at the migrations we're using for this test just helpers and see I'm putting the patna cql in right we're writing it in here in the test Falls so we can completely control it and basically I'm doing a alter table right here and I'm adding a column and then semicolon the next one the next one the next one onward and onward right so let's do let's do this see where we get so let's see what it's cited here - yeah constant right sure let's try unit tests yeah No conflicts within pages they call oh because I haven't torn these things down I didn't write the drops to actually fix atreya a cool table unit test table etc so that should knock that back out and drop the key space so let's see let's see how that goes it's let's write a test for the down actually we're gonna we're gonna add it to this test because it needs to be part of the test actually so that we get a create and a teardown of the whole process which is really what's attempting to be tested here bar result equals migrations execute migrate dot migrate down okay then we need to assert dot true down results yes I know this is a this is not the best integration test this is more like I'm using these tests or it's not the best unit test I'm using these unit unit the unit testing framework to really do kind of an integration test that's what I'm doing all right so run this puppy let's see if I can run it with half of that stuff already built up I don't know if that's gonna work we'll find out the jiffy because I suspect that first well the first parts gonna break and then the second part should work mm-hmm we need the down migration actually run so let's do this this is this is not a good suggestion I'm gonna comment this out and run this to get it down migration and then after that theoretically runs successfully right haha okay so that says it ran successfully so we should be able to go up and migrate back down okay so I'm gonna run all the tests or run this test again I guess it's what I'm doing whoops and to go over here let's stop stop stop stop come on what are you doing I don't know what it's doing it's being crazy I think it might be stuck maybe stuck hmm so anyway while that sits there stuck I'm gonna actually try to close okay let me close it I'm just gonna open up JetBrains rider again and then we'll bounce back in there and run the test again it did not seem to be cooperating too well and just hung so you know standard develop a problem there come on there we go oh oh it's opens on the wrong window don't ask me why I do not know that's okay you no worries all right boom loading backup nyan cat hustling along get it done if you're wondering I have my lovely handkerchief coffee here lovely coffee here in Ballard and also have my own grown Portland you so you've ever had one of these sometimes they taste awful depending on your taste but I guarantee serious programmer beverage so look at that beautiful I want to run them again let's run all of them again I might run them two or three times just to see oh my God look at that it's beautiful we're getting migrations migrations are being executed y'all this is a major milestone major milestone you know what that means where's Twitter at where's Twitter at we're tweeting this we're tweeting a major milestone that's right [Applause] all right there you go y'all just getting to watch me make a tweet here because this is this is so epic I need some like rocket fire where's some rocket fire here explosion that's good Oh I've seen all I have Twitter signals here this is how I feel all right the next tweet and then I'm just going to do this see what kind of cool gets we got oh let's just let's agree yeah there we go always good to thread white into a tweet there we go all right oh man all right so another programmer skill do not get stuck on Twitter for too much of the time of the day so on that note hey thanks this text is for give me a shout-out all right Cassie schema migrator we got all the test running so our next step is really to start figuring out like how are we gonna wire all this stuff in the hooks just for the console because if we go to the console yeah if we just run that let's get out of here we just run that it's still unfortunately magically as it should be ajust a hello world app still we did all the work in the test and then build a core library so I think I have I even let's do this and let's add core library right boom alright so now it has got the capabilities of adding all the magic sauce from the core library caste core library where all our good stuff is right so now the catch here is let's here Cassie console so how do we just loser get up page there it is well let's now that I think about it how does it it builds it into dll I don't want to I don't oh yeah let's get the alright we need to look it as your pipelines here we go can we do a reserved so the next thing we need to do is we need to build we need to build this into its executable format so to do that yeah how to produce an exe for a house lactation just now but it's going at this diese an article by Neil bot this is from though it's 18 so this is yeah core console application let's let us quickly create an application check this out all right there we go that's what I want publish all wonder its writer me that we got debug here in a CPU default all tests edit configurations ncpad so it's said that Cassie consoles that so we got here not net executable that's probably what we want right let's let's go with that Exe path oh no that's executing an executable I want to do a build static method okay that was not helpful at all let's go look at this stuff I can't console them ah here we go okay I want to do this as a deploy oh did I do that for this is the debug and then release are there decoy for debug yeah we'll leave it for both all right so let's do let's do a release build so now so I'll just see console and object right you have this one a CD console how do you okay you do this you got that just gonna do it manually it's I don't know what the heck else to do I hear dotnet publish - C release I've done the core this year but I'm in their turn she's got a bow the run time from here okay gotten to publish se release our Linux got that deserts yes dressed oh when is it back only this is not very friendly I don't I don't need I don't need this to be done okay no I don't want to do that either figure to http generate exe just anymore here no it's just that okay for SDK what can I do it's a dive net and roll this up here this is SDKs it's not expect right there's a dotnet help dotnet publish [Applause] what Oh publish publish hmm pseudo all right we'll see see if this works here okay published mated directory debug I don't see I don't see an executable how do I make an executable all right here we go try on another thing that for fossil publish publish a deck or console ordinates so if you have to use the NATO winter but IPE one shouldn't use the api's and then here is this part console Apple and Linux I'd better cross went from half a dozen core self-contained down in core applications so maybe we'll do a little example here so I'm gonna pull that out of the way we're just gonna I'm gonna leave all that junk in there for the moment super framework dependent so if we do a framework dependent build it's basically gotten to publish that see please like that and that's gonna make that which should be in these so there's three for DLLs the DLL so let's do it is there such a thing as itself we got that got that publish - see you release then I got it done or when it's dark so here's the doc dot RR ID idea then target framework moniker doesn't say anything about where's already fine our ID runtime identifiers catalog look at that run towns so how do you get how to use our deeds I don't care about the graph I just want to know okay we're gonna go with this one at portable okay there's that okay so we're doing this one self-contained equals true so true no equal sign let's try that right finally okay there we go so that's how we build a build so I guess we need publish that sort deploy you know what let's go to we're gonna go into the actual build process and get that sorted because that's where it needs to be sorted right here in the animal okay so build and then pass holy legs that's cute or what it call it um Linux die deploy or console employ Linux and let's do new windows so we want to add two other RF IDs and we want to go with that command where is that's right shoot what did I just do with No [Music] others like to our IDs so that's pretty important all righty catalog and the published steps again that's four total - one is a go to to to now it bounces to that - one - o1x doesn't have three okay and then we needed self-contained screwed that was a command I issued yeah all right copy bringing the tank back up there how does command a shoot so I want to do this one this one would be the doctor and of course I blog this one all up there's a list somewhere so we'll do win 64 and then win-win 1064 Windows 10 Windows Server 2016 portable should be the key let's do Red Hat let's do the hobby I mean and then what the heck let's go back to highs here right why not because we can Chisholm Chisholm for it's lightweight distribution using puzzle-like alpine linux oh yeah definitely look that one let's get that in there I guess I could just add on whatever needs came up I just figured out what the heck is going on oh well okay so now that we got these done let's let's try to do each and every one of these bills just gonna copy em all in there and we'll paste every single one of them in but let's let's do from a standalone terminal here I'm going to list and then my stuff is there's first one second one I don't know if these will actually build on Linux I don't know the right pieces are there but you think that they had the pertinent pieces for that right included in the SDK or the framework that would kind of make sense but it might not it also might not make sense that have it done that way but it appears to be working which is super badass yeah that's super cool really really really super cool super cool rad stuff and last one Tyson oh that one broke alright well let's just leave Tyson off I don't now get back into writer here let's let's get all that stuff in there comment it out wait for it comment it out there okay so task the one for name delay X let's let's try that one out I don't need to be there snap that out of there let's get it I guess will do from the terminal since I don't know what's a shortcut key is you admit that is it and all these changes its master yet master branch okay good commit ready or deploy no that's what I'm do it now but let's hear analyzed s working in completing up-and-down migration push out out there and that's gonna go with the first Linux build so we'll see how that goes in just a second let's bounce into this go back over to get it up and in github let's see her get up get up get up we're yeah schema migrator uh-oh build fill that has reference format is well let's jump back in here try to figure out what we did oh it's doing it build against this thing maybe we just do a publish that works chuckle [Applause] make sure those are over there still and then put the script now let's put this up to this oh that's actually I should say got that blah blah let's try that we have about like a description Oh Pat to add to do that one at three [Applause] okay just second over oh shoot it needs to be in needs to be in a specific directory yes and just confused the the Jesus out of it on that one I guess let's try that I'm sorry by the way custom and I am working on some c-sharp stuff trying to get the build going for the different executables if you are still there sorry about that completely missed your your comment oh let's do it hello weird number okay well let's do that let's do this and we'll hear how do we I plan oh it's sign-in let's let's do that let's actually sign in see if we can't get this this thing sorted out that is working [Music] they need a reboot all that stuff right let's see that they got it's running at least on the bill oh that's weird num-num be in this mess so what is this I got [Music] turn whatever it's funny that everything you're trying to normal now Jesus they're both too that just for later all right how's this going here hey over there we got it we got a good one so let's actually flip to this back to 18 and see if we can do that okay mm-hmm okay I guess my 18:04 build is not gonna happen right now sorry we've got it done and working to the point where [Music] [Applause] reach these is mapping the OS and order is as follows one Linux x64 EV en distro / - this rose to Linux ESL or Alpine stro Windows 64 where they call portable not for than portable win 7 + think is how that goes and then for is Red Hat Linux x64 5 is let's X Mac OS and dot 14 and then 6 is working here while hobby this is 13 which is the previous distro right wasn't that what it was c-sharp Rd boy already getting pretty good at this finding this 'simply catalog thing what MACO exercises oh hi seer I hear okay [Applause] [Applause] alright so that is that's the description and that's it for today's episode do note that Friday I will be doing a see search c-sharp session with Jeff carpenter so join us this Friday we will be on 1 p.m. PST or PDT whatever call Pacific time zone that that's gonna be a pretty cool session because we're gonna dig in a killer video and we're gonna be getting into a number of like trying to refactor patterns down to more minimal patterns and just doing all sorts of kind of c-sharp specific stuff that should be a good one also what else is coming up there's a bunch of things coming up I'm gonna have another c-sharp session next week as planned on the old Wednesday 2:00 p.m. time slot so join me then and I will also be having a ton of thresh code general calamity on my own channel adrian hall where you can learn more about all the good data stacks bits the Apache Cassandra but also terraform Packer infrastructure is code configuration management and a whole host of other things in addition to just C sharp I also primarily do a whole lot of go programming JavaScript and other things like that so I hope you join me on my channel make sure to follow here on the data stacks devs channel and go follow me on the adrian hall channel I'll see you around so until next time happy coding cheerio [Music] [Music] you",
