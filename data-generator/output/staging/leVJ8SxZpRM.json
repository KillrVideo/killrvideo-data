    "text": "hi this is Jeff Carpenter and I'm David gilardi we are back with more talk about killer video and this time we want to talk about hackathons and what makes a great hackathon now this is a kind of a trendy thing where a lot of companies are doing hackathons right now it might be just something that's open to employees internally or you might invite outside guests in to a hackathon but we have had the privilege of being participants in hackathons hackers if you will as well as organizers of hackathon so having seen things from both sides of the fence so to speak we had some thoughts that we want to share with you about what goes well and what doesn't go well so first of all let's talk kind of The Blocking and tackling stuff organization and Logistics David what are the things that we need to be thinking about in planning a hackathon well one of the first things and one of the one of the first things we had to deal with here with our recent killer video one was the publicity standpoint right making sure we're getting out to not only the developers anyone who might be involved they know what the hackathon is about if there's any particular information they need are there facilities that you need to worry about you know are you going to be in a big Hall are you going to have a bunch of different rooms um you know and the one key thing too is we had to encourage we had to encourage a lot of our teams encourage people to kind of form teams and stuff beforehand as well start we want to get all that going so by the time we actually went to the hackathon and we did it we kind of had um all that stuff really in place yeah because yeah that's right you have a limited time so you don't want to waste time on team formation and organization yeah as a matter of fact to add to that one of our in our particular case dealing with killer video right if people were going to hack at all against our code base they had to You Know download not only the code base they had to get a Docker in some internal things working there in the laptop so we went ahead ahead of time we talked to teams we tried to kind of offer say uh any kind of I.T support or anything they needed to get them going because we only had a day and we didn't want to be spending two three hours right there in the morning just trying to get people to you know get the code download and everything so that was actually part of that Outreach right and then um so I guess along those lines um I guess I'll ask you Jeff what what kind of instructions or anything you know do you give beforehand you know was there any particular material there yeah I think it's important to think about what your objectives are for your hackathon what are you trying to get out of it uh are you trying to get Innovation that's focused on a particular area are you looking for new technology ideas are you looking for product feature brainstorming uh or maybe you have some organizational goals you know just as a morale boosting event or promoting cross-team interaction for us it was a bunch of those things it was you know everything that I just mentioned plus uh with a focus like like you've hinted already on the killer video so our reference application that we're building to demonstrate features of our product line data sacks Enterprise Studio op Center Etc just the whole product line that we're trying to be able to demonstrate with killer video we're looking for ideas so from our engineering team which is a world-class engineering team the people who are designing and building these great features you know on top of the base Apache Cassandra technology we want to get ideas they have about how to use the features that they're building because they have a lot of great inspiration about that so that was a major objective of ours and we were pretty honest with them about you know that's a goal that we want to get new ideas for this reference app so like like I mentioned if we want to have that focus and point the teams in a direction how do we do that or how do you give that direction to teams without constraining them and tying their hands yeah yeah so um I guess maybe a philosophy we try to use was guardrails not handcuffs right so we knew that we had constraints we had things that we that we needed to um well we wanted folks to focus on maybe some topics or some suggestions but at the same time we don't want to constrain folks so much that they just kind of lose their creative ability to do something that either interests them or you know to to kind of let the whole process be organic right so what we did was you know we set up some topics we set up some suggestions we said here are some things that you could do right but honestly you can you can kind of pick whatever now there's still some constraints there even if they pick whatever in order for the hackathon in our particular case to actually be successful because it was a killer video hackathon right we did have to have some constraints like you know it needs to be in the killer video Universe right if you go off and you hack something it has nothing to do with killer video whatsoever and it's totally outside of it that's not really the point so that's kind of iot demo it'd be great you know but it'd be useful to us right but that's where the guard rails not handcuffed so again giving enough constraints of people have Focus they have suggestions one of the things we saw um when we had created uh some of the original like survey forms and stuff to get people going and everything was that you know people were asking like wow man what topic should I pick and so it was good to have some suggested topics for them even though they may have gone in a different direction it was just giving them a starting point so that was yeah some teams you got to get out of their way and just let them go and then other teams are coming to you will what should we work on what should we code and then you you know have to have a couple ideas to give them right so they're just not dead in the water right so enough constraints to get them going and and kind of keep them on in the area that you're you're one on the work but not so many that they can't be creative and organic and stuff and how yeah everything kind of flows on its own okay very good so I think maybe what we want to do at this point is actually show you some highlights from some of the demos that we did um one of the first teams that I'd like to show you here is the team we called killer video Geo so one of the things that this team did was great this is actually a team that works a lot of the members have experience with datastax Studio which is our relatively new developer application and as you can see here they added map visualization to Studio in a day yes so they enriched some of our test data that you can see here and then did a map UI plug-in and then we're able to visualize the user locations so you know there are different users who can who have accounts within the killer video system and we're able to see where they're located and visualize where our users are on the map now look this is like a safe harbor statement here where we're not guaranteeing that that map visualization is going to be available right at any particular time frame but just to show that it was a fairly easy you know uh thing for them to demonstrate in terms of you know getting that into the application and then demonstrating it within a day yeah yeah absolutely and then if we if we move on to the next one here Jeff we've got our team uh sad Tigers right and uh let's see when the video comes up here there we go yeah so this is team sad Tigers now this is really interesting because what they did is they ended up working a recommendation engine using spark now this really starts to lending this organic thing we were talking about before because we gave folks ideas uh but we didn't say recommendation engine and we actually had two teams funny enough that came up with a way to do recommendation engines on their own and in this particular case they use an analytics approach right with spark now we're going to talk about the other one here in a moment where they use an online approach right with graph but we didn't plan that we did not tell people to do this and it was actually something that was in our internal killer video roadmap that we wanted to tackle so it actually worked out really kind of beautiful yeah and the fact that two teams came up with that idea that was something that was actually part of our intent to implement yeah we just felt like we got this wealth of content and potential ideas on how to do this so let's go right to that next team so this is the output that we got from what was that team Rock Solid and I want you to hear this you just saw what would be like a bash offline analytics overnight all the users recommendations so you know if you have that kind of time and you don't have any new users that want personalized recommendations they're cold start scenario and yada yada yada and things don't change over the course of the day even though we work for a company that operates in The Power of Now right so okay so that's a little audio from our friend Bob yeah Bob Brody uh and he is actually kind of trash talking the other recommendation engine team there he's talking about how there's uh you know if offline analytics with running spark jobs is good enough for you and you're you're not going to operate in The Power of Now which is kind of our data Stacks slogan marketing slogan if you're not going to embody that uh maybe that's good enough for you with the spark analytics but we did the online recommendation engine it was this kind of this fun interplay and give and take between the teams so like tell me a little bit about like about this particular recommendation engine implementation yeah so this one this one um compared to the spark analytics approach right this one used graph right and it is it is online so uh you know this one would be more real time now what's what's really interesting is um that at the end once we looked at what both teams had done uh it actually came to us that both of their recommendation implementations were actually parts of the whole that both of them were valid within not only doing something in the online standpoint but there was some information that you can't gain online that you need the analytics data that you're actually you know kind of computing and stuff over the over the course of the day or longer to actually get at um so both of these uh particular cases are something that you know a matter of fact is going to end up being uh really quite quite useful for us so it actually it worked out so one totally took down the line standpoint the other one took the analytics so you know like all joking aside and US sort of pitting them against each other realistically they were actually producing complementary Solutions yeah so and it probably wasn't an accident I mean maybe we take credit for it maybe we don't about sort of creating that uh friendly rivalry kind of atmosphere so I don't know if you want to share a little bit more about that how we did that well yeah so uh we wanted to make sure I mean obviously you know with the hackathon the end goal is you you actually want to get work done you want to do things and have some outcome and everything but you also want to have fun I mean that was part of it so what we did is one of the things is as the teams had formed and they actually started like punching out code and everything like that we just quietly started showing up with um like walking up the tables and doing stuff like this let's see can you guys see this okay too much talking of coding that's right and yeah this one was my favorite actually we got some nice laughs out of that yeah the only sound I should hear right is you're mad typing on the keyboard so we just went around and we just obviously we're just having fun with it and we just started throwing this on the tables and and kind of purposely trying to loosen loosen up the atmosphere and kind of you know break maybe break some of the ice if there honestly I don't think we had that much ice breaking to do but our teams are pretty uh right right if they work well together yeah but um anyway yeah so that was one of the things that we we had done that so then you know I guess that that kind of ties into something like more on a more serious note like then how do you go about like what what do we do as far as judging the results like how do we kind of bring this all together right I've seen sort of uh varying degrees of of seriousness or realness in terms of you know do you have monetary prizes and recognition that's broadcast throughout the company and you know et cetera et cetera we ended up having some sort of nominal gift card 25 type of prizes that and and one of the things that we felt were important in terms of our feedback to the teams was giving everybody recognition finding because there were there were genuinely unique and good things that were contributed by each of the teams yeah and so we wanted to recognize that if you think about it uh you're gonna go participate in a hackathon you're kind of putting yourself on the line your your credibility is you know a little bit at risk here because you gotta produce the goods in a day you know produce something useful that you can then demonstrate and it better work because it would be embarrassing to fail in front of the other teams and so you know we wanted to recognize these people that are are really helping us out first of all in helping us to do our jobs better and you know we're also helping them by promoting the work that they're doing obviously but they've put themselves out there and we want to recognize that so that you know that was really important to us to do that yeah and one thing and to add on something that Jeff was just saying as well as far as the content and what they actually produced one of the things we actually did state was listen we're not looking for you to have unit tests we're not looking for a code to be absolutely production ready or something you'd never get it done within the time frames right that we had um so so it was important to us we we wanted to have um useful things um something that's functional hopefully you can take and do something with but we didn't go so stringent right and then the the one of the biggest things to make sure that everyone's doing this work right they spent all this day putting this stuff together you need to have some way to capture the results right so um we we had git repos we had documents we had stuff like that that we said okay here once you guys are done you guys have code we want you to put it up here we want you to put the information in you know this document that kind of deal simple just real real simple stuff easy stuff um so that's easy to forget yeah after math of an event like that yeah exactly so something something to make sure that we record that because you know in other videos if you've been watching um you know some of our other killer video talks uh you know the some of the graph stuff we're talking about that's it's actually we we are taking the stuff that came from the hackathon the output of that and we're actually going to turn that into real workable usable stuff in killer video perfect so just to summarize our key takeaways for having a successful hackathon is plan a lot communicate a lot be really flexible when your plans blow up because they will and then you know promote camaraderie amongst your teams recognize them thank them for their work and capture the results don't let that code Escape so really that's it for this time thanks again thank you",
