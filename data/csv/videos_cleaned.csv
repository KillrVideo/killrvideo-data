AI-powered applications live or die by Retrieval Accuracy. DataStax’s Hybrid Search with NVIDIA’s Reranker puts AI directly into Retrieval. This new approach to search retrieval changes the game on relevancy: Using an LLM to determine the most accurate result delivers up to 45% better accuracy over traditional methods, and Astra DB lets you combine AI-powered and classic search for best-in class RAG accuracy.

Hybrid Search combines the best of BM25 lexical search, vector search, and NVIDIA NeMo Retriever reranking to deliver more relevant results—all in one place.

Designed for developers and IT leaders, this session will dive into why hybrid search and auto-reranking are game changers for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents—and what’s at stake if you don’t use them.

What Problems Does This Solve?
Precision & Recall Boost – Hybrid search combines BM25 keyword matching with vector search, ensuring both relevance and contextual depth.
AI That Actually Understands Your Data – NVIDIA NeMo Retriever & Reranker elevate search accuracy by up to 45%, ensuring your AI retrieves and ranks the most contextually relevant results.
Scalability & Performance – DataStax Astra DB delivers sub-millisecond latency, supporting enterprise-grade AI at scale.
Enterprise-Ready AI Performance – Astra DB delivers low-latency hybrid search at scale, while MongoDB and others struggle with performance bottlenecks in high-query environments.
Hybrid Search Make Easier – With Langflow, developers can easily change and optimize state-of-the-art search accuracy for AI-driven applications with minimal code changes and no vendor lock-in.
How It Works:
Hybrid retrieval: Combines BM25 lexical search with vector search.
Smarter ranking: NVIDIA NeMo Retriever Reranking intelligently reorders results using fine-tuned LLMs.

Join Rachel Lee Nabors, head of developer relations at AgentQL by TinyQL, for a fascinating look at the future of the internet. 
 
In ten years, Internet Browsers may be a nostalgic memory. As enterprises face mounting API costs and integration headaches, a new paradigm is emerging. The internet's evolution from an open highway into a maze of walled gardens and monetized APIs has created significant challenges for businesses—but it has also set the stage for accessing and organizing the world’s information.

This lightning talk traces our journey from the invention of the browser to the arms race of scraping for data and access to it to the dawn of AI agents, showing how the challenges of today opened the door to tomorrow. See how technologies refined by the web scraping community are combining with large language models to create practical alternatives to costly API integrations.

From the rise of platform monopolies to the emergence of AI agents, this timeline-based exploration will help you understand where we've been, where we are, and where we're heading. Join us for a glimpse of how AI agents are enabling a return to the era of free information with ""the web as the API.”

2024 marked a significant breakthrough in Generative AI, demonstrating that higher accuracy could be achieved by producing more tokens during inference or test-time. This approach, while promising, unveiled new challenges: increased inference costs and slower response times. As we continue to push the boundaries of test-time compute, it's becoming evident that a balance between accuracy and efficiency is crucial for the next phase of AI development: agentic ai.

Moving into 2025, agents are poised to take center stage in AI applications, necessitating faster test-time compute on a diverse set of smaller language models (SLMs). Traditional GPU infrastructure is reaching its limits in efficiently supporting and scaling these agentic applications. This is where SambaNova's RDU architecture emerges as a solution, offering a faster and more efficient alternative for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs). This lightning talk will explore how SambaNova is empowering developers to build faster agentic applications, featuring a case study that underscores the critical need for accelerated agent inference in real-world scenarios.

In this talk from RAG++ NYC, Maria Khalusova, a developer advocate at Unstructured, introduces the Unstructured Serverless API, which preprocesses data from 25 different unstructured file types such as PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, markdown files, and emails. She explains how to extract textual data and metadata from these formats into a standardized JSON structure. You'll also learn how to orchestrate and scale batch data processing from over 20 storage sources using Unstructured Ingest, and seamlessly integrate the results into your preferred vector database. By the end, you'll understand how to optimize data preprocessing for better use of unstructured data in RAG applications.

You know how to work with application data but making the jump to AI? Is this you? Come learn how to unlock the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) with your Apache Cassandra data! Join us for a workshop designed specifically for teams currently utilizing Apache Cassandra, DataStax Astra and DataStax Enterprise. 

In this session, you'll learn:
--The Basics of Generative AI: This session will help you understand the parts of Generative AI and why it's becoming an indispensable feature in the tech landscape. We'll demystify GenAI technologies and discuss their relevance to data-driven organizations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG). Vector Search. Large Language Models. LangChain. LlamaIndex. Embeddings. A lot of words but we’ll help you get up to speed. 
--How Cassandra Fits: Learn how recent changes to Cassandra have made this even more accessible. Even with older versions of Cassandra, there are interesting use cases to be had. 
--Three Steps to Integration Success:
Step 1: Identifying Opportunities - Finding use cases and narrowing them down to your first POC. 
Step 2: Implementing Solutions - From the simple to the more complex, you will be surprised how simple it is to start and show results. A large volume of code and libraries exist to get you from idea to production quickly. 
Step 3: Measuring Impact and Iterating - Learn how to effectively measure the success of your GenAI projects and use these insights to iterate and improve continuously. We'll discuss KPIs, feedback loops, and strategies for scaling GenAI initiatives.
--Live Q&A Session: Have your questions answered by our experts in real time. Whether you're curious about technical details, implementation strategies, or potential challenges, we're here to help. We’ll also give you ways to keep the conversation going after the fact. It’s never a one-and-done!

--Connect to any enterprise data source 
--Segment and embed data into vectors in Astra DB.
--Use a RAG stack architecture for ingestion, embedding, and prompt retrieval  
--Bring it all together in a user-friendly chatbot

Let’s take a deep dive into emerging architectures of Generative AI products at industry-leading companies like Instacart and Shopify.  We discuss how these companies built custom Gen AI products with their own unique datasets, using technologies like vector search, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), LangChain, and more. 

Learn from Alejandro Cantarero, field CTO of AI at DataStax. Alejandro built a generative AI product for support agents to rapidly answer inquiries at Shopify and designed real-time embedding pipelines to power recommendations and propensity to purchase models at Tribune Publishing and the LA Times. 

Alejandro uncovers:


-Generative AI architecture and design patterns for agents, text, and retrieval augmented generation
-Using vector search and LangChain to add context to LLMs

However, one will quickly realize that the out-of-the-box performance is not optimal for high-volume use cases. This talk won't provide cookbook recipes for tuning Pulsar instead, you will learn a systematic approach to performance tuning. The high-level mental model of the Pulsar write and read path is explained, since this helps to understand what needs to be tuned. The tunable configuration is covered at a high level. Different options for horizontal and vertical scaling of Pulsar deployments are also covered. If you are interested in learning more about Apache Pulsar operations and performance tuning, join Lari Hotari to learn about this fascinating topic.

With the Astra DB Plugin for HashiCorp Vault, application token management can be delegated to HashiCorp Vault, which allows associating metadata with tokens and helps track creation, rotation and revocation of the tokens, and logs token ownership and usage. It is also now possible to create dynamic tokens and lease them for a limited period of time. This allows additional security controls for Astra DB tokens and enhances the security posture for Astra DB.

Note that to use the plugin, it is required to have a functional HashiCorp Vault deployment. The HashiCorp Vault plugin for Astra DB is offered as an open source plugin and can be downloaded from here. Please refer to the technical documentation to install and use the HashiCorp Vault Plugin for Astra DB.

You can also create new database tables directly via the API. The built-in GraphQL Playground servlet makes it easy to prototype your mutations and queries and experiment with new approaches.

The Stargate GraphQL API comes in two ""flavors"":
CQL-first: you provide the CQL tables, Stargate generates the GraphQL schema. 
Schema-first: you provide a GraphQL schema, Stargate generates the tables.
In this demo we'll show both, and explain how to switch from one to the other.

.. or read on!  Some data needs more expressive data modeling in order to derive insights from it.  Graph databases enable richer data modeling with a simpler syntax over relational databases.  Quine has it’s roots in DARPA research and is the first in-memory streaming graph that supports real-time, event-driven workflows.  It enables high volume, low signal complex event processing like:
* Fraud detection
* Real-time recommendation engines
* Master data management (MDM)
* Network and IT operations
* Identity and access management (IAM)
Quine is a streaming graph capable of building real-time graph insights on streaming data as-is-happens, as well as for the data to be streamed-out for event processing.   The graph data is stored on disk through a configured persistent store with out-of-the-box support for Cassandra or Astra DB. When using Cassandra/Astra, Quine instances can achieve extremely high throughput, high availability, data replication, and failover strategies needed for production operation in the enterprise.

Long-running tasks (workflows) are a great fit for serverless databases, as are most “bursty” workloads that give infrastructure a chance to scale down (incurring no further usage costs until the next request).
Temporal Requires a database, and Astra DB, built on Apache Cassandra, offers Temporal users:
- Managed service simplicity
- Serverless pricing and autoscaling
- Secondary indexes (SAI)
- Global, multi-region active/active deployment
- Deployment to all major cloud providers

Pulsar Functions are a powerful way to create streams of data. In a more advanced pattern, Functions can not only watch (subscribe to) multiple topics but they can also send their output (produce) to multiple topics. This video shows both these patterns in to practice with a function that filters messages based on their content.

We’re going to look at a feature of Pulsar called shared subscriptions. Typically in Pub/Sub a message topic has only one subscriber. Challenges arise when a flood of messages are published very quickly. That single subscriber can become overwhelmed. A shared subscription type means many consumers can subscribe to the same topic and share the workload of consuming all those messages.

We’re going to look at a feature of Pulsar called failover subscriptions. Sometimes message consumers get backed up or crash all together. To help guard against that, you can have one or more consumers on standby, waiting to help. Setting the subscription type to failover tells Pulsar that when a primary consumer becomes unresponsive, a secondary should be promoted.

In this 2 hour workshop, you’ll learn to create your own AI-based text classifier and make it easily accessible as a simple REST API.
By using a database as a cache layer, you will improve the performance of the API.

We’ll assume you have working Python knowledge. From there, we build with Keras (Tensorflow), Fast API, pedantic and  Astra DB, a serverless DBaaS built on Apache Cassandra. This is an interactive workshop, so you will go through the whole process yourself with our 100% hands-on session! 

During the workshop, you will:
  - prepare the labeled dataset for model training
  - train the model to classify any input text
  - export the trained model and test it interactively
  - create your free NoSQL database for data storage
  - set up and start an API exposing the classifier as a reusable class!
  - learn how to speed up the API with DB-based caching
  - inspect how a streaming response is handled in the API

* Create a target database on Astra DB.
* Navigate to the data loader page, but instead of loading a prebuilt dataset or uploading a file, provide the S3 bucket details for a DynamoDB export.
* The instructions on the screen help you create, set permissions, and get the key / bucket information. There are also a couple of key / bucket combinations in github you can use for testing.
* Walk through the upload screens to kick off the async job. 
* Wait for success (or error) in an email.

Quarkus is a Java framework and runtime built on technologies and standards familiar to most Java developers. It's reactive at its core, boasting extremely fast boot times and low memory utilization, while providing near-instant scale-up. This is critical for JVM apps when running on high-density container platforms such as Kubernetes. It offers a great developer experience, with capabilities such as live coding, continuous testing, and so on. If you’re a Spring or Java developer/architect, this workshop is meant for you!! Even if you’re a novice Java developer you will be able to follow along and level up your skills.

While this demo won’t transform you into a power cloud-native programmer or architect overnight, you’ll learn by doing and taking some baby steps towards the transition. In this session, you’ll start from scratch by installing GraalVM and will learn how to hook up your Quarkus app to AstraDB and end up packaging it as a native app (goodbye JVM), all from a cloud-based IDE. You will also look at features of the platform such as hot reloading, debugging, etc., which make development a joy again!

Because the Document API uses schemaless data, no data modeling is required!  This short demo shows how to use the built in swagger client.
You can get the Javascript 'Collections' client for Astra from NPM ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrajs/collections )
To use the Document API, you must define the namespace that will store collections. Collections store unstructured JSON documents. Documents can themselves hold multiple documents. Multiple collections are contained in a namespace, but a collection cannot be contained in multiple namespaces.
Only namespaces need to specifically created. Collections are specified when a document is inserted.

We will discuss integration patterns with Apache Pulsar and how to deploy a Pulsar end-to-end solution integrated with Cassandra and ElasticSearch and a 3rd party REST API - we will perform data modifications in the data pipeline and send it to another system. We will also discuss different ways of connecting Pulsar to systems using Pulsar IO connector and pulsar functions. We will finish up by showing you options for deploying and monitoring your system, and will take Astra Streaming for a spin!
